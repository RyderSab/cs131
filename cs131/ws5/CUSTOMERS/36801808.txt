Secure in the love of her large Italian family and thrilled to work as a seamstress for New York City's largest department store, she isn't so certain about men and marriage. Lucia cannot bear the thought of giving up the career that she loves and thus decides not to marry the seemingly suitable Italian man that she has loved since childhood. Then another man comes into her life-John Talbot, who seems to have all the handsomeness and excitement that Lucia craves. Lucia falls deeply in love, never guessing how the relationship and the things to come will change her comfortable world.<br /><br />\\"Lucia, Lucia\\" is one of those books that is sure to please on at least the \\"light reading\\" level. Lucia's joie de vivre is enjoyable, soothing, and uplifting and I also found the career versus marriage theme unique and interesting in this coming-of-age story. The \\"Italian\\" aspects of the novel are fun to read about, too. Although the story isn't always completely enthralling, this is a novel that will generally make the reader want to find out what happens to Lucia and her family.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Trigiani's writing style is not as fresh or charming as her main character. Her descriptions, phrasings, choices of words, and dialogues are written with average vocabulary and technique. You could say the writing was capable, the type that would work for a high school creative writing class, but it is not the kind of writing that is very literary.<br /><br />\\"Lucia, Lucia\\" deserves about 3.5 stars. It's impossible not to enjoy an appealing heroine and descriptions of glorious clothes, but slightly amateurish writing and a few cliches keep it from reaching its potential.	2005-07-19

Did she really have such an incredible impact on the charities she worked with? Deep down, was her personality as luminous and beautiful as many believed it was?<br /><br />Since her death almost a decade ago, numerous authors have offered their opinions on Diana's personality, charity work, marriage, and entire life. Some have been worshipful (Andrew Morton's \\"autobiography\\"), some have been disturbing (Sally Bledel Smith's examination of Diana's personality), and some have totally illuminated an area of the late princess's life.<br /><br />\\"Diana: The Portrait\\" falls into the latter category. The first thing Diana fans will notice is the abundance of stunning, high-quality photos from every phase of Diana's life. And these photos aren't just the same tired images. They are rare snapshots from the Spencer family collection and in many cases, ones that have never been seen by the public before. Even if you have other photography-oriented Diana books (I own two), this one is gorgeously superior.<br /><br />This volume also includes text with extensive detailings of Diana's charity work and her phenomenal rapport with \\"ordinary\\" people. Many Diana-themed books talk about her devotion to particular issues (like AIDS and land mines) but never fully discuss what she did or talk about her actions' tangible impacts. I have read a variety of books about the princess since her death and I have NEVER read a book that showed her impact on so many people so well or included so many varied sources praising her work.<br /><br />For better or for worse, \\"Diana: The Portrait\\" barely touches on some of the darker and more controversial issues of Diana's life. It mentions her divorce and the overwhelming changes she faced after her marrige, but \\"mentions\\" is the key word. Her eating disorders hardly factor into the book, and despite the fact that some have said Diana had psychological problems, this issue is never addressed. This probably occurred because her family was so involved in writing this book.<br /><br />But anyone who reads Diana books will quickly realize that one book can never tell everything about this woman who was such an enigma. To some, this book may seem to have airbrushed Diana's life, but it is also a beautiful and special tribute to a unique woman who is universally known. Forget about this book's lack of captions, and savor its other one-of-a-kind attributes.bly occurred because her family was so involved in writing this book.  <br /> <br />But anyone who reads Diana books will quickly realize that one book can never tell everything about this woman who was such an enigma.

In fact, it's such a shockingly brutal, ambitiously epic, deeply funny, and completely captivating novel that trying to describe it so coventionally could hardly work. Suffice to say that it's the story of Delores Price, who has tragedies worthy of Greek heroes and emotions that, however extreme, will resonate with any human being.<br /><br />Usually, when a book has the \\"Oprah's Book Club\\" seal on it, I don't even bother picking it up. Time after time, I've been disillusioned by the pretentious writing, exaggerated critical praise, and unlikeable characters in the books that Oprah chooses. Yet inexplicably, I was drawn to this book.<br /><br />I can tell you that it's not like other \\"Oprah's\\" books. Most importantly, Wally Lamb (other than Betty Smith) is definitely the most skilled author I've ever encountered. As a man, he captured a woman's (and more incredibly, a girl's) mindset better most female authors. He handles the story's plot and emotions with the precision and breathtaking skill of a tightrope walker-Delores's life is filled with every imaginable tragedy and \\"her\\" first person narrative is one of the rawest I've ever read, but Lamb never veers into the cloying melodrama that often ruins \\"Oprah\\" books. It's impossible to explain how he does it, but he definitely has a rare grasp of the human spirit and a one-of-a-kind ability to transfer its workings to paper.<br /><br />A piercingly insightful literary work, a page-turner, and a novel filled with humor in shocking places, \\"She's Come Undone\\" is above all a novel that you'll just have to read.	2005-07-01

She quotes credible sources, has done extensive study of primary documents, and writes in an informed and objective way about her subjects.<br /><br />In \\"Mrs. Kennedy,\\" these biography-writing skills sometimes result in fascinating reading. As an admirer of Jackie's persona, style, and intelligence, I loved learning little-known facts about her emotionally turbulent upbringing and the psychological reasons behind her univerally admired sense of style. The changing thoughts she had about politics, her masterful way of managing cultural and social elements of the White House, and the important diplomatic role she played in her husband's administration were also well-explored.<br /><br />But after that, there's little left to admire about \\"Mrs. Kennedy.\\" First of all, Jackie is not the main character that she is advertised to be in the book's title. It almost seemed like the author recounted JFK's actions, failures, and relentless womanizing during the presidency and only then talked about how Jackie reacted to these things.<br /><br />This was very disappointing, especially to a reader like me who is primarily interested the Kennedy women and not the male side of the family. The intense focus on JFK's life during this period also resulted in horrifically boring sections of the biography that delved far too deeply into events like the Cuban Missile Crisis...events that hardly involved Jackie.<br /><br />Finally, although JFK's callous womanizing would have definitely affected Jackie's life profoundly, Leaming's habit of  constantly mentioning each of the \\"other\\" women and describing their affairs became aggravatingly redundant. It made it appear like Leaming had nothing more compelling to say about Jackie herself.<br /><br />Unless you have a penchant for dull textbooks or want to read everything published about JFK, skip the deceptively titled \\"Mrs. Kennedy.\\"	2005-07-01

After a terrible childhood and bitter relationships with her family, she's had trouble with her boyfriend, Wesley. Desperate, she cold-heartedly steals his truck and money, discovers she's pregnant, and lands in the small town of Pembina Lake. In this small town, filled with adults with sorrows of their own, Noreen slowly moves past her hatred and hidden sorrow.<br /><br />After reading this book's jacket, I was convinced that I would love it. \\"True Confessions of a Heartless Girl\\" appeared to be the type of book that would have intriguing characters and be insightfully written yet effortlessly readable.<br /><br />Well, it wasn't.<br /><br />Initially, the book is promising, as it is filled with quick and riveting descriptions of Noreen during her childhood and her time with Wesley. But once Noreen actually arrives in Pembina, the plot slows so much and becomes somehow so sparse that it was hard to read more than ten pages of the book at a time. The events were painfully and almost artificially \\"normal\\" and dialogue can only be called run-of-the-mill. Brooks also has a habit of drably describing all of the characters' mundane activities (like coloring with crayons) and all of the town's scenery that becomes more aggravating with each chapter.<br /><br />The \\"subtle\\" writing style (if we must be polite and call it that) is made worse by that fact that the story is, well, cliche. There are so many young adult books explore similar themes-teen preganacy, the effects of a bad childhood, and how a stranger can change people's lives-that another one is unnecessary unless it is actually compelling.<br /><br />It is impossible to imagine why this book won such praise in Canada. A few well-done passages do nothing to hide the fact that this book is as bleak and colorless as Noreen is heartless. Instead of this book, try Sharon Creech's \\"Walk Two Moons\\" or Margaret Wild's \\"One Night.\\"	2005-06-21

Aurora has a childhood filled with mystery and confusion. She lives with her maternal grandparents for a time, and then spends the rest of her life with formidable paternal grandmother Paulina del Valle. In \\"Portrait In Sepia,\\" melancholy, instrospective Aurora remembers and chronicles her life. Slowly, as she travels from California to Chile to England and back, she is able to make sense from a life that formerly was as clouded as a portrait in sepia.<br /><br />In some ways, \\"Portait in Sepia\\" is exotically enchanting. Allende always seems to avoid pedestrain settings, and the effortless blend of American, Chinese, and especially Chilean settings makes for an intoxicatingly different reading experience. Characters such as Eliza Sommers, Tao Chi'en, and Paulina del Valle, previously introduced in \\"Daughter of Fortune\\" are also back in this story. Generally, their continued stories contain expanded characterizations and interesting twists that will please any Allende reader.<br /><br />The complex cast of characters, the wide scope of the story, and the plot that consists of an infinite number of dramatic events is, at its best, reminiscent of \\"perfect\\" epics like \\"Gone With the Wind.\\" At its worst, this story can make you want to turn the page and see if the next happening is more exciting. Sometimes there was too much Chilean history, other times Aurora seemed riduculously tragedy-ridden, occasionally a prosy passage just wasn't as breathtaking as it was designed to be, and then there were those moments when the dramatic story line too closely resembled a TV soap.<br /><br />If this book were from a newer and less-acclaimed author, I would enthusiatically give it four stars and declare it totally promising. But it's from Isabel Allende-an internationally known author with books on college reading lists and millions of critics lavishing praise on every book.

Can she ever learn to to be truly happy with herself, her life in general, and her cups that runneth over?<br /><br />This book definitely has its funny moments (and even a fabulous fudge recipe included). Any book that makes such excellent use of British slang (\\"squodged\\" and \\"wobbly bits\\" are among the linguistic gems) has some laugh-out-loud appeal. And \\"My Cup Runneth Over\\" is certainly the kind of breezy little read that's great when one just needs a mindless period of relaxation.

Helen is a serious, smart girl who wants to be a plastic surgeon and is uncomfortably aware of her previously deformed face. By chance, the two meet at a party that Helen reluctantly went to with a friend. Somehow, Helen and Gabe connect emotionally in an almost magical way and she is pregnant before the night is over. Helen is forced to deal with a life that changes each day in frightening and awe-inspiring ways.<br /><br />Yes, this book is written in free verse. But as someone who usually shuns poetry, I can say that this style resulted in some of the most mind-blowingly moving images I have ever encountered in a novel. \\"One Night\\" is a quick read, composed of many one-or two paged poems that are each meant to chronicle a particular event or feeling in the lives of Helen, Gabe, and those connected to the two main characters. The poems vary in length, yet Wild writes them in such a way as to make every single word count. With surprisingly few words, she captures Gabe's desolation, Helen's powerful spirit, the upheaval the pregnancy causes, and the pain of labor. Wild is able to write in a way that will keep teens reading, but also to express controversial issues and wrenching emotions in ways that would make great authors proud. This is one of those books that you \\"travel\\" through with a racing heart, wanting to absorb every word of each poem, yet rushing ahead to find the next stunning line from this author's pen. With its simplicity yet depth and its hopeful ending, \\"One Night\\" is a book that will leave an impression.	2005-06-05

Although she is raised by a wealthy English family, she is told that she was mysteriously left in a basket on the Sommerses' doorstep when she was a few days old. Eliza grows up as privileged English girl, cloistered in a protected environment by her spinster guardian, Miss Rose. But Eliza's seemingly unchanging life is suddenly changed when she is on the verge of womanhood. She falls madly in love with Joaquin Andieta, a destitute, melancholy revolutionary who is anything but a \\"desirable\\" suitor. Eliza is quickly caught up in all the complexities of her love- complexities which soon lead her to 1840s California and the realization that she is becoming a completely different woman than she imagined.<br /><br />The minute anyone begins to read this book, one thing is certain to strike them-Allende is a supremely capable storyteller. A overwhelming majority of the time, she creates a rich, complex story with enough characters, cultures, and drama to satisfy anyone. Certainly, the fusion of Chilean, Chinese, and Californian cultures in this novel is one that will be remembered.<br /><br />However, despite the masterful nature of Allende's style and historical backgrounds, \\"Daughter of Fortune\\" falls short of being five-star fiction. First, after reading more than the first section of the book, the ending can easily be deduced. It's an ending that readers will want, so that's not necessarily a terrible thing. But at the book's close, rather than capitalizing on this fitting ending and wrapping things up skillfully, things were finished hastily and I felt nagging dissatisfaction by the characters' final interaction.<br /><br />Also, Eliza had potential to be a character nearly as perfect as Scarlett O'Hara, yet fell short of truly blossoming. Yes, readers were able to \\"get inside\\" their courageous heroine's mind some, but not enough to really feel like Eliza was truly \\"alive.\\"<br /><br />This was my first Allende book, and I feel that the few flaws in the novel were generally overcome by the enticing and well-written style. It probably deserves about 3.5 stars. I will definitely be looking for more of Allende's books, and hope that she can summon her talents even more to create the kind of book that I will enthusiastically give five stars.Eliza was truly \\"alive.\\"   <br /> <br />This was my first Allende book, and I feel that the few flaws in the novel were generally overcome by the enticing and well-written style.

They completely capture my attention and are filled with ordinary people yet breathtaking insights. In \\"The Art of Mending,\\" however, some of this magic is missing.<br /><br />This story of a middle-aged woman who travels to visit her parents and siblings only to be forced to confront secrets from her past would not seem so disappointing if it came from a first-time or inexperienced author. But coming from Berg, its flaws are even more obvious. The fact that this novel contains some expertly written passages and the \\"trademark\\" grains of truth does not cover up the fact that on nearly every front, something is missing from the book.<br /><br />First and foremost, Berg does not deal well with the issue of childhood abuse. She's effectively incorporated themes like coming of age, love, \\"singleness,\\" and death into her other books, seeming to completely understand each of these complicated things. With childhood abuse, it's a completely different story. Her character who coped with the issue seems whiny, abstract, and unlikable and the reason presented to explain the parent's abuse was flimsy. Once Berg really began to delve into the family's reaction to these secrets, she just ended the book! And yes, it was definitely the kind of ending that could be found in a Lifetime movie.<br /><br />The flaws of Laura, the main character, mirrored the problems of the rest the book-she lacked that \\"something\\" that usually separates a Berg book from other books out there. Somehow, she resembled previous Berg characters too much. Her childhood seemed like a blend of the childhoods described in the \\"Durable Goods\\" series and \\"What We Keep,\\" and the whole \\"family secrets\\" aspect of the book mirrored \\"What We Keep\\" as well. Or maybe, Laura was just a character who was too ordinary for even Berg to make interesting.<br /><br />I can only hope that the next Berg book I read completely showcases her precious gifts of empathy and insight.

Since she lives in Virginia, she is straddled between the two sides,  surrounded by family and friends whose views about the war are usually conflicting. Annie's older brother Laurence is a soldier in the Confederate army who is increasingly dismayed by the viciousness, confusion, and senselessness of the war. Her younger brother Jamie, however, seems to embrace the very aspects of the war that Annie and Laurence hate. Annie is coming to realize the immorality of slavery, but she is still willing to take daring measures to help defend her homeland from Federal troops. Yet perhaps the hardest part of the war for Annie is that she begins to fall in love with Thomas Walker, an honorable man who shares her love of poetry, but is a Yankee.<br /><br />  \\"Annie, Between the States\\" is an excellent novel largely because it forces readers to realize how strikingly heart wrenching the Civil War was, especially to those who lived in border states.  More than glamorized novels like \\"Gone With the Wind,\\" this book shows how war often offers no solutions and no black-and-white courses of action.<br /><br />  L.M. Elliott developed her main character superbly as well. In the opening chapter of the novel, Annie seems overly \\"ladylike\\" and a bit spoiled, frightened to the point of inaction when war is near her. Annie soon overcomes these tendencies, however, and before the war is too far along, she is displaying the kind of intelligence, strength, bravery, and maturity that will have readers lost in 1860s Virginia. Her two relationships-with Thomas Walker and the Confederate soldier William Farley-are incredibly moving as well.<br /><br />  Initially, the historical facts woven into the storyline seemed too much like something in a text book. Yet quickly, Elliott seemed to become much more adept at keeping the battle details from being too cumbersome. The intriguing Southern general Jeb Stuart and the one-of-kind Confederate soldier John Mosby were perfect additions to this story.<br /><br />  This is about as well-done a historical fiction novel as you are going to find.

Binchy was not at all flowery; I found myself enjoying her reliance on realistic dialogue and \\"ordinary\\" thoughts and settings. It is not the most penetratingly insightful or skillful writing that I have ever read, but for this often simple story, it usually works. This story of Elizabeth White and Aisling O'Connor, their unlikely friendship, and their unusually strong bond resonated with me, as it should with anyone who has a \\"total\\" best friend.<br /><br />The final aspect of  \\"Light a Penny Candle\\" that struck me was its almost dark feel at times. Unlike other writers of this genre (whatever it may be called) who hesitate to write about any characters who make controversial decisions or deal with issues that seem to have no resolution, Binchy plunges her characters into these situations. Bad relationships and marriages, imperfect families, and abortion are all touched on.<br /><br />Granted, \\"Light a Penny Candle\\" ends on a rushed and somewhat inconceivable note...a note, I'm sorry to say, that is reminiscent of some of the shabbier writing in this genre. Yet Maeve Binchy has undeniable skill at writing about life, frienship, and the things that matter.	2005-03-30

His book is characterized by research, depth, and scope. What's more, he doesn't resort to cheap sensationalism to add a few more chapters. Yet somehow, \\"Monarch\\" is still one of those books that doesn't just capture you and leave you gushing about how wonderful it was.<br /><br />Lacey begins his book by attempting to chronicle the development of the \\"modern\\" royal family, beginning with reign of Queen Victoria and providing glimpses into several other monarchs' rule. It would be true to say that these \\"foundations\\" help one understand the current queen. Occasionally, this extended history lesson was just plain fascinating, too, imparting nuggets of history that any royal buff delights in.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the history lessons definitely became too textbook-ish at times, too. Lacey has an extremely unfortunate habit of seeming to bring up every single name, place, and government activity when talking about an event. This leaves the reader with an overly long and dull account of event that could have been summed up much more interestingly.<br /><br />The same analysis, to a lesser extent, holds true for the queen's own story in this book. At times, Lacey fabulously describes people and events, knows just where to place a well-chosen quote, and makes one want to read about the queen's life forever (as in the opening chapters about the queen's dealings with Diana's funeral). Yet the \\"bogged-down-in-boring-detail\\" problem still surfaced in this part (the parts dealing with the Margaret-Townsend affair were dry and too long).<br /><br />Lacey is certainly to be commended for his obvious knowledge about the queen, and it is also fortunate for readers that he is able to convey his respect for the queen while still offering up intelligent, constructive criticism. If you really must read everything about the British royal family or the queen, this is a solid offering, yet other readers would probably enjoy Carolly Erickson's masterfully written \\"Lillibet\\" much more.bably enjoy Carolly Erickson's masterfully written \\"Lillibet\\" much more.	2005-03-19

Certainly, it was apparent that she had problems-bulimia, moodiness,affairs-but Charles completely to blame, right? It seemed that Diana was fine until she was undermined by Charles and the supposedly horrible royal family.<br /><br />But I have to say that this account has forced my to remove Diana from the altar I'd placed her on. Usually, a biography that was so ruthlessly slanted would not sway me so much, yet I see no reason why Bedell Smith would have written something so damaging to Diana's image if it were not true. She's not well-connected to Charles or the royal family...and she's American. But more than this lack of bias, Bedell Smith's conclusions are based on plain-old, cold-hard facts. She extensively quotes newspapers, books, Diana's own words, and a varied group of people (both friends and others) who knew Diana to prove her thesis about Diana's personality disorder.<br /><br />This book is so disturbing and so saddening because it challenges what most of us Diana fans have always thought. According to Smith, Diana was paranoid, selfish, popularity-starved, immature, possessive, and not even that stellar of a charity patron. Smith chronicles Diana's bizarre behavior with lovers, her shoddy treatment of friends, her refusal to obtain necessary psychological help, her immature \\"games\\" with newspaper editors, and the way she handled charity patronage toward the end of her life. Unfortunately, by the time you have finished the book, Smith's impeccable, thorough analysis will leave you hard pressed to argue that Diana WAS stable.<br /><br />Some might say that some of these incidents could have been unfairly recounted by the author. But a vast majority of the unpleasant portrayals contain black and white facts that cannot be twisted or \\"fudged.\\" Really, how can one deny a police report of Diana's 300-plus calls (over a period of weeks) to her married lover?

When I first saw this book, I figured that it would contain a story as perfect as its cover. Well, not quite.<br />It wouldn't be fair to say that &quot;Once Upon A Time&quot; has no redeeming qualities. If nothing else, it seems to be the only in-print biography of Grace Kelly-which makes it somewhat valuable for anyone trying to learn about this famous lady. Also, it is written in a readable, conversational way-nothing overly &quot;intellectual.&quot; And one certainly couldn't say that this book is completely devoid of interesting people, quotes, or happenings. The story of Grace and Ranier is definitely one that would have some fascination almost regardless of how badly it was told.<br />Yet as I was reading this book, I had a nagging sense that it wasn't as &quot;unputdownable&quot; as it should have been. I'd often feel like stopping after reading a few pages and rarely felt like I was really &quot;getting into&quot; the book.<br />Perhaps this dullness can be explained by the fact that the book was just too long. The author repeated himself frequently, seeming to resort to variations on main ideas whenever he had nothing fresh to say. (He often mentioned something similar to this throughout the first half of the book: &quot;Although Grace was a successful career woman who seemed to have it all, she just needed her parents' approval.&quot;) Another similar problem was that the author tended to spend too much time recounting dull periods in the couple's lives. Finally, many included quotes just screamed, &quot;That completely didn't need to be said!&quot;<br />There are some enlightening passages and quotes in this book, but if you read it you'll often find the problems instead of the positives. If you're looking for a good royal biography, read &quot;Lilibet: An Intimate Portrait of Queen Elizabeth II&quot; instead.	2004-06-26

And she's just as good as before!<br />As I read this book, I realized once again why I delight in Elizabeth Berg's writing and the character of Katie. I love how, in Berg's hands, the writing never feels forced and Katie's narration just seamlessly carries the novel. I love how Katie is so &quot;truly&quot; created, so warmly human, that you just want to grasp the pages of the book and pull her out for a chat. I love how Katie interacts with the world; doing the most ordinary things and recounting her adventures with such joy for life and a rare intelligence. Yet most of all, I love how Berg makes Katie someone who can pull all the truth in the world out of a simple act like eating a butterscotch-dipped ice cream cone.<br />For anyone who is mourning the fact that they will never find another heroine as achingly excellent as L.M. Montegomery's Anne or Betty Smith's Francie, read &quot;True to Form.&quot; I think you'll find that Katie Nash can easily take her place with Anne and Francie.	2004-06-12

Through the voices of these girls-dutiful older sister Patsy and rebelliously clever middle daughter Anne-readers are completely drawn into the complex issues that plagued the Henry family. The hopeless life of the mentally ill in Colonial times is vividly shown, but this novel also adeptly shows something more striking. Indeed, what readers will remember most from this novel is the timeless story of what holds a family together and what tears them apart.<br />Patsy and Anne both fascinatingly narrate the story. Rinaldi captures Patsy's sense of duty and stability, and convincingly portrays the pressure that she felt from her father to be the \\"glue\\" that held the family together. But even as one sympathizes with Patsy's dilemma, they will also feel for Anne. Through her eyes, Rinaldi shows how perhaps the entire Henry family went mad along with their mother and wife. Tensions resulting from secrets and grudges within the family are thoughtfully shown.<br />\\"Or Give Me Death\\" seems even more impressive when Rinaldi says in her author's note that although the entire story is not true, there are powerful \\"threads\\" of truth in it-enough truth that Rinaldi's interpretation could seem quite probable.<br />It is refreshing to find a new angle in the life of an almost-tired historical figure. \\"Or Give Me Death\\" generally makes this new view into the life of Patrick Henry's family a riveting one and one that is also filled with deftly included pieces of colonial history. Other than the seeming improbability of Sarah Henry's ability to predict the future, \\"Or Give Me Death\\" will please fans of historical fiction who want in a glimpse into a lesser-known chapter of history.ho want in a glimpse into a lesser-known chapter of history.	2004-06-07

She and her 15-year-old sister, Tyler, are basically left to fend for themselves since their mother has died of breast cancer and their father seems to be only interested in burying his grief by running to his girlfriend. As if this virtual abandonment wasn't enough, Kate is pregnant. She has decided that no one but her sister is to help her with her delivery, and thinks that by careful maneuvering, she can keep her father from knowing about the baby once it is born. Amazingly enough, no one seems to notice that Kate is pregnant-not her father, not her teachers, not her friends. Their luck seems to hold for a time since they manage to keep the baby a secret for a time even after it is born. Yet ultimately, Kate's family and everyone else involved with the baby must come to a painful reckoning about Kate's pregnancy, its underlying causes, and how to deal with its raw and uncertain aftermath.<br />Anyone who picks up \\"Her Daughter's Eyes\\" will be struck by it unusual and supremely thought-provoking plot line. With a multitude of teen pregnancy stories around, it is to the author's credit that she has found her own memorable take on the topic. Certainly, \\"Her Daughter's Eyes\\" does begin well. The first few chapters paint a skilled picture of Kate and Tyler's troubled hidden lives, and Inclan's juxtaposing of opposing details (like the girls relaxing over chocolate milkshakes and yet frantically memorizing a pregnancy guide from Goodwill) makes Kate and Tyler's \\"journey\\" one that readers must keep following.<br />Unfortunately, this can't-put-downable style does not stay for the rest of the novel. Once Kate's baby is discovered (and especially once the baby's father is involved), the plot line slows to a crawl. Inclan spends much of the middle and latter parts of the book in various characters' heads, and not everyone's thoughts make for chapters as masterful as those at the book's beginning. Basically, everyone's \\"inner dialogue\\" becomes repetitive and falsely flowery. Kate's thoughts understandably center on being with and being able to keep her baby, the baby's father's anguished state of mind makes for constant regrets that he's ruined his life, and Kate's father mourns endlessly for his wife and his mistakes. All of these thoughts are valid, and could be effectively included, but a capable novelist will make sure that character perspectives are included often enough to show personalities and feelings effectively...but not so often that many pages seem awfully similar to the last.<br />The ending of this book was also disappointing. After all of the complex problems plaguing Kate's family were discussed, I thought the ending should have been a thorough, thoughtful exploration of how Kate and her family's life changed and how Kate's life took a new direction. It wasn't...instead, after a too-long middle, the book rushed to a lukewarm, shamelessly cliche conclusion about how Kate was \\"stronger now.\\"<br />The book has two strikes against it-repetive character revelations and a shockingly weak ending.

I thought it had a pretty cover and a relatively intriguing title, but didn't figure that Elizabeth II would be anyone who was fascinating enough to write about. But nonetheless, envisioning a book filled with an agonizingly boring chronicle of this seemingly &quot;deadly dull&quot; woman's life, I began &quot;Lilibet.&quot;<br />And was I ever in for a surprise! Carolly Erickson has done an outstanding job with this biography and completely captured the essence of this queen. The pages keep turning, and it is one of the highest compliments I can give to a biography to say that it &quot;reads&quot; like a good novel-I can certainly say that in this case. Chronicling the Queen's life from birth until 2002, Erickson uses a winning &quot;formula&quot; to ensure a satisfyingly complex character portrait.<br />Granted, the simple factual matter of &quot;Lilbet&quot; was admirable. Yet other characteristics make &quot;Lilibet&quot; so enjoyable. First, I enjoyed the quotes/testimonials from the queen and others that Erickson used. It sometimes seems in a biography that the quotes chosen are unremarkable and cliche, yet &quot;Lilibet&quot; includes sparklingly memorable quotes from those who know Elizabeth as well as intriguing &quot;morsels&quot; from the queen herself.<br />Furthermore, &quot;Lilibet&quot; was enhanced by the way English history (and crucial royal family events) were woven into the story line. These happenings are presented to the reader in a clear and interesting manner, and as said, they add richness to the story. Time and time again, Erickson deftly shows how events like the World War 2, the Wallis Simpson incident, and the scandals recently plaguing the royal family played their part in the life of the Queen.<br />But best of all, the author shows excellent psychological insights during her writing. When I think about why exactly I found this book so fascinating, I realize that it was due in part to the sharply intelligent analysis of Lilibet's character. Erickson does not portray the queen as a &quot;whitened&quot; saint or as a cruel elderly woman-she seems to understand and empathize with the queen's character enough to see both the good and the bad in it.<br />Solid facts, expert inclusion of history and background information, memorable psychological insight, and just plain an interesting read!

Or beautiful but shallow woman who loved nothing more than a good photo-op and seeing her soap-operaish life grab headlines? Most of us lean heavily toward one of the above perspectives of Princess Diana. Unfortunately, it seems that books dealing with the late princess also tend to be written in this black-and-white way.<br />Yet in &quot;Diana: Story of a Princess,&quot; authors Craig and Clayton offer material that paints a refreshingly different portrait of Diana. It certainly isn't black-and-white; instead, it emphasizes the complex and elusive character of this eternally puzzling person.<br />The biography begins with Diana's childhood, and although it may initially seem a slightly dry chronicle of Spencer family history and aristocratic titles, it quickly beomces much more compelling. It is obvious that the authors have put a tremendous amount of research into the book-this research translates into well-detailed account of every pivotal moment in her life. &quot;Diana, Story of a Princess&quot; is, if nothing else, a complete &quot;life portrait&quot; that Diana fans won't want to be without.<br />In my mind, however, this bio is much more than a simple chronicle of events because of the widely varying views and accounts presented about the princess. Everyone knows how Diana was a victim of the Charles-Camilla relationship, but does anyone know the disadvantages Charles faced as he entered the marriage? We all have heard of what a selfless charity worker Diana was, but did we ever know of her supposedly &quot;darker&quot; side during this sort of work? This book explores both &quot;sides&quot; of these issues and others. Through facts, first-person accounts, and their own intelligent, interesting, and balanced commentary, the authors attempt not to trash Diana or transform her into a saint, but simply to raise and explore questions about her true character.<br />Overall, this biography is certainly a success. It manages to be generally informative and intriguing-while avoiding the pitfalls of being too one-sided or sensational.s certainly a success.

She's plain, introverted, and her one great passion is her job as a nurse. Although she's not exactly discontent, Myra has resigned herself the fact that the rest of her life will be fairly uneventful. Yet then her former high school crush comes back into her life-the handsome, impossibly accomplished Chip Reardon. But Chip is no longer the perfect specimen he was. He is dying from a brain tumor, and Myra becomes his nurse. Then, their relationship deepens and they are both forced to confront horrifying, enormous, and unbelievably profound ideas about dying, death, the meaning of life, and falling in love.<br />Okay, you can stop rolling your eyes now! Admittedly, in the hands of a lesser author, &quot;Never Change&quot; would become a weepy, soap-operaish mess. Elizabeth Berg, on the other hand, has the intelligence, piericingly superb writing skills, and keen sense of character necessary to pull off such a tough subject.<br />What really makes &quot;Never Change&quot; such an unforgettable and deeply enjoyable read is Myra. From the the first chapter in which Berg effortlessly and precisely captures Myra's remembrance of longing to go her high school prom, she makes her character shine. And it's not that Myra shines because she is unique or unusually intelligent or accomplished-she is a memorable character because she is NONE of those things. Instead, throughout &quot;Never Change&quot; Myra's longings, wishes, thoughts, and perspectives resonate because of the deep truth that lurks behind their normalcy.<br />I also loved this novel because it never pretended to have all of the answers about dying. It showed the horribly grotesque and hideously frightening side of being terminally ill and brought up an endless of number of hard questions about the issue. Indeed, &quot;Never Change&quot; even ends with a somewhat nebulous stance on how a life should be lived after it has been touched by another's death. But this seeming wishy-washyness and lack of clear-cut opinions about death is genius. It is truly realistic, since who really know what death is like? Also, by allowing her characters (mainly Myra) to ponder aspects of death and dying without coming up with many answers, Berg takes her readers on a thoughtful &quot;journey&quot; and allows them to perhaps make up their own mind on the issues.<br />Finally, I relished the secondary characters included in the book. Since Myra is a traveling nurse who visits patients in their home, she comes into contact with an eclectic spectrum of humanity. All of these many patients-from a wounded drug dealer to a lonely yet intelligent elderly woman in a retirement facility-add new angles of insight and enjoyment to the story and are cleverly created to influence Myra in unique and &quot;fun to read&quot; ways.<br />Yes, it could have been a horrible book. And yes, the idea of Myra falling in love, over 35 years after last seeing him, with her dying high school crush sounds like a bit too much to swallow. But with her lovely characters, compassionate prose, and satisfyingly deft writing, Elizabeth Berg makes it so you wouldn't want to change a thing about this book.yness and lack of clear-cut opinions about death is genius.

In &quot;Open House,&quot; Berg has once again created a realistic main character whose story is easily readable. Also, she has retained the asset of using &quot;light&quot; and almost simple writing to convey wisdom and insight. And I've got to say it-&quot;Open House&quot; had a way of being just naturally charming and funny.<br />But somehow, when you thought about it, the story of Samantha's dealings with and recovery from her divorce seemed to be a little too cutesy and perfect. First of all, it appeared that the novel took place over about half a year. Sam's sadness, rage, and erractic behavior in the novel's beginning were VERY realistic emotions for a divorced woman to experience. But honestly, by the end of the novel, it seemed like Sam was just totally fine and thought life was charming and every minute of it was worth living. Put simply, you just can't recover from divorce that fast.<br />And what about Sam's method of employment-taking a different menial job each day? Um, hello. First of all, it made Sam look lazy and stupid-wouldn't she want to establish a decent, permanent career? And although she took in &quot;roomates&quot; as well to make money, couldn't she have used a little more than $5.15 an hour on a day job?<br />Finally, the love story of sorts between Sam and King was hard to swallow. King supposedly has a degree from MIT yet, like Sam, picks a different minimum-wage job every day. The reason? To be able to enjoy life and have variety in each day. I don't know about you, but that sort of characterization/reasoning just makes me want to roll my eyes. I know King was supposed to seem like he &quot;had it all together&quot; and knew what really mattered in life, but he really just seemed silly and an all-too-quick remedy for Sam's ailing love life.<br />Yes, the writing's good and there is definitely some wisdom here. I suspect that Berg did just as well as anyone could with this slightly sappy sort of story. But the sheer &quot;neatness&quot; of the divorce and the utter &quot;Hallmark-ishness&quot; of the love aspects of the story defintely detracted from my overall enjoyment.sdom here.

As an Irish immigrant to the U.S. in 1911, she doesn't expect the series of complications that leaves her and her sister alone and fending for themselves in New York City. But little by little, \\"Rose\\" (as she calls herself in America) finds that she is managing in this new life. She has a job at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory and is beginning to find friends. Yet will she feel that she still wants to be in America after the tragedy that is soon to befall her?<br />Auch generally handled her topic and her character with skill. Although I am an avid historical fiction reader who has definitely heard similar stories of immigration and settling in America, good writing and pacing kept this one from seeming \\"deja vu.\\" Rose and her sister will prove interesting especially to girls who read this novel, since it is fascinating to put yourself in the spirited Rose's \\"shoes\\" and see history though her eyes.<br />And indeed, Rose's spirit carries the novel as well. The first person narrative showcases her steely intelligence and resourcefulness, and her quick thinking and determination make her a suitable heroine. Although I found the author's habit of dropping Gs on words like \\"walking\\" (to imitate the Irish accent) a bit annoying, little can detract from the strength of this main character.<br />Finally, the development of the Triangle Shirtwaist fire in the story line was excellent. The author had obviously researched the topic thoroughly, since she described it (of course through Rose's eyes) with a breathtakingly complete but natural narrative. Also fascinating were the many \\"hard to find\\" facts about this fire that were seamlessly revealed throughout the book's final chapters.<br />My only real complaint with this novel was the fact that it seemed to end a little too abruptly. Following the fire, I would have really liked to seem more of what happened to Rose, instead of just finding the end of the novel! Did she become successful in America? Marry? Have children? I felt disappointed to \\"meet\\" this strong character and see such a small portion of her life.<br />In short, \\"Ashes of Roses\\" is a skillfully done book with interesting history and a well-drawn character.

His girlfriend got pregnant the previous year, decided that she couldn't handle raising the baby, and Sam felt a need to raise his son. Now, Sam's going to an alternative high school and juggling classes, college hopes...and baby Max. The mix only gets tougher when he meets Claire, a fellow teenage parent who Sam definitely has feelings for. Yet no matter what happens, Sam is determined to prove to the world that he's not a stupid teenage guy and that he CAN hang on to Max.<br />Like I said, this is definitely a book that needed to be written and needs to be read. Many of us at some point or another have read the typical \\"pregnant teenage girl\\" novels and they certainly offer valuable perspectives.  Yet it seems that we rarely come into contact with novels that explore a MALE's feelings about the issue. \\"Hanging Onto Max\\" definitely corrects this problem.<br />But \\"Hanging Onto Max\\" is more than just a mediocre novel with a rarely-done perspective- its main character is just as memorable as the content. I literally checked this book out from the library, read the first page, and raced through the novel until I finished it.<br />Sam is just that kind of a character. He is realistically \\"male\\" without being a stereotype, and his thoughts and words reverberate with a piercing, understated truth. Flashbacks of Sam's experiences with his girlfriend and of life \\"before\\" are also unusually well done. Through them, Bechard managed to perfectly capture Sam's previous experiences and thus allow the reader to understand his current situation better. As I read, I felt like Sam was really a person-he is one of those characters you literally feel a \\"warmth\\" and empathy toward. The writing is blunt, quick, and free of pretentious prose. This only makes Sam better.<br />Without a doubt, \\"Hanging Onto Max\\" succeeds at exploring one of the toughest issues. Not only is it from an intriguing male perspective, it deals with the issue of teen pregnancy with realism, empathy, and a fearlessness when it comes to exploring the gut-wrenching choices that those involved must make.it deals with the issue of teen pregnancy with realism, empathy, and a fearlessness when it comes to exploring the gut-wrenching choices that those involved must make.	2004-03-26

As a child, he is treated with almost the same care given to his white half-brothers, yet as he grows up he begins to learn the harshness and injustice of his world. But Paul is determined to make something of himself. He wants his own land, he wants his own destiny, and he wants things that many others of his race wouldn't even dream of.<br />I was shocked with just how much I was impressed with this book! Throughout my life I have loved the powerful stories told in Taylor's \\"Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry\\" trilogy, yet often authors kind of fizzle after a couple of amazing books. But not here!<br />I think one of the best things about Paul-Edward's story is how once again Taylor draws on family stories. Anyone who has read \\"Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry\\" will recall that Paul-Edward is the grandfather of the Logan children, and will find it even more fascinating to read his own story. Which brings me to another point-the fact that Taylor not only draws on family stories, but brings them so vividly and credibly to life makes her writing all the better.<br />And the writing was indeed good. Paul's first-person narrative sounds intelligent and interesting, while still managing to sound realistic and fresh. He is a character full of pride and determination that makes him truly admirable. But the book never feels preachy, and the pride and strength that Taylor fashions into her stories never feels fake.<br />\\"The Land\\" is a book that is at once a story of hope and a realistic portrait of the ugly racism that plagued our society at the time.

Then one of these old friends, Eli Mayhew, comes back into Jo's life. Jo finds that her restlessness increases, and feels how she is becoming dangerously drawn to Eli and distant from her husband. How can she reconcile her past and deal with the complex relationships that surround her?<br />Before anyone pictures a fast-paced thriller, it must be said that this book is anything but the above adjective. Above all, author Sue Miller seems supremely unconcerned with writing anything fast-paced. Her book lingers in its decscriptions and spends much of its time on long and subtle psychological &quot;profiles&quot; of characters. Her first person narrative feels leisurely, and we come to know all of the everyday intricacies of Jo's life.<br />Admittedly, the details become dull at times. It was sometimes tempting to skip a page, look ahead, or &quot;speed read&quot; during a particularly long-winded passage. Due to this fault, I can't give the book five stars. But that's no reason to avoid the book-it still has its admirably strong points.<br />I was first struck by this book's beginning. Miller does an amazing job portraying Jo's quietly disconcerting restlessness with her life. I really did &quot;feel&quot; Jo's thoughts as I read the first chapter. This trend continues throughout the book and it's always apparent that Sue Miller can create the mood she wants. The emotional tones of the book flow almost seamlessly from restless to peacefulness to despair and it is a marvel to &quot;watch&quot; them change so expertly. Also, the dialogue was continually strong. Miller seems to have the gift of making her characters eloquently express feelings that the average person has, yet the characters never sound too phony or lofty. And last, the intricate characterizations and descriptions can get slightly tedious, yet some are beautiful and piercingly insightful.<br />Be patient with this novel. Find a comfy chair on a quiet afternoon and slowly savor each word. Put yourself in the characters' shoes and don't rush. In the end, you'll find that despite a little boredom, this elegantly realistic story about an everyday person was worth it.y strong.

Once a seemingly perfect daughter, she now has to deal with a reality that few other sixteen-year-olds have to. Her unsupportive boyfriend wants her to get an abortion, yet Kia refuses. At times, it seems that her friends have all but disappeared and she only has the support of her loyal youth pastor, Justin. Yet despite the painful times she goes through, Kia learns poweful lessons through her pregnancy.<br />The best thing about \\"Dancing Naked\\" is that within the first pages it plunges you right into the thick of the situation. The prose is clear and straightforward and the subject matter is intelligently explored without being melodramatic. Readers will definitely appreciate the sweet and realistic character of Kia, and her decision not to have an abortion, yet not to condemn others for chosing that option, is uniquely thought-provoking. Futhermore, the way that \\"Dancing Naked\\" alternates between pieces of Kia's journal, her emails to Justin, and third person prose makes for a reading experience that holds your attention.<br />Overall, a solid choice for any teenage girl. Occasionally, I felt the characters to be slightly caricaturized and simplified-the outrageously unsupportive boyfriend and completely flaky friends, for example. However, the other strengths of \\"Dancing Naked\\" all but outweigh this flaw. Readers who are interested in this novel should also investigate Ruth Pennebaker's \\"Don't Think Twice.\\"	2004-03-08

She's finished with highschool, and wonders what the next stage of her life will bring. Always with an interest in medicine, Yanyan is thinking of finding a way to become a doctor. But then she meets the intriguing, charismatic Liang Boashu. He wants her to come away with him and be a part of his dangerous life, but is he more important to Yanyan than medicine? This question takes Yanyan to America, where she is faced with a drastically different life and decisions about where she belongs in it.<br />As stated, this book was typically a pleasant read. The biggest asset this book had was its likeable main character. Yanyan's courage, strength, spunk, and uniqueness just make readers want to root for her. Her excellent personality paves the way for her compelling choices and thoughts-both of which keep the reader just aching to know what happens next. I literally finished \\"An Ocean Apart, A World Away\\" in a day!<br />Yet something small slightly mars this promising read. Despite all of her spirit and sparkle, Yanyan's \\"voice\\" doesn't always sound natural. A bit of dialogue is quite stiff, and at times I had a nagging sense that the novel seemed too \\"simple.\\" This simplicity was a little disappointing, since this book is for a \\"teenage girl\\" audience for which middle-grade straightforwardness was not needed. Yanyan would have been an even better character if her persona was more \\"embellished\\" and she wrestled with decisions a little longer. And, I've got to say it, the last chapter and the final scene were just too rushed!<br />I probably seem nitpicky and cynical, but I truly enjoyed parts of this book. I loved the personality of Yanyan and felt the ideas of the books were appealing and promising. Yet I can't quite give this book a glowing review with its style problems. Read it for a usually satisfying main character, but be prepared for a few flaws.	2004-03-05

In a new country with only her sister to depend on, she discovers that she is pregnant, although she is not married. She knows a terrible secret about the child's real father, and to save face she marries the kind, respectable Joel Hirsch. She does not love him, yet does what she feels is necessary. How will Caroline's legacy of shame affect her family? And what sort of life will she have?<br />Admittedly, I couldn't expect this book to be profound, impossibly high-caliber literature. Yet I definitely expected more than I got. Having never read a Belva Plain novel before, I figured that since she was very famous and the book had oodles of gushing reviews plastered on its cover and inside pages, I could expect a solid, at-least-four-star read.<br />&quot;Legacy of Silence&quot; certainly has some redeeming elements. Perhaps the best thing about this novel is how easy it is to read-it is definitely one of those novels just to grab if you want something that, above all else, keeps the pages turning quickly. Also, somehow the book &quot;works&quot; at least somewhat because it keeps you wanting to know what happens to the characters. Maybe it's just that subsconscious &quot;cheap romance addict&quot; coming out in me! Nonetheless, I felt compelled to know what twists and turns, no matter how cliche, the characters lives took.<br />And speaking of cliche, that's exactly what partly ruined this book. It's almost inexplicable, yet plot twists just seemed too conventional and annoyingly tidy. Furthermore, although I felt this book was readable, I read it in a detached, almost uncaring way-never seeming to really, really care about the characters. It was like, \\"Oh, she's got cancer...on to the next chapter.\\" Also, I was rather disappointed with the ending of this book. Although the overall premise of this ending had potential to be interesting, the characters' reactions to the last \\"revelation\\" seemed muted and rushed. Finally,  I don't know for sure, but this novel may be somewhat historically inaccurate; I don't think Jews could leave Germany at all at the time Caroline and her sister did.<br />Not horrible, yet far from great.

The year is 1917, she is slightly bored following high school graduation, and is desparate to really do something to help her country during WW1. Then she finds her opportunity-the U.S. government wants French-speaking girls to be translators and switchboard operators for Allied troops in Europe. Simone has learned French from her Parisian mother, and quickly \\"enlists\\" for the job. In a whirlwind of events, Simone travels to France, is surrounded by war, makes a best friend, feels hope, anxiety, and pressure like never before, and even falls in love.<br />The best thing about this diary is simply the character of Simone. She sounds intelligent and friendly; her warmth seemed to draw me in as I read. As an \\"average\\" girl, she experienced the war how I think I (and many other girls who read this book) would, and this realism is such a plus in a historical fiction book.<br />Historically, this book is just plain good as well. Before I read this, I had no idea what a \\"hello girl\\" (what Simone's job was nicknamed) even was. This diary certainly changed that, and effortlessly included details about the job as well as the time period that were interesting and fit well into the text.<br />I must say that the end of this book is especially sweet as well-due to its closure of Simone's romantic life and its other conclusions about life and experiences. In conclusion, I feel it's safe to say that most girls will enjoy the \\"friendly\\" main character, little-known history, and cute love story in this diary.	2004-02-03

Caitlin is a brash and free-spirited girl, and when she is twelve, she begins a friendship with quieter, shyer Victoria. Each summer, the girls go to Caitlin's father's house in Martha's Vineyard, and their experiences on these summer travels shape the rest of their lives. Events, often selfish and immature ones, strain the frienship at times, yet no matter what, the bond between the \\"summer sisters\\" endures.<br />After you read that description, you are probably thinking how warm and fuzzy this book would be to read. But it's not. First of all, it's hard to really LIKE the characters. Caitlin, especially, is very, very selfish and never works to improve herself. Yes, she's exciting and spirited, yet the fact that she never grows up and seems to mainly \\"dump\\" on Victoria isn't remotely appealing. Victoria (\\"Vix\\") isn't much better. She just doesn't seem to have any personality. One could say that's she's loyal to Caitlin, but it often seemed that she just didn't have the self-esteem or courage to get out of such a nutty relationship. With its selfishness and strained moments, this \\"frienship\\" seemed more like dysfunction.<br />Also, there was way too much sex in this novel. It's almost deceptive to say that this is a story about friendship; each girl, especially Caitlin, seems unhealthily focused on SEX. And lots of it! I am puzzled as to why Blume chose to portray two girls who so casually had sex with so many people. Yes, I know teenagers and adults DO have sex, yet why focus so much on such twisted sex lives? Especially in the latter half of the novel, a sex scene was in nearly every chapter...not for the sake of making any point, I think, but just to add some supposedly juicy parts.<br />The only thing that remotely redeems this book are the interesting viewpoints from secondary characters present throughout the novel. I kept reading simply because I thought at some point someone would become a mature, interesting, and inspiring character, but unfortunately that never really happened.someone would become a mature, interesting, and inspiring character, but unfortunately that never really happened.	2004-01-26

Born in the 1960's, Cassandra Jane Maxwell didn't have an easy start in life, and that trend of misfortune seemingly continued throughout her childhood, teenage, and early adult years. Her father was a drunk, her mother dead, her grandmother only alive to help for a short time, and her only true friend a nerdy but well-intentioned boy, Joey Divers. After going through a couple of foster homes and feeling isolated from and unloved by everyone, Cass hooks up with the wrong group. She finds a faith in God, but falls in with a group of Christians whose leader, Sky, is not really all he seems. Through the bad times, the moments of happiness, the hippie commune, and the foster homes...take a trip with Cassandra.<br />You just never know until you've read the book. I picked this up at the library, not expecting much beyond a fairly easy and forgettable read. Not quite. Yes, this book is incredibly readable, but it is because it is well-written and engaging. It is written in first person, so it really seems like Cassandra Jane is talking to you. And let me tell you, it's a conversation you never want to end! It's obvious that Carson has a fabulous grasp for her character, and her descriptions never waver. I loved how although Cass got pressured into doing things that were unwise, the reader realized that underneath it all, she was a creative, intelligent, and discerning person who just wanted to be loved and fit in. Her grapples with faith and God are realistic, and the fact that her faith journey is up-and-down and far from perfect makes Cass all the better as a character. Some cynics and literary purists may argue that the ending is too perfect or a little rushed. Maybe it's rushed, but I think that's excusable since I don't have a single complaint about the rest of the book. And too perfect? Readers will have been rooting for Cassandra Jane for so long that they won't mind at all!<br />Unpretetious and beautiful. I read it in a day.	2003-12-31

Meant to be an elegant, thrilling, enthralling story that would span the lives of a family over three generations, &quot;The Thornbirds&quot; begins in in 1915. The Clearys are living a harsh life in New Zealand until their fortunes are changed when a wealthy relative in Australia decides that they are to inherit part of her prosperous farm. When the family travels to Australia, they meet Father Ralph, a stunningly handsome and intriguingly mysterious priest who lives near their farm. Maggie, the only Cleary daughter, falls deeply in love with Father Ralph. He longs to return this love, but as a priest, cannot. This complicated love is the basic theme of the book; the many troubling issues that plague Maggie and the rest of her family are interwoven as well.<br />In some ways, it's ironic that this book just didn't do it for me. &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is one of my favorite books, and to many people, &quot;The Thornbirds&quot; is a similar type of book. Both novels are long-winded, elaborate sagas, each filled what are supposed to be intriguing and unusual characters and grand settings. But most of these criteria are exactly what I felt was wrong wtih &quot;The Thornbirds.&quot; The long descriptions (there was one description simply of Australian wildlife was FOUR pages long) were for the most part ineffective here. Occasionally, when one was to introduce a character, or explain someone's psyche, these long descriptions were necessary. But more often, they were just a pain. I often found myself bored by the profusion of information, and felt that the author was &quot;describing&quot; just because she enjoyed doing it.<br />In addition to simply boring passages, the whole book felt very &quot;uneven.&quot; In &quot;Gone With the Wind,&quot; each chapter seems exciting and the book flies by. In this novel, there were there were entire parts (the book is arranged in sections) that were tiresome descriptions of everyday life. I will say that McCullough describes love scenes superbly, but reading 704 pages for a few fast-paced passages, a couple of interesting psychological revelations, and little bit of hot romance does not seem like a good trade-off.<br />Finally, the characters just don't inspire. To use the same comparison, Scarlett O'Hara of &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is everything a character should. Cliche yet fresh, goddess-like yet human, harsh yet vulnerable, and supremely unpredictable and unconventional, she was always worth reading about. Yet in this book, the characters seem kind of distant. Father Ralph and Maggie don't jump off the pages, they just &quot;stay there.&quot; This might be becuase they aren't very inspiring-they both stay in pretty much the same place (both mentally and physically) and wither with love for each other for their entire lives.<br />I know I'm literally one of millions of people to take this view of &quot;The Thorn Birds,&quot; but it's really what I think.

In this book, Frank McCourt tells of his terrible Irish childhood in the 1930s and 40s, his alcoholic father, depressed mother, and the poverty he lived in. Before I read this book, I heard it described and privately thought, &quot;That's really sad, but do I really want to read another one of 'these' memoirs?&quot;<br />But &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; is not remarkable for the story it tells, but for the way it is told. So many people have stories like McCourt's, only a few can tell them so well. As I read this book, I realized that while the events in it were usually horrible, McCourt didn't attempt to overdramatize them. He simply described them. And described them, I will say, with beauty. His words are filled intelligence, keen observation, and some incredible kind of humor that manages to unforgettably color the experiences and show the fighting spirit that lead McCourt out of his miserable existence. On the other hand, this understated and almost poetic writing style lends itself so well to describing the horrors of the author's life. Because of his wit, determination, and charm, displayed through his writing, we come to care deeply for the author's character, and his misfortunes impact us all the more deeply.<br />Many &quot;prize-winning&quot; books are too strange and artsy to really be appreciated; &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; is just the opposite. A Pulitizer Prize winner, it will capture you with its rare beauty and astonishing power.	2003-12-24

This time, the orphans feel slightly safe in their new \\"home\\" at the eccentric Lucky Smells Lumber Mill for a time, but before you know it, they're facing their enemy again. Surrounded by a creepy and zany cast of characters, the Baudelaires' story continues, and this time it's filled with logs, bubblegum, a mad eye doctor, and a receptionist in disguise...<br />Before I proceed, I must say that you MUST NOT read this book without reading the previous three. I have read the first three in the series, and can say that this one will not make sense if you read it first. But for all those who can't get enough of Snicket, this book is just as good as the previous ones. Yes, it follows generally the same formula, but it's still satisfying with new characters, a new setting, and yet way of discovering and fighting Count Olaf. Snicket includes more \\"vocabulary words\\" throughout the text, and somehow, they continue to add to the story.<br />Before I close, I have one more comment. Snicket and \\"A Series of Unfortunate Events\\" is not for everyone. It must be read with a sense of humor, and an understanding that you shouldn't take everything seriously-it's a MOCK \\"gothic\\" novel. But for those of you who have strange senses of humor, a penchant for tongue-in-cheek wit, and a fondness for unique (and slightly childish) reads occasionally, this series is it. Yes, the seeming gloom and doom of these novels may seem disturbing, but in the smartest, funniest way.	2003-12-19

Virtually until the day the Nazis invade Poland in 1920, her life is filled with ease and happiness. Then, because the family is Jewish, tragedies begin in quick succession. Gerda's older brother is taken away by the Nazis, the three remaining family members (Gerda, her mother, and her father) must give up their home and live in the ghetto, and finally, most tragically of all, Gerda is separated from her parents. Never knowing where they went or even if they are alive, Gerda must spend the next five years of her life in German labor camps.<br />As I read this book, one aspect of it (and this aspect is in many Jewish Holocaust memoirs) continually astounded me. While the events Gerda writes about are totally inhumane and depressing, she somehow manages to find at least the smallest good thing about every experience in the book. She not only remembers the horrors of the camps, she remembers her true friends there and the camaraderie between the women. She not only recounts the tragic leaving of her brother, she writes of the legacy of courage he left her. And when the war is finally over, Gerda's writing tells us of sorrow and loss, yet also of  the exciting and promising life ahead of her. It is, as always, refreshing and inspiring to read such an honest yet optimistic memoir. Written with grace and dignity, \\"All But My Life\\" is a well-done Holcaust memoir.	2003-10-26

Was I ever in for a surprise! Linda Holeman has created a uniquely beautiful novel that deserves to be much more popular than it is.<br />In 1830's England, Emmaline Roke spends her childhood in a a quiet country village. Surrounded by her carefree father Jasper and an idyllic setting, she is shocked when her father dies and her baby brother Tommy's illness harms him tragically. Poverty-stricken without Jasper's money, Emmaline's mother Cat must begin a horrible life of mill work. Then her mother is injured in a mill accident-and the consequences of her accident endager both Cat and Tommy, who is the dearest thing in Emmaline's world. Intelligent, sweet, and determined, Emmaline goes on a quest to rise above her terrible life and save her precious brother.<br />Emmaline's story is wonderfully engaging. Holeman writes with beauty and skill, and her somehow quaint style captures the essence and sweetness of Emmaline and Tommy. While in other books a similar story would be dull, this book is filled with enough characterization, fascinating period detail, and complications that it grabs the reader. Emmaline inspired and impressed me, and I couldn't wait to see what happened to her.<br />My only complaint with the book is that the ending, although it had excellent themes, was that it seemed a little too rushed.

While (as many have commented) the book appears to be little more than a Cinderella story to the casual observer, readers will probably parts of themselves in the reclusive, skeptical Colie and empathize with her. Colie's \\"transformation\\" is not too quick to be believable, and is very inspiring and motivating to the average reader. Furthermore, if you read at all carefully, you will find many pieces of wisdom spoken by secondary characters.

Just last week I read \\"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\\" and found that I enjoyed it quite a bit. Eager to read more, I quickly got my hands on the next book in the series, fearing that it would be somewhat of a letdown...but it was even better!<br />It's their sixteenth summer, and Tibby, Lena, Carmen, and Bridget are off on separate adventures just like before. Closer than sisters, the girls once again divide the magical \\"traveling pants\\" (that fit and flatter everyone) between themselves and live out some of their most defining moments in them. Away from home, eccentric Tibby is off to film camp and must decide what friends and character qualities are really important to her and unpredictable Bee goes to Alabama to visit the grandma who's almost a stranger. Despite their lack of exciting summer plans, gorgeous yet introverted Lena mourns her hasty breakup with Greek boyfriend Kostos and fiercely loyal Carmen must deal with her single mother entering the dating scene again.<br />If anything, the emotions, feelings, thoughts, and personalities of the \\"sisterhood\\" are explored even more deeply and fully in this book. After getting an idea of each girl's character in the first installment of the series, readers will now find themselves epathizing more with each character and finding that they are \\"closer\\" to them than before. I also felt in this book that Ann Brashares did a better job of making each story equally excellent and unique. Tibby's story was powerful and different, Lena's experience was expertly explored and climaxed superbly, Carmen's dilemma was chronicled with compassion and a satisfying ending, and I found Bee's story much more hopeful and uplifting than the last time around. Rest assured that the \\"sisterhood's\\" second summer is in no way inferior to its first...if anything it's filled even more with lessons, life, and love.	2003-08-10

I would venture to say that we don't, and because of our lack of interest and information about the poor, \\"Nickel and Dimed\\" becomes an incredibly important book.<br />Upper-middle-class journalist Barbara Ehrenreich was just like everyone else in her socioeconomic bracket until she undertook the \\"project\\" that made this book possible. Determined to find out what the lives of the \\"working poor\\" were like...Ehrenreich decided to pose as \\"one of them\\" and take various low-paying jobs in three different locations. Then life became hell. While slaving away as a waitress, tirelessly scrubbing as an employee of a maid service, or trapped in the oppressive confines of Wal-Mart, Ehrenreich discovered the numerous problems that plague the working poor. She realized that housing was primitive (to put it nicely), wages never improved, food was grossly unhealthy, insurance was nonexistent, and worst of all, that her rights to dignity, freedom of speech, and being a valued employee vanished. And she found out that as a single \\"poor\\" person, her life was practically easy compared to many of her married or single parent coworkers.<br />All I can say is that this book is amazing. As I was reading it, it was impossible not to realize how excellent (yes, excellent!) my middle-class life was by comparison. Barbara Ehrenreich's truly skillful writing fills the readers mind with unforgettable descriptions of her \\"experiment,\\" and she writes with a powerful sympathy and barely disguised outrage at the dead-end lives of her co-workers. The writing is at times darkly funny as well, and every bit of this masterful writing only heightens the impact of \\"Nickel and Dimed.\\"<br />This book makes you think, makes you feel, makes you angry, and forces your eyes open to darker side of life in America. Ehrenreich clearly wants us to solve this problem of too-low minimum wages and bluntly says in her \\"evaluation\\" at the book's end that action, not guilt, is what readers should be concerned with after reading this book. As an astonishing wakeup call to the woes of minimum wage work in America, \\"Nickel and Dimed\\" is a finely written work with a powerful story to tell.m wages and bluntly says in her \\"evaluation\\" at the book's end that action, not guilt, is what readers should be concerned with after reading this book.

Some of you are probably wondering why I wrote this review and how I had the nerve to criticize a book in which a Holocaust survivor told their story. So first I must say that I am NOT belittling the horrors that Ruth Minsky Sender went through or minimizing her astounding bravery as she faced them, I am critquing the way this book was presented.<br />Picking up right were \\"The Cage\\" left off, \\"To Life\\" chronicles Riva's (Ruth's) life immediately following her liberation from a concentration camp. Horrors still plague Riva, and she finds that the heartache of discovering the deaths of her family member and friends and attempting to rebuild her life is in some ways as horrible as the Holocaust itself. But Riva carries bravely on, marrying fellow survivor Moniek, having children, and wondering what her future holds.<br />The values of hope, courage, bravery, optimism, selflessness, and love shown throughout \\"To Life\\" are totally precious and the finest aspect of this novel. While portraying the intense grief she endured following WW2, Sender also portrays her (and her family's) determination to focus on their new life and make the best of their situation. Although many of the book's settings and happenings are depressing, Sender refuses to make \\"To Life\\" a book without some happiness and much hope for the future. For its portrayal of many excellent ideals, \\"To Life\\" is to be commended.<br />So, as I have said before, I am not attacking the author when I discuss the less-than-perfect aspects of this book. Really, I think the \\"book\\" would have been excellent were it simply shortened somewhat and made into a final \\"section\\" of \\"The Cage.\\" Many of the happenings in \\"To Life\\" were repetitive, and the happenings in the author's life shared through this book would have been even more moving and gripping if they were shortened somewhat; it would have heightened their impact.<br />Hopefully no one takes offense from this review. The events in this book deserve to be shared and heard, and I believe that it is important to relieve what Jews suffered AFTER the Holocaust, I just believe the author's story could have been told in a different and better format.and heard, and I believe that it is important to relieve what Jews suffered AFTER the Holocaust, I just believe the author's story could have been told in a different and better format.	2003-07-27

I'll admit it-since I'm in high school, I'm really quite beyond the \\"9-12\\" age range this book targets. But \\"The Ballad of Lucy Whipple\\" is just such great fun that the \\"9-12\\" categorization should be completely ignored.<br />Twelve-year-old Lucy Whipple is anything but happy. After her father and youngest sister die, Lucy's mother decides to move herself, Lucy, and siblings Butte, Sierra, and Prairie to a strange and savage Lucky Diggins, California that is right in the middle of the Gold Rush. Deprived of her grandparents, stability, books, and cleanliness, Lucy is desperate to return to her Massachusetts hometown and live with her grandparents. But then somehow, she begins to put down roots in Lucky Diggins, and it becomes more of a home to her than she ever thought possible...<br />\\"The Ballad of Lucy Whipple\\" is as faultless of a so-called \\"children's book\\" as you're going to get. Readers will find a lively and interesting heroine in Lucy, and while they may not exactly sympathize with her martyr-like attitude at the book's beginning, they will certainly want to keep reading to find out exactly what happens to Lucy and her family. Humor, tragedy, and everyday life are always attention-keeping in this book; Karen Cushman does a first-rate job of incorporating history into the story-making the historical info seem part of the story rather than simply a boring aspect of the novel. Finally, a well-done and thought-provoking ending cap off Lucy's chronicle.<br />In the same manner of her previous historical fiction (\\"Catherine Called Birdy\\" and \\"The Midwife's Apprentice\\"), Cushman effortlessly writes educational AND entertaining tales of ordinary girls in extraordinary times. This is historical fiction at its best.	2003-07-22

As an almost-valedictorian, a star track runner, and an obsessed chemistry student, it seems certain that she's going to get into MIT-her dream, her aspiration, her goal. But then the letter of rejection comes from MIT, and Kate's life begins to unravel. In the midst of Kate's depression and denial, her neighbor's house burns down (and who would that neighbor be but Teri Litch, who has always been Kate's worst enemy) and the family comes to live with the Malones. Kate has only her father after her mother's long-ago death, but her relationship with him still remains distant during this troubled time in her life. As Kate's life becomes more chaotic that she ever dreamed, how can she reconcile herself to a life without MIT?<br />If nothing else, \\"Catalyst\\" takes a brave stab at delving deeper into a topic that is seldom explored. Many \\"young adult\\" books deal with depressed, addicted, or low-achieving teenagers, yet \\"Catalyst\\" does just the opposite. Lori Halse Anderson begins the books with several well-done chapters showing just how driven, obsessive, and in some ways, dysfunctional Kate really is. Readers can literally feel how much Kate WANTS to go to MIT, and Kate's frayed nerves about being admitted and her subsequent denial over not being accepted are vividly brought to life.<br />But after those first few chapters and Kate's \\"breakdown\\" over the MIT issue, the book loses something. It seems that as we continue reading \\"Catalyst,\\" the Teri Litch situation takes up more and more of the story line, and instead of being a good complication in the story, it merely seems to distract from the issue of Kate resolving her feelings about MIT, college, and failure. I kept wating for Kate to sit down, \\"take stock,\\" and come to grips with her disappointment. But that never happened. Kate and her family are in a whirl of activity concerned with the Litches from the moment their house burns down, and this activity totally cosumes the latter half of the story. The end of the book is too hurried and unrealistic, and does not seem like a satisfactory resolution to all of the problems Kate has faced during the book. Finally, the characters in this book just seemed a little too distant and surreal. I can't totally describe this, but the book seemed a little too dream-like, and Kate's confusion over MIT and then about how to deal with Teri just seemed too distant and detached.<br />In conclusion, it's hard to know what to say. I'd say read this book, simply for the numerous moments of excellent writing and the portrait of a teenager who is the opposite of the many typically seen in \\"young adult\\" novels. But don't expect a novel that stays excellent to the very end and has completely \\"down-to-earth\\" characters.

Raised in Russia, her family has immigrated to America to avoid the persecution they and other Jews in Russia face. But hardships, trials, and changes do not end for the Feldmans once they arrive in the New World. Their adaptations to their new lives and their insistence on holding on to their Jewish ways are vibrantly recorded by Zipporah.<br />This is truly one of the best \\"Dear America\\" books, along with Susan Campbell Bartoletti's \\"A Coal Miner's Bride.\\" Lasky has created an excellent main character; for Zipporah is spunky, courageous, smart, and funny. Zipporah's writings capture the immigration experience for readers, yet her troubles and thoughts are in many ways timeless. Fascinating bits of Jewish culture and history are woven timelessly into the diary, and Zipporah's experience with Yiddish theater is truly enthralling and inspiring. There is never a dull moment in this diary (unlike some others in the series) and the ending and epilogue are both superb. Creatively written, this is definitely a \\"Dear America\\" for your collection.	2003-07-19

Written in first person as if Juan is really telling his story, it is the chronicle of much of Juan's life and and his colorful experiences as apprentice to a master painter.<br />There are many excellent aspects of this book, yet I think that the \\"strength\\" of the character of Juan is the book's biggest asset. Many books that are simply first person narratives are dry and boring, yet one could never complain of boredom while reading \\"I, Juan de Pareja.\\" Juan's intelligence shines through in every page and his intuitiveness fills the book with detail. Also, his struggle to paint (because Spanish slaves at the time were forbidden to practice the arts) is fascinating, suspenseful, and ultimately inspiring. This book would not be a 5-star read without a strong character like Juan.<br />Historical detail also adds great richness to the book. Author de Trevino has captured the mood of 17th century Spain perfectly, and her accounts of Juan's Italian travels fascinate the reader as well. Art facts and descriptions are well-placed, and the reader will find themselves interested in the rich history presented in the book, rather than bored by it.<br />Furthermore, supporting characters are excellent! The portrayal of Diego Velazquez was well-imagined by the author, and the master painter's comments ring with insight and truth. The nobles, the painter's family, the Spanish king, Dutch painter Ruebens...they all come to life in \\"I, Juan de Pareja.\\"<br />Finally, the end of the book is triumphant and fitting. I can't say much more without spoiling the book, but trust me, it's one of the most well-done endings you could find. It is hard to find a single flaw in this book. Vibrant history, excellent characters...why aren't more people reading this book?	2003-07-08

When the news comes that her pilot husband, Jack, and those on board his plane have died in a mysterious crash, Kathryn is numb with shock and disbelief. Comforted only by her grandmother, daughter, and airline investigator Robert Hart, she is totally unaware of the horrible circumstances that surround her husband's death. But as Kathryn tries to find out more about the death of her husband, she cannot help but be pulled deeper and deeper into a mystery that forces her to realize that she never knew her husband at all.<br /> If nothing else, Anita Shreve has penned a compelling and \\"tightly written\\" mystery. Her excellent writing just makes a person want to read one more page, and her revelations of Kathryn's character are fascinating and well timed. She skillfully includes flashbacks that reveal scenes from Jack and Kathryn's former life, filling these flashbacks with subtle clues to Jack's personality and deep insights that enhance the book. Not many other writers could fill a book with virtually nothing but the musings of a grieving woman, but Shreve could. With intelligence and fascinating detail she develops her main character, providing excellent passages of description and knowing exactly how to craft a mystery.<br /> However, I was somehow a little disappointed at the end of this book. Suspense was built so superbly somehow the book's resolution seemed inadequate. The final \\"revelations\\" were somewhat unremarkable, and the book seemed to \\"drift\\" away instead of coming to a strong finish. Furthermore, Jack's motivations for doing what he did were rather unexplained, vague, and unconvincing. Basically, it's a shame that the book didn't finish as faultlessly as it began.<br /> Despite a somewhat weak ending, I'm still giving \\"The Pilot's Wife\\" four stars. Anita Shreve's writing style is superb, her mystery entices even non-mystery lovers like myself, and her main character is fascinating. Best of all, the book serves as an enlightening exploration of the question, \\"How well can you really know anyone?\\"of all, the book serves as an enlightening exploration of the question, \\"How well can you really know anyone?\\"	2003-06-22

World War Two is intensifying, America is devastated following the attack on Pearl Harbor, and the lives of the Hayes sisters are anything but unadventurous. After a brief return to the U.S. to visit her ailing father, Cameron is back to Russia. She attempts to perform her journalism duties with excellence, yet thoughts of her fractured relationship with former boyfriend Alex and doubts about her need for God fill her mind. Blair is desperate to prove to Gary that she is sorry for deceiving him and still loves him, and travels to the dangerously war-torn Philippines with hopes of finding her soldier husband and repairing their relationship. Jackie is still in her native California, very much in love with a Japanese American man yet afraid of what continuing their relationship will mean in the face of anti-Japanese hysteria. On three different continents, handling three explosive situations, each sister must face what lies ahead and maybe even learn to rely on God.<br />My sentiments about &quot;Somewhere a Song&quot; are similar to my feelings about its prequel. Undoubtedly, certain areas of this book were extremely strong. Above all, I loved the parts of this book involving Jackie and Sam (her boyfriend) and found them unique, thought provoking, inspiring, and romantic. Really, all of the \\"romantic\\" parts of the book are well done.  Pella also wrote with skill about Cameron's \\"wrestle\\" with Christianity and did not attempt to solve it simply and quickly.  Furthermore, a few insights into Keagan Hayes's (the girls' father) personality were extremely interesting. Finally, some of the history woven into the story was compelling. Thus, there are certainly some reasons to consider reading \\"Somewhere A Song.\\"<br />However, once again problem areas \\"surface\\" throughout the book. As I suspected, the main focus of this book was Blair. Unfortunately, I found a good deal of the sections about Blair's Philippine adventure flat and unexciting. Blair doesn't have the charisma or intelligence of Cameron, or the sweetness of Jackie, so she herself was not a particularly fascinating character and descriptions of her trek across the Philippines seemed very repetitive. Pella also attempted to describe the horrors faced by Blair's husband as he battled in the jungles of the Philippines; these were in my opinion some of the most boring, confusing, and just plain \\"flat\\" sections of the book. I cannot exactly explain why I disliked much of the \\"Philippines part\\" of the book, it just lacked a certain \\"something.\\" Basically, Blair's domination of the story line was simply unsuccessful.<br />I don't know, I'll probably read Book 3 in this series just because Jackie will be the main character in that book and so far I have loved Jackie. Historical parts of this series just don't seem up to par; and that is a major flaw.

Daughters of a hard and ruthless Los Angeles newspaper tycoon, each girl's life is filled with dilemmas and drama in 1941. Cameron, the oldest, is a stubborn, talented journalist who holds God and anyone else attempting to be a part of her life at arms length. Quitting work at her father's newspaper, she soon gains a \\"dream\\" assignment with a \\"rival\\" paper as a foreign correspondent in Russia. There, she finds action, mystery, the devastation of war...and love. Beautiful \\"middle\\" sister Blair covets a place in Hollywood, yet soon becomes disillusioned with her theatrical and relational experiences there. Indeed, Blair is so desperate to find true love that she resorts to deception. Finally, youngest sister Jackie, a university student, seems to be leading the uncontroversial Christian life that her older sisters lack. However, soon her life becomes more complicated when she begins to form a friendship with a Japanese-American, Sam. In the midst of such change, each sister must determine what is right and how her life is to be lived.<br />Without a doubt, there are a few aspects of this first book in a series that make it memorable. First, readers will undoubtedly enjoy each sister's unique personality, and find such contrasting yet intertwined stories well-developed and interesting. In particular, Cameron's life, personality, and struggles were explored in detail, and her mental strength and intelligence makes her a refreshing change from the often weak-willed heroines of Christian fiction. Secondly, it was appreciated how Pella intelligently incorporates romance in her novel while showing other areas of each character's life, instead of simply making another romance novel. Lastly, some of the history \\"woven\\" into stories of Cameron's European and Russian experience is fascinating and obviously well-researched, and undoubtedly adds a new dimension to the book. Definitely, the book has some solid qualities.<br />However, \\"Written on the Wind\\" could use a few corrections. Above all, it was unfortunate that while some of the history and geography in \\"Written on the Wind\\" was fascinating, some was simply overwhelming and boring. Sometimes it was hard to keep everything straight in Cameron's portions of the book, and it felt like reading a history book instead of historical fiction. Also, I was slightly disappointed that Cameron dominated this book's storyline, and even though I trust that the two remaining sisters will do the same in the coming sequels, I think the book's \\"pace\\" and readability would be improved if time was equally divided between sisters. Unfortunately, not everything was perfect.<br />Overall, this book was worth reading.

Determined to rise above the drudgery and poverty of her upbringing, Margie finds a job at a small business nearby and attempts to escape her overbearing mother and her overworked,disillusioned father. Before long, she meets Frankie Malone, a poor Brooklynite like herself, and the two fall headlong into courtship and marriage. Despite differences between her and Frankie, and some difficulties in her relationship with her parents, Margie still hopes that &quot;tomorrow will be better.&quot;<br />Perhaps more than many of her other books, &quot;Tomorrow Will Be Better&quot; showcases Betty Smith's boundless abilities. Although the synopsis of this book may sound unassuming and dull, with Smith's writing the story becomes rich and eye-opening. Never have I found another author who can take an ordinary life and an ordinary situation (such as Margie's) and fill it with such truth and wisdom so that it becomes powerful. Smith has a rare gift for truly putting herself &quot;in her characters' shoes&quot; and seamlessly weaving their differing stories together to form a believable novel. While &quot;Tomorrow Will Be Better&quot; is ultimately a sad story, its sadness is fitting, realistic, and handled extremely will. This story of optimism, dreams, and disillusionment may not be quite the show-stopping masterpiece that &quot;A Tree Grows In Brooklyn&quot; is, yet it deserves to be read for its excellent characterization and deep truth.	2003-06-13

However, all security is shattered when Kari learns that her university professor husband, Tim, is having an affair with one of his journalism students. Shocked, angry, and heartbroken, Kari decides to go live with her parents while she attempts to sort matters out with Tim, who desperately wants a divorce. Relying on God for strength, Kari is determined to save her marriage. Yet her resolve is threatened and her goal becomes harder when she meets up with former boyfriend Ryan Taylor.<br />In many ways, I enjoyed \\"Redemption\\" and found it to be an insightful look at the devastating effects of adultery. Kingsbury (and Smalley) do a good job of characterization and show many different and compelling views in this novel. However, a few things bothered me as I read \\"Redemption.\\" First of all, once I found out that the counseling center talked about in this book (the one that Tim and Kari went to) was the one that Smalley directed, I felt that was a cheap advertising trick that did not belong in a novel. More importantly, the wrap-up of \\"Redemption\\" made me a little uneasy. It is hard to go into any sort of detail without spoiling the story, yet I felt the ending was quite unrealistic and perhaps not a particularly moral way of resolving the relational issues between Kari, Tim, and Ryan. Since \\"Redemption\\" is overall an interesting book, it's unfortunate that an \\"advertising trick\\" and a poor resolution spoil it a bit.	2003-06-13

Far from it! In this book, Bobbi Brown sweetly and chattily gives teenage girls an overall view on her philosophy of makeup for girls, and gives general ideas of how to use it.

I believe that this book is good reading material for any teenage girl, not neccessarily as a makeup application manual, but simply an encouraging, self-esteem builing book about just being yourself and regarding makeup as FUN, not the FOCUS of life!

At 16, Elisabeth, her mother, and her 18-year-old sister, Helene, travel to the royal palace of Austria in hopes that Helene might gain the the attention and marriage proposal of Emperor Franz Joseph. However, events at the royal palace do not follow this plan. Smitten with her beauty and charm, Franz Joseph quickly falls in love with Elisabeth instead of Helene.

Here, Kathryn Lasky tells her story in a way filled with exotic and fascinating details. Really, the best thing about this diary is simply learning about a princess that is far less familiar to us than royals such as Queen Isabella (Spain)or Princess Anastasia (Russia). Throughout the story, Jahanara emerges as an intelligent, intuitive person, and although someone complained that this book didn't have a \\"central plot,\\" I think I was sufficiently satisfied with just getting a glimpse at Jahanara's character in this diary. Furthermore, it really is fun to learn about Indian customs through this diary. Jahanara describes in detail the lavish court feasts, parades, and living quarter decoration (think diamonds, rubies, and emeralds!). Even more interestingly, she describes how the Indian custom of \\"purdah\\", or constantly shielding women from men's eyes, kept her a prisoner in her own palace. So...interesting character, interesting cultural detail.<br />However, one small tibit of information about this book spoiled a little of my pleasure. According to the School Library Journal's review of this book, some of the characterizations are distorted. Apparently, Jahanara's step-grandmother, who was cast as a cruel, manipulative woman in the book, was not really like that, and Jahanara's father was not as saintly as the author made him appear. Ordinarily, a little bit of inaccuracy wouldn't disturb me in a minor character in a Royal Diary, yet since Jahanara's step-grandmother's treachery formed the backbone of many of the plots in this diary, I found the inaccuracy annoying. To read or not to read? Well, I'd say read, simply to learn about an inspiring young woman who would have made a wonderful ruler of India.	2003-05-03

There are already about a jillion of those for this book. On to the analysis...<br />Actually, I really don't know why I bothered to read this book. I guess I'd heard a lot about how Sparks was a skilled writer whose romance novels were great, and I got it in my head that somehow the book might be better than the movie that followed it.<br />First of all, the writing is flatter than a pancake. The narrative goes on and on unremarkably, and Landon's tone seems devoid of extremely deep emotion at times when the page should be bursting with it.(Spoiler Warning) Once Jamie tells Landon that she has cancer, she declines extremely rapidly and the end of the book seems like an avalanche, as if it simply rushed toward a Hallmark-y conclusion.<br />More importantly, character development and creation was awful. Although the fact that Landon isn't nearly as much of a troublemaker in the book as he was in the movie, and that should have made his relationship with Jamie a little more probable, other &quot;relational faults&quot; and weakness present in the book made it almost worse than the movie. If anything, Jamie is even more impossibly saintly (and therefore grating) in the book. Also, Jamie and Landon never really seem to have a ton of meaningful conversation. Oh, sure, they talk about their future, their goals, and everything along that vein, but it all seems so forced and predictable. Finally, there is just a lack of chemistry between Landon and Jamie. Of course, I realized that this book was hardly going to be a steamy Harlequin, but their relationship seemed so hopelessly...demure. And Landon dribbles on pathetically about how beautiful Jamie's hair looks when it's loose. GIVE ME A BREAK. Bad writing, worse characters!	2003-05-03

Orphaned, he spends his time living under a bridge with his \\"guardian\\" of sorts, Crane-Man, and obtaining scraps of food for a living. Despite the fact that Tree-Ear loves Crane-Man and is extremely loyal to him, Tree-Ear desires to learn the craft of the nearby master potter, Min. Tree-Ear watches Min work on his \\"wheel\\" for many days, yet one day when he cannot see Min at work, Tree-Ear decides to browse in the shed that holds Min's clay pots. After a few minutes of looking at the master's work, Tree-Ear is spotted by Min. In alarm, he drops the pot he is holding. Min commands that Tree Ear work for him for ten days to repay this debt, and after these ten days are finished, Tree-Ear requests that he be allowed to be an apprentice to Min. Although he never gives up hope of being allowed to learn the skills of his master, Tree-Ear becomes more and more discouraged as he finds that Min only allows him to perform the menial tasks involved with pottery. Can Tree-Ear ever win the respect of the potter? Can he somehow convince the king of Korea that his court should be supporting the beautiful, detailed, and superior work of Min instead of that of rival potter Kang? Finally, Tree-Ear decides he must go on a journey himself to prove to the royal Korean court that Min is worthy of their support...yet Tree-Ear knows not what the journey will bring him...<br />Filled with adventure, history, and strong characters, \\"A Single Shard\\" is truly an impeccable work. To begin with, the story is paced perfectly. Author Linda Sue Park definitely knows how much description is enough, and her story flows in a seamless manner not often seen in books. This knowledge of \\"flow\\" and \\"timing\\" also gives the book just enough adventure and great appeal to a younger audience.<br />Character development in \\"A Single Shard\\" is equally expert. Tree-Ear is a wise choice for a main character in such a novel, for although he \\"lives\\" in 12th-century Korea, his thoughts and actions are timeless and universal. Readers will feel with him the excitement of watching Min build a pot, the thrill of gaining an apprenticeship with the master potter, and the hardship he faces on his journey to the palace. Tree-Ear is certainly an inspiring character, yet one who retains a \\"realness\\" that is refreshing. Supporting characters are excellent as well. Crane-Man, Tree-Ear's crippled friend who has been homeless for a large portion of his life, intersperses wonderful wisdom and displays of kindness into the story. Although Min at first seems selfishly cold and nearly cruel, Park interestingly reveals the \\"root\\" of his bitterness as the novel progress. And finally...<br />...The historical side of this book is fabulous. As a teenager, I often do not really learn a lot when reading children's literature, yet I found much fascinating info about the importance and the \\"culture\\" of pottery in Tree-Ear's time. While this may sound extremely boring, it is anything but-for the \\"story\\" of pottery is \\"woven\\" effortlessly into the story in a way that is never complicated.<br />Expert pacing, fine characters, and an intriguingly exotic setting...what are you waiting for? I haven't read many Newberys that appeal to such a wide age range and are so carefully and expertly written!ives\\" in 12th-century Korea, his thoughts and actions are timeless and universal.

The best thing about this book is certainly its &quot;magazine-like&quot; appeal. Its pages are glossy, the print is sharp, the layout is pleasantly modern, and best of all, the short, concise biographies of a widely diversified group of women are fascinating and effortlessly attention-grabbing. Indeed, this book is a godsend for people who ordinarily wouldn't want long, detailed historical books and biographies; &quot;100 Most Important Women of the 20th Century&quot; gives this type of person a glimpse of important history without boring them. And of course, needless to say, hardcore history buffs wouldn't want to be without this book...<br />However, upon closer examination and further reading, a fundamental flaw present in this volume becomes obivious. Put simply, somehow it seems that some women in this book are simply not worthy of being named &quot;most important.&quot; Before I go any further, I think it necessary to say that I understand that it's impossible to satisfy everyone when creating a book like this, but I still feel that selections could have been better. For example, why is Mary Quant included? I know that the mini skirt created quite a stir in the fashion world, but fashion is only so important. Sonja Heine? Revolutionizing the sport of figure skating is can hardly be considered a fundamental accomplishment of the century, at least by my book. Dorothy Parker? Maybe I'm missing something here, but when reading this book, it appeared that she basically drank, smoked, and told witty jokes. Madonna? I won't even go there. I suppose when I think of criteria for inclusion in a book like this, I would only consider truly intelligent women who changed society in a serious, unselfish way and affected large numbers of people. To be fair, I must say that many extremely deserving women also made it into this book-Eleanor Roosevelt, Rosalind Franklin, Rachel Carson, Carrie Chapman Catt, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Mary McLeod Bethune are all women I look up to. The final word? This is an attractive book and an enlightening read, yet a book whose &quot;admittance criteria&quot; seems sketchy and sometimes ineffective. However, if you can refrain from becoming indignant as you are reading if you find that you disagree with the author/editors' choices, you will find yourself enjoying the unique perspectives and opinions found in this book.Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Mary McLeod Bethune are all women I look up to.

Not only have her parents (whom she felt would \\"always\\" stay together) divorced; her once-best-friend father is now journeying out west to complete a university sabbatical (far from their home state of New York) and Sammie is to live with her mother in New York City, as her mother attempts to finish an art degree. Sammie boils with resentment. What's she to do with a mother who's hooked on self-esteem books and in the depths of depression over her divorce? What about her almost friendless, boring existence in NYC? What to do about former \\"best-friend-forever\\", Kitty Lundquist, the popularity queen whose selfishness Sammie is finding more and more annoying, especially since Sammie has now made friends with quirky, loyal, and fun Phoebe? And last, yet far, far from least, what should Sammie do about her growing attraction to her mother best friend's son, the guitar-playing, tree-hugging Eli?<br />OK, good news first. The best thing about this book is that Carolyn Mackler truly does seem to identify with teenagers and create a fairly true-to-life character. With the exception of the discussion about and the actual dealing with boy/boyfriend troubles, I understood what Sammie was going through and found that I identified with many of her experiences. (I don't have a boyfriend; too happy and busy for one, thank you very much :-)). Furthermore, Mackler's humor, infused throughout the character of Sammie, was REALLY funny. For example, how can you not laugh when Sammie refers to her chest as the \\"Grand Tetons\\" and likens her popular friend to a \\"sports car\\" and herself to a \\"Ford Taurus?\\" But despite these solid aspects of \\"Love and Other Four-Letter Words,\\" the was a major problem at the root of the story-it was incredibly cliched. With other \\"I'm-just-an-ordinary-teenager-but-I-can-be-the-heroine-of-a-book\\" stories around (think Louise Rennison's \\"Angus, Thongs, and Full Frontal Snogging,\\" Meg Cabot's \\"The Princess Diaries,\\" and Joan Bauer's \\"Hope Was Here\\"), this book really did just seem like more of the same.

Secure in her intelligence and in the love of her eight siblings and parents, the anti-Semitism that raged in Romania seemed nothing more than an annoyance to Seren and her family. After receiving a full scholarship to attend a prestigious gymnasium (high school) in Bucharest, Seren travels to her country's capital to city to quench her thirst for learning. This dream of gaining knowledge is abruptly ended, however, when Seren throws an inkwell in the face of one of her professors after he makes an anti-Jewish remark. She flees the school, begins work as a seamstress, and enjoys city life. Nazis invade Bucharest and the entire Romanian country; Seren feels that she can take care of herself. Yet soon this feeling of security fades and Seren decides that she must go back to her country home to escape the growing Jewish persecution in the city. Disaster meets her there as well when she and her father are rounded up in a horrifying night raid by the Nazis and sent to a federal prison, where they are falsely accused of being government spies. Seren is released from prison, yet as she receives word that her father is losing his mind, and realizes the destruction of Jewish life around her, she knows that her \\"journey\\" is far from over. Indeed, the pages of her story take us deep into the horrors of Auschwitz, and show us how somehow, Seren \\"rebuilt\\" her tortured life following the war.<br />In many ways, this Holocaust memoir is not extraordinary in its genre. However, in a few key ways, Seren's memoir is supremely effective and unforgettable. First, as I read \\"The Seamstress\\", I was amazed by the utter lack of bitterness in the book. Seren simply TELLS about the beatings, questionings, and other forms of torture she and family endured at the hands of the Nazis, and never tries to \\"play-up\\" a single horror in her life. After the war, it is apparent that Seren simply tries to recover, find her family memebers, and gain a job. She is happy with the husband that she has found, and tirelessly keeps up hope about her life. Wow! I was so amazed and inspired by the fact that Seren never once complained about the havoc the Nazis wreaked on her her life (although that would have been completely justified), and for that reason alone, I would never forget this book. Seren's intense loyalty to her sister, Esther, and friends, Ellen and Lily, in Auschwitz was also uplifting. I was awed by the way Seren insisted that she would be responsible for her friends at Auschwitz, and swore that she would never leave them, even to get food or clothing (which were virtually non-existent at Auschwitz). It seems that this memoir strove to show the high ideals and strong character that were developed in Seren during the Holocaust, and this characteristic of the book alone is enough to make this book a must-read and an inspiration for anyone.recover, find her family memebers, and gain a job.

Since they moved West with their parents and siblings after their mother's health declined, they have seen both of their parents die and now manage the family farmstead and raise their younger siblings (Louise, Derek, and Sara)alone. With the help of God and their kindly neigbors, the Andersons, Angela and Thomas find themselves managing to \\"head\\" their family well. However, now that Angela is getting older, she is finding that Carter Stratton, a young, handsome rancher who recently moved into the Peterson's hometown, seems to bee looking for more than Angela's friendship. How will Angela respond to this? How will she continue to raise her family if she is married? Can she and Thomas continue to raise their \\"family\\" as Derek, Louise, and Sara all seem to be coming to terms with the death of their parents and facing adolescence?<br />...As you read this plot summary, you are probably thinking, \\"What a sad book\\" and \\"What a predictable plot.\\" Well, first, I must say that this book wasn't sad at all. Janette writes in such a positive way and makes all of her characters face trials with faith and dignity. I really love how she shows in her writing that a bad sitiuation (like the death of parents) can be turned into a learning and growing experience. Thomas and Angela (especially) were both inspiring characters who serve as great role models of how a moral, Christian person lives and acts. Yet Janette never gets \\"preachy\\" or fake-sounding with her \\"do good\\" message. It is hard to explain this phenomenon, but as I read this book it seems that it is written so honestly and sincerely that its truths just shine through and you feel encouraged and comforted (instead of preached at). And finally, I must say, yes, as you read this book, you will probably see the ending coming. Usually, I am a sucker for a completely brilliant, surprising ending, but in \\"Roses For Mama,\\" the sweet, simple, \\"quiet\\" ending just seems so right that I can't complain. Janette Oke may not win the Pulitzer Prize any time soon, but I can't find grounds for grumbling about a book as satisfying as \\"Roses for Mama.\\"For Mama,\\" the sweet, simple, \\"quiet\\" ending just seems so right that I can't complain.

Sarah Jane's father was a teacher; yet now that he is dead, Sarah is left with no kin and little money, and the chilren of the town have no teacher. There is enough money that Sarah Jane can stay in the boarding house she is accustomed to for a few months, but after that, where can she go? Miss Kizer, the rather cold and unfeeling woman who runs the boarding house, is ready to send Sarah off to the nearby Orphan Girls' Christian Asylum. However, Sarah Jane is heartsick at the thought of going to an orphanege, where according to her Broken Bow friend Ida, she must lead a dreary, work-filled life. Ida and Sarah Jane brainstorm frantically in hopes of figuring out a way that Sarah Jane can have the money to stay in Broken Bow. One by one, the possibilites are ruled out, and in desparation, Sarah Jane tells members of the school board that she can take her father's place as Broken Bow schoolteacher. After Sarah Jane falsely claims that she's sixteen, the board reluctantly agrees that she can have the position. Up against a primitive schoolhouse, virtually no supplies, and unruly scholars...can Sarah Jane do it?<br />As the title of my review says, this \\"Dear America\\" book does give us a unique view of yet another aspect of pioneer life and gives us a vivid idea of what teaching school was REALLY like in the frontier age. Of course, it was very unrealistic in many ways that Sarah Jane was even allowed to teach (wouldn't anyone investigate to see how old she really was?), but that small flaw didn't diminish my enjoyment of this diary. After all, it was great fun to watch Sarah Jane learn how to teach, see how she coped with all of the challenges, and see her overcome some of the townspeople's negative thoughts toward her. \\"My Face to the Wind\\" is rather dry and boring at the beginning (a little too much info about the chores that Sarah must do and the long, lonely walks that she takes) and her belief that her dead father \\"talked\\" to her seemed to be a bizzare, overdone, and \\"hokey\\" twist to the book...but don't let these minor flaws stop you from enjoying this inspiring diary of a prairie schoolteacher!t do and the long, lonely walks that she takes) and her belief that her dead father \\"talked\\" to her seemed to be a bizzare, overdone, and \\"hokey\\" twist to the book...but don't let these minor flaws stop you from enjoying this inspiring diary of a prairie schoolteacher!	2002-12-26

With her 10-year-old son and the help of Patty Bancroft (director of an agency to help battered women, Fran(who must change her name to Beth Crenshaw)goes to a small Florida town, hoping to escape her husband and begin a better life.<br />The struggle doesn't end when Fran and Robert make it safely to Florida. Fran struggles with a constant fearful knowledge that her husband will eventually get her, she feels homesick for her sister in New York, and she worries that her son is more confused and hurt than he lets on. Things become still more complicated when Fran meets Mike Riordan, Robert's fifth-grade teacher, and begins to desire a relationship with him.<br />Anna Quindlen's skillful writing is what saves this book from being yet another cliched &quot;abused-wife-escapes&quot; book. Yes, the abused wife escapes, but Quindlen describes Fran's experiences with understanding and insight. Her descriptions are some of the best I've ever read-she seems to know exactly how many words are needed to crystallize a situation, and we are taken on &quot;journeys&quot; through Fran's mind that never bore us and leave us with a clear understanding of the character. Cynical, nostalgic, sad, sarcastic-Quindlen deftly writes in all of those tones and creates a truly realistic novel. Characters were again, realistic and well-chosen. The only real flaw in this novel was the fact that between the second last and last chapters, there was too big of an amount of time &quot;gone by,&quot; and as a result, the reader is left with some unanswered questions, a feeling that the author was rushing to end the book, and the thought that the book ended in a slightly &quot;anti-climactic&quot; way. Despite this fault, I found &quot;Black and Blue&quot; to be well-written, enlightening, and worth reading.g, and worth reading.	2002-11-02

After plowing (yes, it was certainly an effort) through \\"Stones from the River\\"'s 525 pages, I can definitely say that these reviewers' words are a far cry from the truth.<br />\\"Stones\\" is the story of Trudi Montag and her German town of Bugdorf. The story takes place from roughly 1915-1945, and chronicles Trudi's growing up, the lives of some of her townspeople, and most importantly, the challenges faced by Trudi and the rest of Bugdorf due to Hitler and WW2. The added \\"twist\\" in this story is the fact that Trudi is a dwarf. somewhat shunned by her townspeople and always feeling the void of her mentally ill mother's death when she was a girl, Trudi is a thoughtful, sometimes interesting, and always insightful character.<br />I know this plot sounds promising, but now is the time for me to point out some major flaws that spoiled \\"Stones from the River.\\" First, there was just a general \\"dullness\\" to this book. Hegi's habit of using run-on sentences frequently and narrating in a \\"rambling\\" style full of boring information did nothing to futher the plot. Not only was the writing \\"flat\\"; it was further ruined by the use of phrases such as \\"dog sh--\\", etc. Needless to say, these phrases add no uniqueness or interest to the descriptions, they simply annoy the reader with the author's lack of writing skills.<br />The plot also suffers because of the general lack of suspense. I was extremely irritated when the text was filled with lines such as, \\"She saw John, who would be dead in 15 years.\\" Okay, now we really are in suspense about John! It is obvious that these \\"futuristic comments\\" shouldn't be revealed early...the reader should be in suspense and SURPRISED when something happens. I kept waiting for some change in Trudi or SOMETHING...but then I was on page 524 1/2 and NOTHING majorly shocking or exciting had happened!<br />Last, and certainly not least, it really bugged me how every character had some major problem. One was gay, one was a glutton, some were unhappy with their marriages, one had a retarded child...and the list goes on! I know that nobody is perfect, but it is slightly unbelievable to have a whole cast of characters that are seriously warped.<br />Trudi isn't a bad main character, and the one GOOD thing she does is show how the average German responded to Hitler and HOW the Holocaust happened, but the many, many flaws in \\"Stones\\" overshadow any good things about this book. If you want an inspiring female character and a fascinating historical setting, look elsewhere!ING majorly shocking or exciting had happened!<br />Last, and certainly not least, it really bugged me how every character had some major problem.

Certainly, &quot;The Proposal&quot; is very similar in theme to Lori's other books, but in my mind it is no different from the other books that everyone else loved. The direction in which the plot is going is totally obvious from the start, but as I said before, isn't that to be expected in a Lori Wick book?<br />A brief plot summary-Jennings, a bachelor in Victorian England, has no intention on ever marrying or having children. However, when he unexpectedly finds himself guardian of his very young cousins Penny, James, and Thomas, all of that changes. Despite his stubborness, he sees his need for help and decides to visit his sister, who has four children of her own. Jennings finally discovers God along the way, and it seems that Marianne Walker, Jennings' sister's lovely neighbor, is taking up a large portion of his mind as well...<br />If nothing else, this book is a great escape from reality. Wouldn't you love a world with sweet, always well-behaved kids and constantly harmonious marriages? With charming neighbors and beautiful country manors and cute comments abounding from the little ones....wouldn't it be lovely? :-) Well, Lori Wick is famous for portraying that kind of world in her books, and if that's what you're looking for, you'll probably relish the first book in this new series.	2002-10-13

I'll spare you a plot summary, and get right to my opinions and thoughts about this book. First of all-I've gotta say it-I was NEVER bored when I was reading this book! Hope was an insightful, witty, intersting, inspiring and just plain fun character that she kept me hooked. Other characters were just as delectable, too-G.T. Stoop, the completely kind and benevolent owner of the restaurant Hope and her aunt work at, who is determined to campaign for mayor despite leukemia; Hope's Aunt Addie, who \\"pulls life's truths from a chicken\\"; and Braverman, the grill man who is \\"almost\\" Hope's boyfriend. I loved watching Hope and her friends campaign tirelessly for G.T. to become mayor-so refreshingly different from yet another \\"girl\\" book about boys, hair, and clothes. I loved finding little treasures of unique and truly funny wit where I least expected to. I loved seeing Hope's optimism and the touching truths about life embedded in the pages of the Newbery Winner. To conclude, I-you guessed it-loved this book!	2002-09-22

And her life continues in this fashion, until it seems that some sort of catastrophe has happened to everyone that Elizabeth cares about.<br />[...] In conclusion-this is a book that I think tries to make a valuable about being a faithful Christian no matter what, but it makes the point in a way that's a little TOO extreme.	2002-09-08

After a fairly \\"same-old, same-old\\" finish to her senior year, Caitlin O'Connor is off to college. Not too excited from the beginning about attending the state college instead of the small Christian ones her best friends are at, Caitlin is dismayed to find other disadvantages about college life. First of all, her room-mate, Liz, is far from ideal and when that's combined with a general lack of friends, Caitlin really feels like a \\"big fish in a little pond.\\"<br />As always, Caitlin's diary is intersting, honest, and insightful. The new characters that we meet along the way add fresh interst to the story, yet Caitlin's old friends make appearances too. Sticking to her \\"non-dating for now\\" commitment is just as tricky as ever, yet Caitlin continues to inspire us with how she deals with dating. This book will keep you reading, and the unexpected event involving Caitlin and Josh will leave you aching for the sequel...<br />The books in the Diary of a Teenage Girl series are great examples of almost-perfect Christian books. Containing a main character we can all identify with and tackling issues that every Christian faces-this diary is a must-read.	2002-09-01

Searingly, brutally honest, \\"Five Chimneys\\" takes us on a journey through Auschwitz that refuses to let us forget the horrors that a generation faced there. Olga Lengyel was a respected woman surgeon in her European home city along with her husband. The Nazi threat hung around them, but Olga and the rest of her family never realized the devastation it would bring to them.<br />Then Olga's husband, Dr. Miklos Lengyel (then a proud hospital surpervisor)is called to be deported by the Nazis. The Nazis tell the families of those awaiting deportataion that they \\"may come\\", too. So Olga, her husband, her two young sons, and her elderly parents board a cattle car, whose then-unknown destination turns out to be Auschwitz. It is there, on a cattle car, where 96 people crowd into a space meant for 8 horses and Olga performs a stomach pumping on a woman who attempts suicide, that Lengyel's \\"6th sense\\" tells her there is worse to come.<br />And there certainly is. Shocked by the naked, starving prisoners, Olga remembers thinking, \\"Who are these women? What crime have they committed...they are abnormal, that is why they are isolated.\\" Knowing nothing of the notorious \\"selection\\" system, she sends her sons to be \\"cared\\" for by her parents, never knowing that the \\"care\\" given by the Nazis was the gas chambers and the crematorium.<br />Surrounded by horror, defeat, despair, humiliation, starvation, and desparate bargains to avoid death, Olga perseveres. She describes her feelings of helplessness working at the camp's hospital, where water is scarce and anesthetic cannot be found, she tells us explicitly of her suffering at the hands of her less-than-human masters, and the utter despair that filled her life...in short what it meant to be a prisoner at Auschwitz.<br />The few slow parts in the autobiography are no excuse not to read this unforgettable account of life in Auschwitz. We must never forget the tragedy and needless deaths of that time, and \\"Five Chimneys\\" certainly proves that point.that point.	2002-08-21

She has what we would call a normal life-living in a nice house, going shopping with her best friend, and having the mistaken feeling that nothing particularly bad is going to happen to her. But then the inevitable comes. Tara has always known that she was a Kurd, and has maybe even faintly known that Kurds are hated by the Iraqi goverment...but one day, when walking home from school, she sees a teenaged Kurdish boy die for his beliefs.<br />Things all happen in short order after that, and the Hawramis, who find themselves dodging the Iraqi government, find themselves living in a remote Kurdish village that is unlike anything they have ever known. The journey continues when the village becomes the target of brutal bombing raids, and it seems that the family must become refugees in order to escape danger. Experiences in two refugee camps follow, and Tara and her family wonder if their life will ever be what it was before.<br />As I said before, I was disappointed with this book. It seems as if the author had a very promising topic and a character that could potentially make the story seem real to readers. But something seems flawed in this book. Laird's writing style is somehow \\"detached\\" and it doesn't really feel like you are \\"right there\\" (which is how it should in a good book). In what should have been some of the most exciting parts of the book, I felt kind of bored and ready to \\"get on with it.\\" Character development seems a little weak, too. We never seemed to really get to know Tara-there was too much time spent telling what she did, not enough time spent telling what she thought.<br />The one great thing about this book is that it lets us know about a conflict, a people, and a time in the not-so-distant past that many of us probably don't know about. I think it's good to read books like this that open our eyes to what's happening around us; it's just too bad that the quality of writing and character development in this book was far from 5-star.nd character development in this book was far from 5-star.	2002-08-17

What if you had to spend all of your teenage years in a Jewish ghetto in Lodz, Poland, or three notorious concentration camp?<br />Well, if you were Ruth Minsky Sender (known in this book as Riva Minska) you would survive and live to tell your story in the form of an autobiography. \\"The Cage\\" is a brilliant book. After beginning with a scene where a grown Riva is remebering her chilhood and talking with her daughter, we are catapulted into her happy world in Poland in 1939. But Riva, her mother, and her five siblings could never guess what their future would hold. Their good (Polish) friends become ardent Nazis, they are forced to wear the yellow star, and the family is doomed to live in the ghetto.<br />In the ghetto, there is cruel punishment, little fuel and food, and the constant threat of being deported to labor camps. And after her mother is deported, Riva (as the oldest) must keep her siblings together. The ghetto is horrific, but as the corageous family hopes for a saviour, they never guessed the horrors that awaited them at Auschwitz.<br />There is something about this book that makes the Holocaust unbearably real. Sender expertly shows how quickly and suddenly the Holocaust took place, and illustrates simply how friends turned on them. I nearly cried when I read about Riva and her brothers in the ghetto-their for each other, their constant hope, and their hardships seemed so read to me. The fragility of life was very apparent when Riva talks aobut the concentration camps, but even then, her mother's saying, \\"As long as there is life, there is hope\\" is remembered.<br />\\"The Cage\\" will make the horrors of the Holocaust known to you...but it will also inspire you with the story of a life lived courageously.	2002-08-12

I was first attracted to this book by its wonderful cover-I just had to know about the character depicted there! Anna Comnena is growing up in the Byzantine empire in the 1000's, and her intelligence and cunning has earned the throne someday. Anna's namesake and grandmother, Anna Dalassena, begins to teach her about the art of ruling and telling her about sometimes-dishonest ways to go about ruling. Under her grandmother's tutelage, Anna becomes more and more like her-hard and deceitful. The already-strained relationship between Anna's mother and grandmother becomes even more strained-Anna's mother wants Anna to be taught about honesty, caring, and justice, not manipulation. However, Anna's keen mind proves to be a threat to her grandmother, so much that she finds that throne might not be her own anymore...<br />\\"Anna of Byzantium\\" isn't totally exciting from the beginning, but if you contiunue reading you'll find that it builds until you just have to keep reading. This book was kind of special, because the inspiring heroine was a real person. Anna's tale is told a little stiffly at times, but characterizations of her mother, grandmother, and father are good, and we really get glimpse at this royal family's strained (to say the least) family life. Also interesting are the subtle references to customs (like veiling, marriage, and wearing purple cloth)that are woven through Anna's narrative. Here is an interesting book with an intelligent, inspiring heroine...get past the slow beginning and you'll be glad you kept reading!	2002-08-10

After years of waiting, Sairy and Tiller, a wonderfully kind couple older couple, adopt them. Florida and Dallas think of running away, but...<br />Need I say more? This book isn't really bad, it's just a little too cutesy and way too predictable. I think a book should take you on journey, make you think, and leave you wondering about some things. From the moment I picked up on all the details of this book's setting, I knew pretty much exactly what was going to happen. Basically, \\"Ruby Holler\\" follows the good ol' \\"happily ever after\\" formula a little too closely.<br />The best things about Sharon Creech's most recent offering are the characters. Florida's constant expression of \\"putrid\\" will always coax a smile from you, and Dallas has some good moments, too. Sairy and Tiller bring a measure of \\"grandparently\\" comfort to the story, and their (especially Sairy's) musings about life and enlightening stories about her experiences are glimmers of Creech at her best. \\"Ruby Holler\\" would no doubt be enjoyed by a middle- to upper-elementary audience, but it certainly isn't the author's best work.	2002-08-09

Kit is, as always, an inspiring female character with admirable convictions and enviable smarts. Although the \\"love\\" side of this book definitely took a back seat to the \\"courtroom\\" aspects of it, I thought that that was understandable and realistic. It is hardly like Kit is going to be searching for Mr. Right and evidence for her case at the same time, and it is made clear throughout the series that Kit feels God leading her to practice law at this time in her life...

I think that if Margaret Mitchell wanted a sequel, she would have written one!!! Therefore, no one else should do what only the author should. Alexandra Ripley couldn't even begin to be totally true to what Mitchell would have done, not only because she WASN'T Mitchell, but because every author wants an original book with characters that they created themselves.<br />This is where the book begins to lose its original charm. Ripley created these new characters, but did the reader want them? She changed the entire setting, but did that make for a worthy sequel? I think the answer to both of these questions is \\"no.\\" \\"Scarlett\\" begins with a scene at Melanie's funeral (how can any sequel to \\"Gone With the Wind\\" be as good without Melanie?), and after chronicling all of Scarlett's social woes in Atlanta, promptly whisks Scarlett off to Charleston in pursuit of Rhett. There Scarlett meets Rhett's mother, sister, brother, and all of the Charleston people, as well as seeking Rhett's mostly elusive attention. A journey to Savannah follows; Scarlett abandons her aunts' and hated grandfather's company in favor of her newly-found Irish relations (her father's family). This sets the scene for the bulk of the novel, for after meeting her Irish kin, Scarlett journeys to Ireland. A \\"quick\\" visit to her family becomes a permanent stay-Scarlett has Rhett's daughter (Cat), buys a manor that was once O'Hara property, and generally builds a new life for herself in Ireland. But she still misses Rhett...<br />As I said, the characters in this story are simply not as memorable as the ones in \\"Gone With the Wind.\\" I can't exactly describe it-they just don't have that \\"special something\\" that makes them fascinating to the reader. Ripley tries to write like Mitchell; sometimes it succeeds, but this novel still has some boring/confusing/needless parts. I don't think the word \\"boring\\" was even in Mitchell's vocabulary! Most of all, I was disappointed by the ending. Too much action, too many happenings all crammed into a few pages-in a book 880 pages long, that shouldn't be the case!<br />On the positive side, it WAS nice to see Scarlett grow up a little. She seemed to mature into a slightly more thoughtful person (but she didn't lose too much of that stubborness!), and her realizations about her mother's imperfections were good insights into her character. Cat was a good character, and it was easy to see why Scarlett loved her so much-another sign of her growing up was that she became a better mother. The Irish setting is interesting in some ways; customs are explored and Scarlett realizes her family history in a satisfying way. And, I have to say it.. the ending accomplished what we were all waiting for.<br />This book isn't terrible; it just doesn't have the magically real characters, compelling setting, and faultless pace of its forerunner.ust don't have that \\"special something\\" that makes them fascinating to the reader.

I noticed this picture book in my younger brother's collection, and was instantly drawn to the startlingly good picture on the book cover. Curious to see who this Molly Bannaky was, I opened the book and began to read her story. WOW!! Molly is truly amazing. She begins life as a milkmaid in 17th century England, and after accidently spilling the milk one day, she is accused of stealing it. Molly escapes the death penalty by being able to read the Bible (law in England at the time), but instead is sent as an indentured servant to America. After seven years of work, she finally claim land of her own. And Molly doesn't stop there-she buys a slave just to free him, marries him, and becomes Benjamin Bannaker's grandmother!<br />The story isn't the only thing that's great here.

Part autobiography, it is easy to see why it has become the classic it is.<br />Sure, the \\"slang\\" is noticeably dated, the writing style is definitely \\"1800's\\", but the characters are what really makes this book great. Louisa May Alcott's chatty, graceful writing style is the epitome of warmth, and it definitely helps the characters to \\"come-alive.\\" Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy themselves are portrayed honestly, and the reader feels just like they are having a visit with the March as they read about Jo's highstrung good nature, Amy's hilarious \\"airs\\" and worries about her \\"un-Grecian\\" nose, Beth's good-as-gold sweetness, and Meg's gentle womanliness. The girls' struggles with poverty are gradually overcome throughout the book, and Marmee (as the girls call their mother) is a timeless beacon of love and lessons for the girls to take refuge in.<br />\\"Little Women\\" is divided into two parts-I find the first to be (generally) slightly more well-written, and the second sometimes to be a little too long-winded and descriptive (the extensive descriptions and place names that chronicle Amy's European adventure are sometimes meaningless and boring to the reader). However, it is worth \\"plowing through\\" some less-than-choice chapters, for the end is pure gold, and the conclusion shows all of the sisters happy with their lives and reinforces the loving bonds of the March family.<br />\\"Little Women\\" is truly a book that will make you laugh and cry. I would suggest that you be at least 12 before you read this alone (I usually don't give age ranges for books, but slight wordiness and some very involved passages are reason for it this time).

She wonders if it's right or wrong, and if the U.S. should be involved. And she wants to DO something about it, but how can she protest, knowing that Patrick is fighting? I enjoyed how this diary was a good balance of thoughts about the war and Molly and her family's everyday life. One thought that really came through was the paradoxical normalcy of Molly's life despite the feeling of \\"living on the edge\\" because of worry about Patrick. Finally, unexpectedly, Molly finds a way to be involved in the Vietnam War when she volunteer at a veteran's hospital. I loved how Molly seemed to really care about the soldiers there, and relate to them well. She felt their pain, and courageously kept volunteering, even if it reminded her of Patrick.

In the start of the this book, Corrie affectionately chronicles her growing up and early adulthood years, showing us her loving family and introducing us the solid foundation of faith that made the next part possible. For soon enough, Germany invades Holland, and the country is plunged into the Second World War. And this is when the life of Corrie, her sister Betsie and their father undergoes a transformation. The ten Boom family has always lived out their beliefs, and now that means defying German laws by hiding Jews and stealing ration cards to feed the Jews. For a while, they stay safe, because of God's protection and their surprisingly large network of fellow \\"resistance\\" workers. Yet finally, the ultimate test comes, and Corrie and her family are sent to a depresing Dutch prison, and ultimately, a concentration camp. \\"The Hiding Place\\" is more than an account of Nazi terror, it is the inspiring story of Corrie's faith. It clearly shows how her faith grew as adversity did. She recalls with seeming fondness God's provision for \\"just the right person\\" to help with the resistance work, and lets us in on her constant prayer life. When prison experiences are described we are inspired by Corrie's love for the Bible and thankfulness in any situation. And at the concentration camp? Once again, Corrie and Betsie band together to minister to the women around them, and still giving thanks in every experience. It is a remarkable memoir, filled with real-life stories of faith and giving an example of how even existence in a concentration camp can be almost joyful.

It is a very worthy sequel to \\"Material World\\", in which women from some of the \\"Material World\\" families are looked at more closely. Perhaps the most special thing about this book is a long, personal, and intimate interview with each women. The women are surprisingly open in responding about their daily life, their children, their marriage, and their future hopes. \\"Women in the Material World\\" simply lets the women speak for themselves, and in the process, breaks down many stereotypes (who would have thought a 58-year Chinese woman would love farming much more than her traditional household duties?)and lets others remain (the secluded life of an Indian woman). Statistics for that country, quick facts about each woman, a brief write-up on conditions for women in each of their countries, and field notes from the photographer further enrich this amazing book.

Grace Hawkins is a Chicago socialite and after finding out that she has to marry an extremely \\"evil\\" (only in books!!) man, she escapes to Alaska where her governess's father is a missionary (wow, what a unique plot-that was sarcasm).

The plot was \\"nothing new\\" at best, and Martin Paxton was ridiculously evil, and... didn't \\"fit.\\" Character development seemed \\"sketchy\\" and illogical-Karen had a few periods of introspection, but Grace (supposedly the main character) we heard nothing from at all. The same goes for Doris, Karen's spinster aunt who joined them on thier journey. But Bill Barringer has numerous periods of introspection about leaving his children in Karen's care while he goes to look for gold...and he says the same things EVERY time! Peter Colton is about as pleasing as fingers scratching a chalk board-his ridiculous ideas about the \\"supremity\\" of men and the \\"weakness\\" of women makes him a character that the reader despises, and I wondered how Grace could like him (let alone LOVE him!) at all. Poorly done book...I expected more from Tracie.

As you probably guessed after reading my review of the first book in the &quot;Russians&quot; series, I grabbed the second one up as quickly as I could...and I certainly wasn't disappointed. The book begins right where the first one left off, and it quickly presents us with new changes and challenges that the chracters are facing. Prince Sergei and Anna's relationship is a major component of this novel-it is talked about more than it was in the first novel. Paul Burenin, Anna's brother, also takes a much bigger part in this novel, and his revolutionary ideas that had begun to take root in the last novel are now the only causes he's living for. I thought the authors did an excellent job of portraying Paul and his conflicting thoughts about sacrifices for the revolutionary cause, and his anguished wonderings about what lengths he will go to as he fights for change. And Katrina's love life takes a few new turns...but I can't really say anymore. All I can say is that, if anything, the history in this book is more masterfully blended into the story than it was in the last book, and anyone who loved the first book in this series MUST read the second!	2002-07-10

She's not anorexic, she's not on drugs, and she's not bulimic. But she cuts herself. Soon she finds herself at a \\"residential treatment facility\\", Sea Pines (or \\"Sick Minds\\", as she calls it) and her hurt shows its face when she refuses to talk. Nothing seems to break the silence coming from Callie, and sometimes she just gets the urge to slice her skin, to see the blood...and it's like she's determined never to talk to her therapist. This book is a masterfully written story chronicling (in detail) the thoughts that whirl around in Callie's mind. It is filled with vivid and poignant emotions, and Patricia McCormick develops her main character well. Callie's relationships with the other girls at the treatment facility add subtle insights about human nature and the universal need of friendship. I enjoyed how Callie's family life and her reasons for \\"cutting\\" were slowly explored and explained in this novel-in a very natural and empathetic way, without being contrite. But the best thing about this book was its hopeful ending that leaves us with the feeling that Callie has emerged from her treatment stronger, wiser, and able to overcome the temptation to cut herself. I hope to see more from this author.	2002-07-07

She didn't try to \\"doctor\\" the events with years of hindsight and thinking. Instead, she wrote \\"No Pretty Pictures\\" with the clarity and simplicity and paradoxical depth of a child's mind. Anita's story begins in Krakow, Poland, where she is born into a middle class home and the future looks to be filled with ease, pleasure, and a good education. However, the Nazis change all that. With their invasion of the city and eventually, all of Poland, Anita and her brother must flee. At first they manange to escape to the Polish countryside with their nanny, and when that fails, they go to the ghetto with Anita's mother. But the inevitable finally happens, and Anita and her brother find themselves confronted with the ultimate evil...a concentration camp. \\"No Pretty Pictures\\" doesn't end there, and goes even further to chronicle the challenges and differences of the war's aftermath. This book is a valuable addition to a Holocaust collection-memoirs really are the best books written about a subject, and Anita's is wonderful. The thing that makes this one stand out from the others is the way experiences are captured with a child's sense of fear and safety, comfort and pain, and good and evil.	2002-07-06

When I came across this book in my church's library a week ago, I wasn't too thrilled with it. Somehow, I ended up checking it out, but my expectations were not high. I expected either a boring, dry chronicle of Russia's history or a sappy, overdone love story. Well...a week later I can assure you that that is definitely not the case. \\"The Crown and the Crucible\\", set in the 1870's, is essentially the story of two families who represent the two basic types of people that were in Russia. There is Anna Burenin, a 17-year-old whose family has always been peasants, and there is 15-year-old Katrina Fedorcenko, whose life has been that of a high-ranking Russian aristocrat. Anna and Katrina's lives become intertwined when Anna goes to the Fedorcenko household to be a kitchen servant, and by a remarkable sequence of events, becomes Katrina's personal maid. But other things are happening as well in this novel. We see how unstable life was in Russia, and read how even Viktor Fedorcenko (Katrina's father) had to guard what he said around the tsar, whom he had known since childhood. Segei Fedorcenko, Katrina's brother, also has problem. It seems that he and Anna are beginning to fall in love...and how could ever be easy since he is an aristocrat and she is a maid? And the brutal war in Turkey over Russian territory only intensify his not-so-loyal thoughts toward the government. \\"The Crown and the Crucible\\" is a magnificently written story that expertly blends history with the lives of people. The characters themselves are wonderful, and I loved seeing the changes and growth in all of them...most notably Anna's Christian influence on Katrina. There is no character who you do not like and begin to know \\"personally\\" and nothing fake about the characterization. There are few books that are so well-written, historically accurate, and filled with characters you can't forget. I'm certainly glad I came across this book! And, of course, I desperately need the sequel now...	2002-07-05

Not only is she torn from her familiar home, she and her mother and sisters are without Lisa's father, who went to America and had them wait in Switzerland until he could send for them. The thing that makes this book memorable are the very believable emotions that Lisa and her family have...saying good-bye to their beloved housekeeper, leaving treasured belongings behind, and living with terrible uncertainty and little money in Switzerland. It is all told though first-person perspective by Lisa, and it brings a \\"personal\\" touch to the Holocaust. \\"Journey To America\\" shows us another heart-wrenching journey to the \\"land of the free\\" far different than the that of Pilgrims.	2002-07-03

Another unique thing is the way events are described-in the form of newspaper articles from that period. Last, but certainly not least, two-page spreads on various issues such as Women's Suffrage, the Spanish Civil War, and Toys of the Fifties go more in-depth with various issues. Altough a well-done book, the utter conciseness of the issues mentioned makes this book slightly \\"juvenile\\" for older readers; still, an enjoyable volume for browsing and some research.	2002-07-02

Unlike other reviewers, I don't find this book to be a chronicle of \\"gloom and doom\\" exclusively-anyone can see that events such as the invention of the car, the era of movie theaters, the 1969 Apollo flight, and the prosperity of the Fifties are covered as well in this book. The thing that I really appreciate about this book is the testimonies of people who really had a part in the events. I found it interesting to read an Indiana man's explanation of the appeal and seeming harmlessness of the Ku Klux Klan, and thought it enlightening to read a German girl's description how Hitler was allowed to \\"go as far\\" as he did in Germany. In between the numerous personal accounts of events are generous portions of factual writing. I think the authors did a great job of thoroughly describing important happenings without moving into too much overwhelming detail. This book really transcends its \\"ages 9-12\\" label-my whole family has enjoyed it and there is something new in it for everyone.	2002-07-02

I would venture to say that many of us don't. Well, here is novel to remedy that situation. \\"Behind The Bedroom Wall\\" is the story of 13-year-old Korinna Rehme. Life is fairly simple for her-follow Hitler, hate the Jews, and turn in \\"traitors\\" to Germany. She loves her Hitler Youth Meetings, and is safe and secure in the fact that she is a \\"loyal\\" German and so are her parents and friends. But then she makes a shocking discovery. What she thought to be the sound of mice behind her bedroom wall is really Jews, who her parents have decided to hide to keep safe. Korinna is outraged, confused, and afraid. How can \\"the enemy\\" be living right next to her? Are her parents evil? What will happen if anyone finds out? Korinna must make the decision-will she turn her parents in to the Nazis or will she take part in her parents' courageous rebellion....??? This book constantly had me asking myself, \\"What would I do in that situation?\\" \\"Would I be strong enough to face persecution and go against a popular view?\\" Korinna is convincing in her utter normalcy and frightens us into thinking, \\"Could that be me?\\" The novel is also suspenseful as we realize that danger faces Korinna no matter which way she chooses. \\"Behind The Bedroom Wall\\" is a must-read for any kid (adults might enjoy it, too)and really, really shows us how Hitler succeeded in carrying out the Holocaust.	2002-07-01

Well, guess what? I could. This short novel is the story of little-known Old Testament woman Tamar. She is forced against her will, at 14, to marry Er, the cruel son of Judah (who is Jacob's son and Joseph's brother). After months of cruelty at his hands, he dies, leaving Tamar a childless widow with no alternative but to follow tradition and marry his brother, Onan. She soon finds out that he is just as cruel as Er...and what can she do after Onan mysteriously dies? Bathshua, her bitter mother-in-law, calls her a witch and orders her husband to send Tamar away. When Tamar returns in disgrace to her father's house, with no hope of having a child (the main goal of a woman's life during Bible times), she at last plots a desparate scheme to give Judah descendants and her own life purpose...One thing I DID enjoy about this book was Tamar's patience, courage, dignity, and intelligence. She definitely had depth to her character that makes her more inspiring to read about than many of the &quot;heroines&quot; in contemporary stories. However, Tamar's character alone isn't enough to make this novel a winner. First of all, the novel is very short, quick and to-the-point. There needs to be &quot;something more&quot; to really turn it into a STORY and just an extended Bible passage. Also, Francine's other books really show her gift of crafting intriguing characters and settings which all culminate to a suspenseful climax...this book had the sound BIBLICAL aspects of her other books, but not the superb LITERARY techniques. &quot;Unveiled&quot; is one of those books that isn't bad by itself, but when you compare it to the author's other fabulous works, its weaknesses really show. If you want to learn about this inspiring Biblical woman, I'd suggest getting this so-so book from the library instead of buying it.getting this so-so book from the library instead of buying it.	2002-06-29

If you really enjoyed the the suspense, surprise, and zaniness of Sharon Creech's \\"Walk Two Moons\\" or if the humor-filled \\"Absolutely Normal Chaos\\", \\"The Wanderer\\" will probably disappoint you. \\"The Wanderer\\" is the story of Sophie, an adopted thirteen-year-old who loves the magic and mystery of the sea. The chance of a lifetime comes when Sophie begins a journey with her \\"new\\" cousins and uncles across the Atlantic to visit \\"Bompie\\" (Sophie's \\"new\\" grandparent). The book takes the form of two journals, Sophie's and Cody's (one of Sophie's cousins) and is filled with description of sea life and work. I think one of the major flaws in this book is the fact that it doesn't really have a \\"plot\\"...yes, I know, fans of this book will probably say that made it more realistic, since real life doesn't have a plot, either! But still, this book had many dull moments and parts filled with \\"boat language\\" that doesn't really interest the reader. In short, it failed to draw me in. Another point-although I liked Cody and found his character and his journal interesting, I don't think many 13-or 14-year old boys would write in such a descriptive and insightful way, and so that made his journal a little less enjoyable. The main things that partly redeem this rather \\"sparse\\" and \\"dry\\" book are the occasional humorous moments and touchingly true sentiments about life and other things. Also, there are some interesting character changes and growths along the way and especially at the end. I can't say I highly recommend this book. If this was a new author, I might say this book showed potential, but since Sharon Creech's other books are better than this one (at least in my opinion), I wonder what's next for this author. I'll be curious to see what her next book is like.	2002-06-27

She's an outcast of sorts at her highschool, her five-year-old brother, Charles Wallace, is a genius, and worst of all, her scientist father is gone on what seems to be a dangerous and mysterious mission in space. But help for her father comes in a very unlikely way. Charles Wallace meets three mysterious \\"witches\\" (Mrs. Who, Mrs. Which, and Mrs. Whatsit) who soon have Meg, Charles Wallace, and Calvin O'Keefe (a newly-found friend of Meg's) journeying through space on a treacherous quest to save her Mr. Murry. After stopping for rest on a breathtakingly beautiful planet during their travels through the galaxy, Meg, Calvin, and Charles Wallace find themselves on Camazotz, a planet that has succumbed to the \\"Dark Thing\\" (evil). And their quest for Mr. Murry becomes increasingly difficult as they realize the incredible evil they are fighting...\\"A Wrinkle in Time\\" is definitely the best fantasy book I have ever read. Madeleine L'Engle's sheer imagination is unrivaled, and her descriptions of the various planets the characters travel to are wonderfully...well, descriptive!...and it really seems like L'Engle's been there. But this book is more than just a meaningless yet prettily written fantasy. L'Engle's unique and moving thoughts on good and evil, as well as our responsibility towards fighting evil are readily apparent in this book. Some very profound things are said, and some very profound concepts are embedded where you'd least expect them to be in this novel. For a treat for your imagination and food for thought, just read \\"A Wrinkle In Time\\"!	2002-06-26

These are the questions that Anna Duncan faces after a terrible car accident takes away her body's health and her ability to play karate. \\"Peeling The Onion\\" is a very honest book. We see snatches (in italicized letters) of Anna's thoughts and feelings and reactions, and the author particuarly focuses on how Anna's life changes. One thing I especially liked about his book was how the author didn't always try to make Anna this upbeat, happy role model of a character and really created someone like us. It is very apparent how agonizing and painful Anna's recovery (not even a total recovery) was, and how difficult it is to have part of your identity stripped away. The suffering and painful soul-searching only make the hopeful ending even better...and finally, we see (as Anna does) that \\"peeling the onion....even though it makes you cry\\" is sometimes the only way to discover yourself.	2002-06-24

She visits a museum exhibit dealing with ancient Egypt, sure that Time will let her be with Strat. But in the present day, she meets a boy who claims to be a great-great nephew of Strat's...and when Time finally takes her away, she finds herself in ancient Egypt, amid more danger than she thought possible...Caroline Cooney's writing is perfect for this book-brisk enough to keep the reader's interest yet include precise, effective descriptions. The story is told from the viewpoint of many different characters, making it a multi-dimensional novel. I loved reading about ancient Egypt...it made the book very exotic and Annie's reactions to a dramatically different culture were realisitic and at times, entertaining. This book will keep your attention as you \\"journey\\" through Egypt and wonder when (and if) Strat and Annie will meet, and if Annie will ever survive the danger in ancient Egypt.	2002-06-23

It all comes to a head when Luke is mysteriously murdered and Michelle's mother, who is innocent, is the prime suspect. \\"Evil Encounter\\" is kind of an unsual book-we don't often see books that deal with these kind of issues. It really was a pageturner (as the title of my review says) and it never lacked excitement or drama. I always \\"just had\\" to read one more page. However, as the reviewer from Booklist said, there were a lot of subplots and other issues that should have either been explored more or simply left out (which would have made the book focues more on Michelle and Luke's relationship). Also, I thought Michelle could have been a little more \\"developed\\" as a character. I like it when books have sections that simply let you see the thoughts of the character, without only TELLING what they do. \\"Evil Encounter\\", despite these few flaws, is still a very exciting, unique, and thought-provoking book.	2002-06-20

When she arrives at her father's ranch, she meets his foreman, Travis, who she quickly falls in love with. When Rebecca's father Andrew is on his deathbed, he asks Travis to marry Rebecca, since he wants to know that Rebecca is protected and loved. After their less-than-normal marriage, Rebecca runs away since she mistakenly believes that Travis married her just to gain her father's ranch. Years later, under dramatically different circumstances, Rebecca returns. Travis still loves her, but Rebecca must decide whether or not her hesitance to be loved and her disagreement with Travis' newfound faith in Christ will stand in the way of his love. If you like Lori Wick you will probably like this story. There were definitely some good things about it. First, I really liked how it wasn't a perfect, predictable romance. The obstacles that were faced throughout the book made the hopeful (but not perfect) ending all the better. I guess you could say this is one of Lori's more realistic romances. It was also neat to see the changes in Travis when he accepted Christ, and I enjoyed &quot;meeting up&quot; with characters from the previous book in this series. Two stars were deducted for two reasons. First, Lori's writing and descriptions need some work since they sound unnatural and &quot;hokey&quot; sometimes. Second, the story had some &quot;slow&quot; parts when Rebecca wasn't living with Travis and focused on some romances that really didn't interest the reader during that time as well. Still, anyone who enjoys a sweet, cutesy Christian romance will enjoy &quot;Whispers of Moonlight.&quot;	2002-06-18

It is a perfect read in the summer-nearly 1000 pages to keep you reading throughout those long, lazy days. &quot;Scarlett O'Hara was not beautiful, but men seldom realized it&quot;...from the first lines of the book we are enchanted. And the passionate, emotional story of Scarlett O'Hara is the story of a how a war changed Scarlett's life, the story of how a pampered Southern belle became a woman changed by terrible circumstances. It is a love story, a story of one person, and story of Civil War-era South.<br />  There are a couple of key things that make this book the classic that it is. First, Margaret Mitchell really is one of those &quot;born&quot; storytellers. She is wonderful with description, and makes us &quot;feel&quot; things, yet seems to know exactly how much description is too much or too little. She effortlessly creates a seamless story taking place over many years, with never a dull moment on any one of the 954 pages. That alone is enough to make a novel &quot;stand out&quot;.<br />  &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is also filled with vibrant characters. Margaret Mitchell's effective descriptions and keen insights into the minds of each character make this book even better. There is Scarlett, whose stubborn streak, determined mind, and desperate love we see and identify with; there is Melanie, sweet, trusting, and fiercely loyal (she happens to be my favorite character); there is Rhett, the puzzling, reckless, and mysterious blockader who is much like Scarlett; and there is Ashley, the one love that Scarlett cannot have.<br />  The only thing about this book that ISN'T absolutely perfect is the racism. Like many Southerners at that time, Margaret Mitchell had a very biased opinion of black people and their place in society. It was disturbing to read descriptions such as &quot;their monkey-like faces&quot; and &quot;darkies need to be treated like children&quot; in this book. However, I think this was in the book because that was how it WAS in the South then, not necessarily because the author thought it SHOULD BE that way. Racism is certainly wrong, but that was a part of the Southern way of life before, during, and after the Civil War.<br />  &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is a wonderfully captivating book filled with characters that we can all identify with.

They have done what no &quot;You should be grateful...&quot; or &quot;Think of those people in other countries...&quot; could have done...they have made the world real to us.	2002-06-13

And \\"Rollo\\", \\"Brigg\\" and \\"Candy\\" are just ordinary highschool guys. Until the day that the guys decide that Valerie's a little annoying and that they might have some \\"harmless\\" fun teasing her. But the guys don't know how one thoughtless moment can change their lives, and Valerie could never know how her sense of security and optimism could be altered in the blink of an eye. This novel about sexual assualt is well-written, thought-provoking, and hard-hitting. Norma Fox Mazer keeps it suspenseful and realistic and knows just how to develop the characters. It is written in a way that makes you realize that sexual assault isn't a simple issue and we are challenged to think of the the boys as \\"normal\\", not just as monsters. In particular, \\"Rollo\\" is shown to have just \\"jumped on the bandwagon\\" and lived to regret his actions. Valerie is also portrayed well...struggling with humiliation, anger, and shame. Minor characters also add interesting and contrasting viewpoints and perspectives. To close...a well-done book on a difficult subject. Any teen should read this.	2002-06-04

On the positive side, I greatly enjoyed Victoria's witty, \\"British\\" sense of humor and found her diary quite interesting in the start. Victoria was also portrayed (for the most part) in a straight-forward, honest way that readers can relate to. Now for the cons...this sounds trivial, but sometimes there were so many lords and ladies and advisors and other characters that it got kind of confusing and we were \\"lost\\" in the details. It was also unfortunate that the diary seemed to \\"lose steam\\" midway through and Victoria wasn't nearly as witty and \\"fresh\\" as before...this was also about the time when the characters began to get a little confusing. Constant references to \\"Certain Persons\\" were a little mystifying. Last, but not least, would a 9-11 year-old really write this way (I wondered this when I read the diary of 11-year old Mary, Queen of Scots in the Royal Diary Series, too)? This is one of those rare Royal Diary books that you might want to buy just because it will make your collection complete, not because it's a great book.	2002-05-31

It seems to be &quot;deeper&quot; than the rest. It is the story of the Fontaine family and Clayton Taggart, set in the 1870's in Colorado. &quot;Where The Wild Rose Blooms&quot; focuses on the romance between Clayton and Jackie, one of the Fontaine girls. I particularly liked the characters in this book. They were certainly not perfect (especially Jackie) and seemed much more believable in their flaws than some of Lori's other characters. Because of the &quot;believability&quot; and development of her characters, we really enjoyed the romance a lot more and felt very rewarded when it happened-even though we knew it was coming. This is a nice, fun, and sometimes thought-provoking read that you'll enjoy.	2002-05-31

But I'm glad I kept reading, since I ended up enjoying this diary very much. Kathryn Lasky has really brought Mary to life and has set the diary at an interesting point in Mary's life-when she is a young girl growing up in the French court to prepare for marriage to the French prince, Francis. I learned many new things about Mary without feeling like I was reading a history book-I never knew that she enjoyed horseback riding and hawking and liked learning about her companions-the \\"four Marys\\". I have only one complaint about this book; eleven-year-old Mary sounds a little too grown-up when she is writing in this journal. Still, this book will certainly please loyal fans of the Royal Diary series.	2002-05-27

When Kira's mother dies, she is left to fend for herself, alone in a community of hostile people who wouldn't miss her if she died. Yet Kira survives when the Council of Elders (who control the village) spares her because of her remarkable weaving talent...and Kira has no idea how her life is about to change. I love many things about this book. First, I'm amazed at how \\"personal\\" this piece of futuristic fiction is. Lois Lowry has created a deeply moving character startlingly similar to us...so different from the \\"otherwordly\\" creatures of most futuristic and science fiction novels. The portrayal of Kira's talent was perfect, and I could feel her connection to the cloth and the power of creativity flowing through her, and this book's subtle message that \\"forced\\" talent loses some of its creativity and joy was very powerful. Last, but certainly not least, the mystery and sunspense in this book was wonderful. I was constantly wondering about Kira's unanswered questions and wanted to discover the sinister mystery surrounding the village and Kira's father's untimely death. There really is something for everyone in this masterpiece of a book.	2002-05-26

Finally, just what Christian fiction needed...a fresh time period (no more Christian \\"Westerns\\"), an intriguing story, and a REAL woman!!! Wow...what a rare combination. In 1903, Kit Shannon decides to move to Los Angeles, the one place she figures she might have a chance at living her dream of being a lawyer. Things are harder than she ever imagined...her Aunt Fredrica worries that Kit's less-than-conventional career will ruin her social life in the city, and Kit's having trouble finding an employer. But worst of all, she's suddenly forced to help in a murder trial...a trial where a man who has become a friend of hers seems guilty of murder. From the beginning of this book, I was inspired by Kit's deep faith in God and strong personality. I loved how she wasn't sickeningly perfect and was a real person we could all relate to and be inspired by. It was also wonderful that this was a Christian book about something OTHER than a woman finding \\"Mr. Right\\" and really showed a woman making a difference and NOT just being \\"in love.\\" Last, but certainly not least, I appreciated how you could enjoy this book without knowing much about court proceedings. This well written book with a strong main character is a must-read!	2002-05-22

Some are really cute... but others, like this one, are absolutely sickening. Everything about this book was wrong. First, it was obviously edited badly because it doesn't take a brain surgeon to realize that there were many, many missed commas in obvious places. Also, this book seems a little contrived-like, haven't we read the \\"girl goes out West and meets perfect man\\" a few times before in a Lori Wick book? Some realistic characters that we can all relate to would be nice, too. I mean, unlike Kaitlin, I am not always perfectly sweet, demure, calm and composed-and it seemed like everyone else in this book was just a great person also (a.k.a. Rigg). Frankly, it made me want to GAG most of the time. It got really boring to hear more of each characters' perfect thoughts. To sum it up...a very poorly written, contrived book with perfectly \\"puppet-like\\" characters and bad editing. Can't Lori do better than this?????	2002-05-22

When someone gave me this book as a sort of gift, I was kind of reluctant to read it. I mean, it looked like another one of those thick, boring biography collections that line the bookshelves in your social studies classroom. Was I ever wrong...I started reading this book, thinking I'd just read for a few minutes, and soon half an hour had gone by. Phillip Hoose has done a wonderful job of creating a book with dynamic young people throughout history that inspire us all. And he goes beyond telling about Phillis Wheatley...he tells about Anna Meyer, who played professional baseball during World War 2, John Tinker who boldly stood up for his rights to protest the Vietnam War, and the boys who played a crucial-yet-rarely-realized role as part of the crew on Columbus's voyage. So you think history's boring? Read this book and see it in a whole new light!	2002-05-18

Once again, we see the era through the eyes of a fairly normal girl, yet we glean a rich knowledge of the time when we read this diary. Kat was well characterized in her diary, and Katherine Lasky once again writes an interesting story and lets us see how the suffrage movement really was. It's hard to explain...but somehow this book just wasn't one of my favorite \\"Dear Americas\\". It just didn't totally \\"grab\\" me and I just didn't totally LOVE it...like I did with \\"Dreams In The Golden Country\\" and \\"A Coal Miner's Bride\\" (other \\"Dear Americas\\" that every human alive should read!!!!).

I have read one book in the \\"Christy Miller\\" series (enough to know the gist of the series) and I've really enjoyed \\"Until Tomorrow\\"...but \\"As You Wish\\" is definitely the best yet. I am usually not one to enjoy \\"teen\\" romances as much as I did this one, but \\"As You Wish\\" is definitely a special book. Robin Jones Gunn fills this book with realistic life experiences that we can all relate to and creates the sweetest relationship between Todd and Christy...but the book is so much more than that. Gunn does a wonderful job of illustrating the importance of having God in the center of our relationship and the joy and the peace that follow giving our life to him. It's awesome how this book flawlessly combines a growing romance and a growing faith in God. If you're a teen girl wanting a good read and/or lessons on relationships, run to the nearest bookstore and grab the \\"Christy and Todd-The College Years\\" series.	2002-05-11

She's always known that her grandmother escaped the Nazis, yet why, 60 years later, does she call out for \\"Tatianna\\" as she lies in delirium? And why does she want Darby to travel to Austria to \\"give Tatianna her name back\\"? And so the story begins...part mystery, part historical fiction, and with a hint of romance...yet mostly a hauntingly real and at times strikingly beautiful story. It will keep you on the edge of your seat as you wonder what will happen next, it will make the Holocaust real to you, and you will feel as if you are in Austria...yet mostly it will teach you about love and finding yourself through Darby's own journey. Another thing I really appreciated about this book was the fact that it was a wonderful Christian book WITHOUT having a basic plot of \\"Desperate woman meets perfect handsome Christian man\\". Cindy McCormick Martinusen has certainly proved her talent in writing with this one-of-a-kind book. A few descriptive passages were a little \\"long-winded\\", but for an author's first book, it is great. I'll look forward to seeing what Cindy McCormick Martinusen will write in the future.	2002-05-01

The reason for that is because it is seriously one of the most, if not THE most boring book I have ever read! It seemed promising at first, and I thought it would be an interesting look at medieval life and an arranged marriage relationship between the two main characters, Elenor and Thomas. WRONG!!!! It quickly backslid into the most slow-moving book when Elenor and Thomas began their journey on a pilgrimage. The writing style is very unnaturally choppy-one thing that really hurts this book is the fact that there is virtually no conversation between Elenor and Thomas during their journey-I realize that they may not want to be around each other much, yet still I think such close proximity would \\"force\\" them to converse beyond monosyllables! This book also has absolutely no action. \\"The Ramsay Scallop\\" just seems to drag on forever, and you never seem to feel a lot of interest in the characters or that delightful feeling of suspense that just comes naturally when you are reading a good book. Since I'm reading this book in a school novel study, I guess I'll have to finish it-but I certainly don't have much hope in this book being a \\"winner.\\" So, you've been warned-the side effects of reading this book might include depression (just thinking about finishing it saddens you), drowsiness (as I said it has no action whatsoever), and violent feelings (against the book, the teacher that made you read it, etc.). My advice? Skip this bore of a book and choose one of Karen Cushman's more lively accounts of life in the Middle Ages.	2002-04-26

Caitlin is a great main character-as always-and you will enjoy hearing about her senior year in highschool-a time of thinking about prejudice, making new friends, and thinking (as always) about the boundaries and definitions of dating.<br />  \\"Who I Am\\" is certainly a worthy sequel-just a LITTLE dull since we are just hearing about the last part of Caitlin's senior year.

Shunned by her cruel father and cold mother, twelve-year-old Patty daydreams of what it would be like to be loved by someone.<br />  It just so happens that Patty's small town of Jenkinsville becomes the site of a POW camp for German soldiers. One day, the prisoners are led into her father's department store by soldiers to buy hats. Patty, who is working there at the time, has her first encounter with Frederick Anton Reiker, who from the first meeting strikes her as being different.<br />  In a remarkable twist of fate, Anton escapes from the prison and has to hide at Patty's house in their \\"abandoned\\" attic. There, the friendship only grows stronger-in Anton, Patty finds acceptance and love-all the things she has missed from her family. But inevitably, the time comes for her family to find out about the secret she has been hiding...<br />  Bette Greene has done a wonderful job of making this a passionate and thoughtful book. Her portrayl of Anton shows us the other side of Germans during World War 2-is it possible that some really were just decent people unfortunately pulled into the cruelty of Hitler's Germany? We contemplate with Patty the risk she takes-is it worth it to undoubtedly \\"lose\\" her family and whatever friends she still has for a lonely German soldier? And maybe, we wonder with Patty, are some things more important than patriotism?<br />  The only flaw in this book was the relationship between Patty and Anton. It seemed to me like it was a little too \\"romantic\\" for a relationship between a 12-year old and a 22-year old. I think the story would have been more realistic Patty was a bit older and/or Anton was younger. Thankfully, Bette Greene still created a wonderful story of frienship despite this flaw, and it is still a book DEFINITELY worth reading.	2002-04-14

Narrated by a boy, Jim, it chronicles his experiences of life on the early American prairie, and his friendship with a fascinating Bohemian immigrant girl, Antonia Shimerda. It is one of those unique books that is not controlled by a plot-it is a collection of Jim's memories and thoughts of Antonia, from his earliest remembrances to his thoughts as an adult.

It is like we can never fully get used to the unhumane crimes committed in that terrible time, no matter how much we read...and \\"I Have Lived a Thousand Years\\" is no exception to that rule. By \\"literary\\" definitions, it probably be considered a rather unremarkable novel, but its searing story alone makes it a worthwhile read. Somehow, Elli's simple, stark descriptions only serve to heighten the effect of this book, for as I was reading it, I mourned with Elli at the loss of her childhood home, rejoiced with her as she and her mother somehow survived, and literally cried with her as she realized the tragic fate of children in the concentration camps. This memoir serves as a reminder of Auschwitz, of the cattle car rides, of the Holocaust-and of an innocent childhood voice telling a horrific story that must never be forgotten.	2002-04-01

It is one of those books that I couldn't put down...literally...once i started reading, so i just decided to curl up with it and give up trying to do anything else until I finished reading it. This diary-form story begins in Poland, where thirteen-year old Anetka lives with her grandmother and brother. We get a glimpse of Anetka's daily life on her grandmother's farm before the life-changing moment comes-Anetka receives a letter from her father, who left for America some years ago, telling her and her brother that they should leave Poland and join him in the coal town of Lattimer, Pennsylvania. The news gets even worse when he informs Anetka in his letter that she is to be a \\"mail-order\\" bride, and marry a coal miner whom she has never seen in her life. I'd love to say more, but I'll give away the story if I do. It is suffice to say that Anetka discovers first-hand the horrors of the coal miner's life and the hardships of being a mail-order bride. Susan Campbell Bartoletti has written this book perfectly, showing the incredible hardship of Anetka's life, yet putting a spark of hope in the book the whole way through. It is a wonderful read, and you don't want to miss this believable \\"diary\\" with a strong main character at its center.	2002-03-28
