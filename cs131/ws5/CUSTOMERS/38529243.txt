Add this to the list of maritime disaster books that are springing up.  As this book doesn't go into as much detail about the whaling industry as several of the others, it is a very quick read (a rainy weekend should do it).  Of interest were the sections on beachcombers and runaway slaves.<br /><br />It is well written and is a page turner.  Most of the material comes from 2 \\"long lost\\" journals written by 2 members of the crew.  Unfortunately they did not witness the actual murder so there is some question as to what actually happened.<br /><br />This is an enjoyable read (that you can actually get at your local B&N for $4.98 right now (hardcover even))..  If you like this you might also try:<br /><br />Moby Dick (the book almost all of these other \\"non-fictional\\" books reference.<br /><br />Neil Hanson's Custom of the Sea<br /><br />Gregory Gibson's Demon of the Water<br /><br />Glyn Williams' The Prize of All the Oceans (my favorite of the group)<br /><br />Mike Dash's Batavia's Graveyard<br /><br />Caroline Alexander's The Bounty<br /><br />Sir John Barrow's Mutiny<br /><br />Nathanial Philbrick's In the Heart of Sea<br /><br />Davis Shaw's The Sea Shall Embrace Them<br /><br />Sebastian Junger's The Perfect Storm<br /><br />Doug Stanton's In Harm's Way	2005-09-14

Don't get me wrong, this is an incredible Memoir, but the edition that you want is the one by the Library of America.  Yes you will pay a little more, but you will get a better quality edition, and you will get 200 pages of letters written by Grant, including letters sent to Lincoln and Halleck. These letters give you an even better insight of Grant the general/husband /person.<br /><br />If there is anyway at all possible that you can spend the extra $9 I recommend doing it.  If you are on a shoe string budget then buy this edition.  It is a 5 star memoir, even without the letters.<br /><br />I have a full review at the other edition, but I will say that I cannot recommend Grant's memoirs enough.  It really is an awesome book.	2005-09-01

Since most of these hikes are either one-way or round trip (as opposed to circuit hikes) you either need to have two cars or plan on seeing the same sites twice. I'm not saying this is a bad thing, but other books have better circuit hikes.<br /><br />This series IS very informative, not only with regards to the actually hike, but also the history both natural and otherwise of the area you are hiking in.<br /><br />I have not used this edition as much as I have the other 2 guides that I own in this series, but it did come in handy during a spur of the moment trip to NC/TENN.  The maps could be a little better, as they are topographical maps with a green line for the trail.. They are adequate, but I've seen better.<br /><br />All 45 hikes come with a description, a map, an elevation profile, and an itinerary, as well as various other information.<br /><br />When planning for a hike I do tend to use this book in conjunction with other books, but I usually take this book (or copies of the pages) on the actual hike itself. The fact that the pages are so small allows for easier handling and storage of the laminated pages during the trip.<br /><br />So if you enjoy hiking and are near the AT while in the 'Southern Appalchians', you may want to take a look at this book.

The maps are not as good, and there are no elevation profiles, but the hikes and their descriptions are wonderful..<br /><br />I have utilized this book with the Hiking VA book to come up with some exceptional hikes.. I recommend the triple crown hike #33, But do Dragon's Tooth as a day hike. Park on 624 and do the 5 mile round trip.  If you have 2 cars, park the other one on 220 (near Roanoke).  After doing Dragon's Tooth, grab your backpack and head North on the AT, to get to 220.. Plan a good 2-3 days.<br /><br />Other great hikes are the day hike to Buzzard Rock, as well as the hikes around Mount Rogers.  Combine the info in this book with that in Hiking VA and create your own trip.  But whatever you do, you have to hike the Pine Mountain trail.. It is awesome..<br /><br />The Appomattox hike is also great as you see some things the everyday visitor misses..<br /><br />Over all an exellent book.

Grant : Memoirs and Selected Letters : Personal Memoirs of U.S. Grant / Selected Letters, 1839-1865 (Library of America)	Books	5	91	91	N	N	A must read	I originally read this book as part of a Masters Level History course at the University Of New Orleans (I wasn't in the program, I just took the class for fun). 2 months, and hours and hours of research later, I turned in a 22 page book report.<br /><br />This is one of the best 'autobiographies' that you will ever read, as well as one of the finest books on the Civil War.<br /><br />Grant was poor, having lost most of his money on poor financial decisions, when he set out to write this. He undertook the project as a way to provide for his wife, however after beginning the writing process, he grew to like it, and his 'memoirs' evolved into a classic.<br /><br />One should note, that this book is really his memoirs about the Civil War.  There are only a couple dozen pages dedicated to his childhood and West Point years.<br /><br />Through his memoirs, one gets a better glimpse into the decision making of the general that they called a butcher.  On his decision to assault Vicksburg in 1963, Grant wrote \\"There was no telling how long a seige might last. ...it was the beginning of the hot season.... There was no telling what the casulaties might be among Northern troops working and living in trenches\\". Grant understood war. He understood that most deaths weren't caused by bullets, but by desease.  He also understood that in a battle of attrition, the North would prevail.<br /><br />This is not to say that there aren't any flaws in this book.  As with all memoirs, certain accounts can be a little self-serving.  Grant's accounts of Cold Harbor and Shiloh are somewhat different then James McPherson and Shelby Foote would have you believe, and in fact in describing his actions at Shiloh he almost contradicts himself. Over all though Grant's writing reveals a very humble person.  He gives Sherman credit were credit is due.<br /><br />The other great thing about this book is that he goes into great depth to explain things to readers who don't have a lot of military knowledge.  Grant describes such things as the erecting of telegraph poles as well as the procedure used to destroy railroads.<br /><br />If you chose to read this book, please read this edition, I have two other printings of this book, and they either lack the letters or are of inferior quality.  The letters in the back shed greater light on Grant the Person, and the quality of this edition is outstanding.  You will find cheaper editions, but you will be dissappointed.telegraph poles as well as the procedure used to destroy railroads.

Yes, I know.. 'Yuengling, what kind of name is that.. it sounds Japanese' All I can tell you is this, growing up in PA, and actually graduating from the author's place of employment (GO HUSKIES), we grew up on this beer. (after we hit 21 of course)<br /><br />The Lager is incredible, although I recommend you get it as cold as possible as it tastes even better as it approaches freezing temperatures..<br /><br />In the fall, swing to their Black and Tan, a slightly more filling beer, but amazing taste.  You don't need it quite as cold as the Lager.. The best part is this stuff comes in 16 oz cans...<br /><br />Next for winter, break open a case of porter.  This stuff is so good you can drink it right out of the case without it ever hitting the fridge.. especially if you live in PA and store it in your garage during the winter months..  After 2 or 3 of the porters, give your keys to your designated driver, and switch back to the Lager, as the Porter is quite filling..<br /><br />For a special treat, may I also recommend the Chesterfield Ale.<br /><br />When I lived in New Orleans and would travel back to PA, my neighbors would ask me to bring cases of this stuff down for them. The Black and Tan is better than Abita Turbo Dog..<br /><br />The best part is you can get a case of this stuff for under $20.  Try getting a case of Guiness for anything near that.<br /><br />So have I read the book? NO, but I have cracked open quite a few Yuenglings in my time.. Maybe it's time to enjoy a few while reading up on the last 175 years.. Although I would have to sacrifice 2 cases of Yuengling to buy the book. HMMMMMMMMMM	2005-08-25

Sections include\\" clothing, footwear, leave no trace. hiking with kids and appalachian trail, as well as several others.  This is something that the Hiking Virginia book lacked.<br /><br />What I didn't like about this book was the way that the hikes were presented.  The detailed maps contained in the Hiking VA book were gone, as was the elevation profile. The information wasn't as neatly presented as the VA counterpart, and I still can't figure out how the hikes were organized.<br /><br />Did this book help me? Yes, but it was no where near as informative as its VA counterpart.<br /><br />One hike that I would recommend is the Mount Mitchell hike. And if you decide to do it, make sure that you 1) Hike the Big Tom trail (it's a killer .5 miles..and the trail leading from Big Tom  to Mount Craig to Mount Mitchell is great) and 2) stop by the restaurant on the road leading up to Mount Mitchell and get a helping of the cobler (with vanilla ice cream of course)..<br /><br />Other worthwhile hikes are the Craggy Gardens and the Linville Falls hike, but beware, parts of the Blue Ridge Parkway have been washed away, and the detour is h#ll..<br /><br />Happy Hiking!!!!!!!!!!	2005-08-24

For anyone looking for great hikes in VA, this is a great place to start. The book contains detailed descriptions of 35 of the best hikes in VA and also list 64 honorable mention hikes. The length of the hikes vary from short day hikes, to 3 day backpacking trips.<br /><br />What is nice about the book is that for the featured hikes, there is a brief description.  Then a ton of information: difficulty rating, available maps, trail contacts, and fees or permits required, available camping etc etc. The book then goes on to describe in detail what you will see on  each hike.  Each hike contains not only a map, but an 'elavation profile' so you can gauge just how hard the hike will be.<br /><br />I would recommend buying this book, and when you choose a hike, make a copy of the corresponding pages and laminate them.  It will save wear and tear on your book as well as give you a water proof map.. Besides, it's also a lot lighter to carry 3 pages rather then a whole book!!!!<br /><br />My favorite hikes in the book have been Mount Pleasant, 3 Ridges (a difficult hike) and the hikes around Mount Rogers and Grayson Highlands.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I recently did a few more of the hikes in this book(14, 18, 19).  DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT follow the authors' advice for the Old Rag hike, #14.  Instead of their route, either 1) Hike the fire road up and down (this is the easiest way) or take the rock scramble up and the fire road down.  There are two problems with the route suggested by the authors. First, on crowded summer days you will have a hard time getting down as the trail is jammed with people going up.  Second, I went during the week when it wasn't as packed and ran into a gentleman going up the scramble as I was going down.  He told me that 90% of the people they carry off of the mountain with broken bones are trying to descend using the 'rock scramble' route.  So if you are going to climb Old Rag (and YOU REALLY NEED TO, it is amazing) then PLEASE, use the routes I recommended above, and if it's a weekend during the summer, be prepared for a long climb up if you take the rock scramble, as people get jammed up in the narrow crevices.<br /><br />Good hiking everyone!!!!!!weekend during the summer, be prepared for a long climb up if you take the rock scramble, as people get jammed up in the narrow crevices.

I need things in prose not verse.  I undertook the reading of Homer's Iliad and Odessey no so much from a literary sense as a historical one.<br /><br />The version of Homer's Iliad that I am reading is the Barnes and Noble version, which itself is written in prose.  Even so, I needed something to help dummy down the Iliad.  This book did the trick.  It contained a character summary in the beginning which enabled me to not have to flip to the beginning of B&N's Iliad edition.  This book also provided historical info, as well as more info on the Gods and Characters in the Iliad.  The drawings were also interesting.<br /><br />It contains 24 'books' just like the Iliad and these books correspond exactly.  In order to 'challenge' myself I would read a chapter in the 'real' Iliad, and then read the corresponding one in this book.<br /><br />For you Lit majors out there, you would probably laugh at this book, but for \\"Lit Challenged\\" people such as myself, this book was a great aid.  Yeah, it's like reading Cliff Notes, so reading this book by itself probably doesn't qualify as reading the Iliad, but if you are approaching the Iliad from a historical perspective, it's not bad.	2005-08-22

Thucydides includes long, detailed speeches that he had either heard first hand, had related to him, or has paraphrased based on the circumstances surrounding the speech.  While some of the speeches are more accurate then others they do help the reader understand what was going on in the minds of the people at the time.  They also help to break up what can sometimes be a monotonous account of the war.<br /><br />The Bad:  As alluded to above, the beginning of the book is filled with speeches.  There are fewer and fewer speeches as the book progresses, until by chapter 8, they are omitted altogether.  This omission of speeches does make the book a little dry, and tough to get through.  I found that I couldn't read the last part of the book for as long a period of time as I could the beginning, and my breaks became more frequent.<br /><br />The book ends in 411 BC, 7 years before the war ended.  One can only imagine how great an accomplishment this book might have been, had Thucydides been able not only to write about the entire war, but had also been able to finish the book with the detail that he started it.<br /><br />The Ugly:  The edition I read was the Penguin Classics edition, while the book may be a classic, the Penguin edition was far from one. The print was terrible and uneven.  The chapter numbers on the left boarder of the page, where fine until they hit triple digits, and then the '1' was either half printed or not there at all.  Several pages where so poorly 'inked' that you could barely make out the letters.<br /><br />The maps were useless except for the one on Attica. As another reviewer suggested, pay a little more and get a better quality edition.<br /><br />Overall though this was a very good book.	2005-08-14

After plowing through the first volume, I couldn't wait to get started on the second volume.  This book was going to be incredible.  After all look what was going to be covered.. Everything from 1603-1776.. This volume would climax with the French and Indian War and the Revolutionary War.  Given Schama writing style in volume 1, this was going to be incredible....<br /><br />But alas.... Although not as bad as the final volume, when compared to the first volume, this could have been soooo much better.  Schama starts to depart from his telling of historical facts and gives way to relating aspects of British culture.  It is almost like Schama can't quite decide on what type of book he his trying to write. Is his audience one with limited knowledge of British History, or is he writing to people looking for a more in depth discussion of certain aspects of Britich Society?<br /><br />His writings about the religious upheavals is interesting and I was particularly intrigued by his detailed account of Oliver Cromwell, but as I finished this book, I could only feel somewhat cheated by his lack of detail in relating the middle part of the 18th century.<br /><br />As with the first volume, the pictures and maps were outstanding.	2005-08-14

It was at this time that the first book of Simon Schama's History of Britain arrived at my door step, and after struggling to try to stay interested in this book I just couldn't take it any more...<br /><br />Jackson does do a decent job of describing the decimating impact small pox had on the tribes, and he starts off by explaining the advancement in the trading posts.  He does make several interesting points.  For instance, once the Indians started trading for guns, they became dependent on the traders for ammunition.  Unfortunately this is where the praise ends.<br /><br />The first problem I had with the book was getting confused with who was who.  As Jackson writes, the Niitsitapi (the people) \\"understood who they were and felt free to change personal names.... Groups were more concerned with identifying outsiders.  ..these group names were often the teasing, slightly derogatory designations of neighbors. ..the writings of poorly informed Europeans froze individual identities and group names...\\"  Jackson does add a section titled Synonymy in which he attempts to 'sort out the various names'.  Jackson also tries to help the reader out by putting the 'European names in parenthesis, but I was still utterly confused at several times in the book.<br /><br />The other problem I had with the book was Jackson's style of writing.  What follows is a list of direct quotes..<br /><br />\\"Going to the store was not a pleasant experience for the Piikani.\\"<br /><br />\\"..going to market was not much fun for anyone\\"<br /><br />On going to the new trading post.. \\"The journey was another test of Kutenai determination\\" and The Kutenai journey was more a trial for them than a risk of outright hostility\\"<br /><br />OK I get the point.  I think there were other times when Jackson wrote pretty much the same thing...<br /><br />I guess what finally made me decide to put the book down was that I just really didn't care too much about the Piikani and their trading habits..<br /><br />Maybe one day, I'll pick this book back up again and read the whole thing, but right now there are just too many more interesting books out there..<br /><br />PS You can pick this up in the bargain section of B&N for about $5.00.and read the whole thing, but right now there are just too many more interesting books out there..

When he finds contradictory stories, he has to decide which is most probable....\\"<br /><br />\\"..every sentence in a story nine centuries old should include the word perhaps: nothing is perfectly certain\\"<br /><br />These two sentences, along with a few others in the introduction, alert the reader to the fact that in order to write about the year 1066 some assumptions have to be made, and some conclusions have to be drawn.<br /><br />As Howarth writes later on in the book, to explain part of the reason for the lack of eyewitness accounts,  ..\\"stories of battles are usually told by the winners, and the winners at ..... were losers a few days later\\".<br /><br />Many 'historical' books are written based on nothing but conjecture.  The author speculates some new theory, feeds the reader one crumb of evidence that somehow supports this theory, all the while ignoring the mountain of evidence that proves his theory wrong.<br /><br />What is so great about this book, is that while Howarth does indeed speculate about certain things, he backs up all of his theories.  He lays out the different versions of the story before giving the reader his theory on how and why things happened.  Do you have to necessarily agree with everything Howarth says? No.. But at least you are given enough information to draw your own conclusions...<br /><br />Especially enlightening to me was Howarth's theory on why Harold acted the way he did at Hastings.  Will everyone agree? NO, but his theory IS plausible especially if the reader is familiar with Papal Bulls.<br /><br />A GREAT BOOK.	2005-05-31

Half way through the book I was cursing myself for not attacking the whole 3 volume set..  Characters flew by at such an alarming rate that I was forced to keep a score card of who was who..  Thankfully Norwich chronologically listed the Emperors, popes and rulers at the back of the book. I was then able to add my own notes as to who was killed, overthrown or simply went insane.<br /><br />Patriarchs are excommunicated before we are even aware that they are patriarchs.<br /><br />All of this information makes the book a little hard to read.,  It's not boring, it's not poorly written, but there is just so much info.  It takes some time for the reader to digest it all.<br /><br />Norwich does a great job of recapping the effect that many of the rulers had on the empire.  His writing during these times is great.  The book serves as a great background for all the events that unfolded during the time of the Byzantium Empire but there really wasn't enough room to elaborate on a lot of the events and people that played a part in it.<br /><br />Again, if you are looking for a short overview of the Byzantium Empire, this is it, if you want more, do what I just did and order the three volume set....	2005-05-25

While the book was a pretty enjoyable read, I am not really sure that Burstein accomplished what he set out to do.<br /><br />It seems en vogue nowadays to go against the grain when writing biographies, and Burstein's effort is no exception. I decided to read this book after seeing an hour-long documentary of Jackson on the History Channel.<br /><br />I was particularly interested in the executions of Ambrister and Arbuthnot. Ironically in a book filled with anti-Jackson material this event wasn't covered in as much detail as I figured it would be.<br /><br />While it doesn't appear that Burstein set out to discredit Andrew Jackson's image, the book definitely trends toward the negative. Burstein uses a lot of Jackson's own words, and in many cases they aren't pretty.  Burstein also keeps a running count of all of the duels, scuffles and scrapes that Andrew Jackson was drawn into to protect his honor. Burstein DOES discuss Jackson's devote love towards Rachel Donelson Robards, (even if the events leading up to the marriage are rightly questioned) and as well as his acts of charity, but the majority of the books serves to tear down Jackson's image.<br /><br />Burstein does try to account for Jackson's flaws by discussing the political and social environment of the times, as will as addressing the fact that Jackson was the first President from 'the frontier', however I was left with the impression that Jackson was an extremist, when it came to protecting his honor. With Jackson there were no middle grounds, it was a personal affront to him to disagree with him politically.<br /><br />Some of the book reads more as a general history book with Jackson as the main character rather then a biography.  This is good in the sense that it may peak the reader's curiosity (as it did mine) to learn more about Burr, Calhoun, Clay and Monroe.<br /><br />One very irritating part of the book, as one reader has already mentioned was Burstein's lack of structure with regards to his references.  Bursteins uses 'notes' and while they are easy to follow, I found myself flipping to the back of the book way too much. What was really annoying was the fact that several of the notes were a paragraph long and should have probably been included in the main text of the book.<br /><br />While Burstein uses his 'Introduction' to alert that reader that what he is about to write is not a 'heroic saga' as many prior biographers have written, after reading this book I was left wondering whether the definitive Jackson biography is still waiting to be written.s to his references.

What is so great about this book is that Phillips manages to write it in a way that captivates a broad audience.<br /><br />Phillips begins the book by 'catching the reading up' on the events that led to the Fourth crusade, from Saladin's capture of Jerusalem in 1187, to the call of the First Crusade by Pope Urban in 1095 to Innocent III's calling for a crusade to re-take Jerusalem (again).<br /><br />Phillips describes to the reader what led men to take up arms for God and travel 2,500 miles, braving desease, lack of food, and a mortality rate upwards of 50%.<br /><br />Phillips' description of the Fourth Crusade, including his description of Constantinople, is awesome, and makes it very tough to put the book down.<br /><br />Phillips also does a great job of recapping everything in his afterward.<br /><br />On the down-side, two small things.  First, once Constantinople is sacked (I didn't give anything away, its says so on the book's cover), Phillips' description of the Latin Empire isn't as inspiring as the rest of the book (although this really only involves the last 2 chapters).  Secondly, I wish Phillips would have gone into a little more depth in talking about Inncocent III.<br /><br />Here is a pope who has called for a crusade against the infidel in Jerusalem, and instead the crusaders staind 'with blood Christain swords that should have been used on pagans' (pg 302).<br /><br />Whether or not Innocent III said this to be politcally correct or not can be debated.  Yes the crusaders had killed 'Christians', but in doing so, they had expanded, albeit briefly, the papel rule.  One might be more inclined to believe that Innocent III felt remorse at the outcome of the crusade, had he not, a few years later set out to eliminate the Cathars.<br /><br />Overall though, this book was a delight to read.	2005-05-09

While reading a Jonathan Phillips book on the 4th crusade, I became interested in Innocent III, so I looked up books on him.  There was only one review of this book and while the reviewer may be right about the book (Innocent III did indeed have his short comings), he does have some facts wrong.<br /><br />Innocent did NOT have the Knights Templar 'summarily massacred' but in fact saved them from being excommunicated.  The Templars then returned the favor by helping Innocent III in his extermination of the Cathars.  Pope Innocent III launched the 4th crusade which went totally array, and instead of slaughtering the Saracens, the crusaders took it out on the Greek Orthodox at Constantinople. And while you might argue that 'Butchery is Butchery' even Innocent III had a problem with killing Christians (the Cathars weren't considered 'Christians')<br /><br />I'll get back to you all with a review when I do actually read this book..<br /><br />PS It was Clement V who sent the Knights Templar into oblivion (unless you believe that some of them survived and buried their treasure in modern day Nova Scotia) nearly 100 years later.	2005-05-05

For anyone familiar with the Cathars and the crusades, this book will probably not provide you with any new information.  For everyone else this book is great.<br /><br />O'Shea does the reader a favor by beginning the book with a section entitled 'Principal Figures in the Cathar Story' which serves as a quick introduction to the figures that will be introduced through-out the book. Inserted through-out the text are maps, illustrations and pictures that help the reader visualize certain aspects of the book.<br /><br />In addition O'Shea ends the book with a chapter debunking many of the myths that have surrounded the Cathars, many of which are the same myths that surround the Knights Templar.<br /><br />O'Shea also provides the reader with a somewhat detailed  \\"Notes' section as well as an extensive bibliography (even if many of the titles are in languages that I don't know).<br /><br />This book serves as a great introduction to the Cathars, the Albigensian crusades and many of the historical figures that shaped the 13th century.  With his Notes and Bibliography, O'Shea provides the reader with the avenues for a more detailed study of any of the aspects in this book.	2005-05-04

During the course of reading this book I took two breaks: one to read Dungeon, Fire and Sword - the Knights Templar in the crusades, and one to read The Pefect Heresy.  After finishing the latter book last night, I returned to the Freemasons, but alas I just can't take it anymore..<br /><br />The closest that I can come to describing the book is to compare it to reading a watered-down history book. Picture your old high school history book, and then imagine it with parentheses after each historical figure.  After some names the word (freemason) would be inserted, after others (not a freemason) would be added, and a few would be followed by (maybe a freemason).  Ridley might have been better off just writing an index of historical figures and sorting them out by these three catagories.<br /><br />I'm not sure if the book is boring because compared to the Knights Templar and the Cathars, the Freemason history just isn't very exciting, or if it is Ridley's style that inspires boredom, but whatever the reason, my mind just kept wandering as I read it.<br /><br />I gave the book 2 stars because it is not a total disaster.  There are some interesting parts, for instance the part about the Boston Tea Party, but unless you really care that 9 of the 55 men who signed the Declaration of Independence and 13 of 39 who approved the Constitution were Freemasons, you would do well to browse this book in a book store before buying...<br /><br />Gotta run, I'm now reading The Fourth Crusade by Jonathon Phillips.. It's awesome...	2005-05-04

OK, the book was good, but I don't understand how it became a best seller...<br /><br />The best parts of the book were those written about the White City and the World's Columbian Expedition.  I especially enjoyed all of the facts that Larson managed to throw in as he was writing about the fair.  (IE how the windy city got it's name, the new foods and appliances introduced at the expo, etc etc). These in themselves made the book an enjoyable read.<br /><br />The story tended to falter when Larson switched over to write about the 'Devil' Holmes.  While Larson did a great job of dangling parts of the story-line in front of the reader at the beginning of the book and then coming back to sew up the loose ends towards the end, there are several instances where characters just fall of the radar screen never to be heard from again (in the book anyway).  These are NOT victims, but rather people whom Larson neglects to get back to (I don't want to give anything away).<br /><br />In addition, one part of the story that was very interesting was his account of a gentleman by the name of Prendergast. Larson should have spent more time developing this amazing story.<br /><br />It is obvious that Larson did an extensive amount of research for this book, and he is indeed a good writer.  The book is an easy and enjoyable read, but again, I don't understand how it became a best seller.	2005-05-02

As this was the first book on the Genghis Khan that I have read, I can't compare it to anything, but I did enjoy it.<br /><br />A few things to note..<br /><br />First, Genghis Khan is already dead half way through the book, so the book, while titled 'Genghis Khan - and the Making of the Modern World' is much more then a biography.<br /><br />Weatherford goes on to describe how Genghis' siblings proceeded to ruin what he had tried to achieve. Of particular interest was the section describing the relationship between the Mongols and the plague.<br /><br />There were some parts of the book that jumped around a bit too much, and at the risk of being labeled as 'someone who cannot read' (see the next review) I will say that some sections should have been edited a little better.<br /><br />For instance on page 142 Weatherford writes '...but their treatment showed how much the Mongols had changed since the time of Genghis Khan'. As best as can be determined by the text surrounding this line, the event happened in 1224. Genghis Khan didn't die until 1227.<br /><br />The book contained 3 maps... A few more would have been great..<br /><br />Finally, for those reading the next two reviews (if you have sorted the reviews in chronological order), the exact text that the reviewers are referring to is as follows... '..in World War II. In a large-scale adaptation of the tactics Subodei used to defeat the Russians at the Kalka River in 1223, the Soviets lured the Germans ever deeper into Russia......and picked them off one by one'. I guess that the key word is 'adaptation'. I'll let you decide what Weatherford was trying to say or imply.<br /><br />Over all though, an awesome book.	2005-05-02

That reviewer then goes on to recommend two books written 10 years later.. That's probably why he thought that this was 'old'. While I can't compare this book to anything by Runciman or Tuchman, I will say that this is a pretty good book.<br /><br />Before you buy this book, please pay attention to the title.. It is called 'Dungeon, Fire, & Sword The Knights Templar IN THE CRUSADES'  In order to understand the impact of the KT in the crusades you have to understand the crusades themselves, and in order to understand the crusades, you need to understand the 'players', culture geography etc... The Crusades didn't revolve around the KT, they only played a part, albeit an integral one, in the crusades.<br /><br />Yes this book is more than just the KT, and no it's not an in depth history of each of the crusades, but it's not supposed to be.. The reader should use this book as a building block about the KT, the crusades and even the Papal State.<br /><br />What is interesting is that the more one reads about the KT the more you realize that there really is a lot of uncertainty and disagreement surrounding them.  In his book, Howarth writes that the master of the Templars was never called the Grand Master, yet that is how Robinson refers to them.  There were a few other descrepencies between the two books but nothing major.<br /><br />The maps (all 3 of them) were ok.  The tables of the 'players' in the back of the book were helpful.<br /><br />I recommend this book.. Could you do better? Maybe, but with all of the junk that they are publishing about the KT these days you could do a heck of a lot worse.	2005-04-28

And with this renewed interest comes people ready to capitalize on it.. and in order to sell books, the themes surrounding them have become more and more outrageous.<br /><br />Fortunately, this book was written 2 decades before Brown's book, and you can be assured that this is a fact based book, and not one of conjecture.<br /><br />To someone who has knowledge about the cruisades and the Knights Templar, this would probably be a very boring book. However, since this is the first book that I have read about the Knights Templar, and one of the first that I have read about the crusades, I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />Having said that, I must add that even though this book is really a 'Knights Templar for Dummies' we aren't treated like dummies. There is one (count it - 1) map, and that is barely legible.  I had to get out other maps and atlases to help me figure out exactly where these places were.<br /><br />In addition, while other books (See Dungeon, Fire, and Sword by Robinson) have lists and tables helping the reader identify who is who, this book has nothing...<br /><br />This book was interesting enough to make me want to delve deeper into the cruisades and the KT, so much so that the next book that I read was also a book about the KT.	2005-04-28

This was in the clearance section - or was it the 'last chance' section - of my favorite Barnes and Noble, and the word 'Medici' in the title caught my eye. I figured that for $5.98 it was worth a shot... It wasn't...<br /><br />I could go on and on with examples of the poor quality of the writing, but I have wasted enough time on this book.<br /><br />What is really discouraging is that for $5.98 I could have bought a newspaper and a soy caramel machiatta with an extra shot..<br /><br />If you are thinking about buying this book... don't. Take the money that you would have spent, and donate it to charity.  You will feel better about yourself, stop yourself from wasting time, and get a tax break out of the deal.	2005-04-28

Not only does Matines do an excellent job presenting the facts surrounding the \\"Pazzi Conspiracy\\", but he takes time to elaborate on 'Social Climbers', arranged marriages, crime and punishment, and many other topics surrounding the Renaissance.<br /><br />Of particular help were the family trees in the beginning of the book.  Without them I could never have kept track of all of the characters. Too many Cosimos, Jacopos and Lorenzos...<br /><br />I do agree with the reviewer who said that the book was a little chopped up, and I feel Martines might have been able to organize it a little better, but this didn't prevent me from finishing it in 2 days.<br /><br />This book helps to make learning about history fun.	2005-04-07

Had I known at the time that I read this book that I was going to write a review, I would have taken better notes.<br /><br />First, let me say that I agree with the reveiwer who stated that the editing was not the greatest. In addition, the lack of foot notes in inexcusable, and actually detract from the strength of points that he is trying to argue. In many ways, this book is actually a book report on Sears' 'To The Gates of Richmond'.<br /><br />Having already read that one, as well as Sears' 'Landscape Turned Red' I found myself referring to them again and again as I read this book. It really is interesting to note how the same information can be used to underscore two totally differnet opinions.<br /><br />Several desrepencies arise bewteen Sears and Ridgeway, most notably the size of the two forces involved in several of the battles, well as the timimg of significant events: When did McClellan first learn that the Battle of Williamsburg had started, and how long did it take him to get to the front... Did he get there 'at about the time' Hancock was repulsing Early and after the 'day no longer needed saving' as Sears writes, or did he get there in time to throw additional forces into the counter-attack thereby bring 'unity and purpose to the situation' as Ridgeway would have you believe.<br /><br />In addition, Ridgeway would want the reader to believe that with all of his training and education, McClellan was THE model general. He states that Sears is out of line by questioning the fact that McClellan was never anywhere close to the actual fighting, stating that as commanding general, McClellan's role was to formulate a broad plan of battle and then let his lieutenants do the fighting. While in theory Ridgeway is correct, one has to question some of McClellan's reasoning.<br /><br />For instance McClellan rushes to the front at Williamsburg to see what is happening and to help out, yet at Antietam, while Burnside is floundering at the bridge, he stays put and only sends orders. This makes no sense. Speaking of Antietam, this is probably the biggest dissappointment of the whole book. It takes Ridgeway a mere 4 pages to recap the action from Hooker's early morning assault to AP Hill's repulse of Burnside's troops... FOUR pages.... After micro analyzing every battle, including South Mountain, Ridgeway's brushing off of Antietam makes you wonder whether he couldn't come up with anything good to say about McClellan's involvement on Sept 17th, 1862..<br /><br />The book is not all bad however. Ridgeway's analogies to subsequent battles, wars, and commanders are interesting, and the book does indeed cause the reader to rethink alot of what has been writen about McClellan.e what is happening and to help out, yet at Antietam, while Burnside is floundering at the bridge, he stays put and only sends orders.
