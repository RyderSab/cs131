All seems lost until Emma tells her parents that she too wants a pet. So for her birthday they take her and her brother, Max, to the pet store where she adopts a lizard they name \\"Stranger.\\" Max relates to Stranger as he is adopted too. <br /> <br />This book is wonderful in many ways as it talks about the affects of life-long allergies, adoption of children and pets, as well as the special bond siblings share, parent love, and how to compromise without giving in or creating hurt feelings. I found EMMA'S STRANGE PET by JEAN LITTLE inspirational, heartwarming, and fun to read with my younger children ages 7 & 8. After reading this book, my children asked several questions regarding adoption and different kinds of pets. <br /> <br />This splendid book would make a wonderful addition to any library and classroom for discussion on any of the topics I have mentioned here. <br /> <br />This reviewer (and her children) highly recommends Little's book EMMA'S STRANGE PET. <br />	2004-10-08

So, that wasn't a real biggie for me.<br />What did bother me is that the reviewer clearly did NOT read &quot;Gargoyle Tears&quot; as there is no mention of an unborn sister anywhere in the book.

Reviewed By: Angela Mink-Torres <br />From an illicit tryst between a security guard and a student at a home for delinquent girls to a chance meeting one night at a bar, Erotic Pleasures Collection of Erotic Short Stories by Brooks Lynn covers all of that, and more. The eight stories presented leave no stone unturned and no secret or secret pleasure buried, and leaves the reader asking for more. My personal favorite was a sensual anniversary celebration that leads to a romantic trip to Ireland and to a stay in an old castle. The characters fulfill not only the physical need but a long term dream of one of the characters. Romance and Erotica have never been such compelling partners then in this story. But if you're looking for something a little more hard core and less romantic, you'll also find it among the pages of this book.<br />This collection is a book that can be enjoyed alone or in the company of a special companion, and leaves this single female wishing she had someone to share it with. Fantasy is the name of the game, and the author is successfully moving towards a win. The very short format of these stories left something to be desired though in some of the offerings. Call me old fashioned, but even in my erotic pursuits I want to know a little bit more about the characters and their naughty peccadilloes. But over all, I would recommend this book, with a hearty and resounding YEEEEEESSSS!	2001-04-11

Born in Africa, one among many, Mr. Nwokogba allowed his move to Long Beach to be guided by forces higher than himself...spirituality.  His previous books EA$Y DOLLARS and SEEDS OF LUCK are available to the public through 1st Books Library in paperback and in electronic format.  His visions, suggestions, and explanatory techniques are ones to be remembered and practiced.  Mr. Nwokogba uses his own life as a foundation for AMERICA, HERE I COME.  It's a story of a child born in a village in West Africa.  The book goes on to tell the story of a child soldier involved in Nigeria's civil war.  A tough life led the character to the United States where racism became a major factor, leading to attempts of suicide.  Spiritual development, destiny, and faith were all he needed to work on change.<br /> I didn't need to read Mr. Nwokogba's book AMERICA, HERE I COME to believe that everyone is here on this earth for a reason, and that coincidences are often overlooked.  However, after reading this breathtaking book, my prior feelings involving spirituality and prosperity of the soul have dramatically increased in faith.<br /> If you believe in reincarnation, after life, or that we all have an inner power, then Isaac Nwokogba's book AMERICA, HERE I COME is a book you must read.  This reviewer found it incredibly intense and awe-inspiring.  Highly recommended.<br /> Read my review for his book SEEDS OF LUCK: The ABCs of Creating Your Heart's Desires by going to: [...]<br /> --Reviewed by Jennifer LB Leese, ASTORYWEAVER'S Book Reviews, [...]	2001-04-11
