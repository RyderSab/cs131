That these events occur before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor should be used to remind students that the war did not begin in December of 1941 but rather that the horrors that would involve America had been ongoing for several years and possibly had already been decided.<br /><br />Additionally, the events of 1940 and the summer of 1941 in all likliehood sealed the fate of the Reich.<br /><br />This could well be read in conjunction with Antony Beevor's extraordinary \\"Stalingrad: The Fateful Siege,\\" also detailing these preliminary events.<br /><br />The gamble by Stalin to procrastinate the building of the defensive fortifications after the old ones were torn down is given much analysis here. Nevertheless it is difficult to imagine the gamble being less in its result than Hitler's loss of interest in conquering GB and pursuing the eastern front. Perhaps if there is any justice in such horror it is that both countries and their Armies were virtual anarchies directed by imbalenced men with no checks and balances on their decisions. When disagreement equates to death, leaders recieve a lot of \\"yes men\\" of all ranks.<br /><br />Extremely well done: worth reading. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury	2005-10-11

It's just spelled differently	Let's see. Washington was a slaveowner. Franklin was an egomaniacal womanizer. Jefferson and Adams couldn't be allowed in the same city much less the same room. The Indian Nation (for the most part) sided with the Brits. Gary. We knew this stuff.<br /><br />I fear that Professor Nash is testing the marketability of his book by telling us (over and over) that this is \\"new,\\" \\"novel,\\" and \\"the real deal.\\"<br /><br />For the most part, many errors of judgment were made all over the 18th century in our treatment of women, minorities, slaves, jews, gays, children, debtors, and those impoverished masses such that that conduct can never be made compatible with the harsh light of today's 'political correctness.' Here's a flash: WE DON'T DO THAT GOOD A JOB NOW. TODAY. WITH EVERYTHING AROUND US.<br /><br />So really, what Professor Nash tells us, that the 'leadership' didn't get along with themselves much less respect eachother, is old hat. That our Revolution was a bloody mess is common knowledge. I think. I hope that memo got out. Professor Nash does tie it all together nicely and for that he gets 5 *****.<br /><br />But what would really be interesting would be to ask the question how did their whiteness, their maleness, their wealth, their slave-owner mentality, their anti-semitism (for the most part), and their land ownership influence the drafting and publication of the three documents that (let's face it) changed the world, The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.<br /><br />Of course we told the pablum view of history to the kids in the 50's, 60's, 70's up to now. What's a bunch of 12 year olds going to do with information that Adams thought Franklin was a a worthless bag of wind and 'that he would do us all a service if he electrified himself with his key,' and that Jefferson slept with the slaves?<br /><br />A prodigious effort. A lot of tedium over things we already knew. 3 stars. Larry Scantlebury	2005-10-11

It is difficult to find a Darth Vader-like villain with the death of Communism for the likes of Len Deighton, Robert Ludlum and Nelson DeMille. Silva keeps the \\"sins of the secret society\\" alive with his pursuit of the 'largest mass murderers' in the history of the world.<br /><br />Here the Vatican is in the cross hairs of Mr. Silva's writing, particularly the complicity of the WWII Pope Pius 12 in turning not the other cheek but a blind eye toward the extermination policies of Eichmann and Goebbles and Der Fuhrer. Did the Vatican know? Did they do more than know? And what was the role of the secret organization crux vera? Dr. Stern was working on a book about the use of Catholic convents and churches to hide escaping Jews from the extermination policies of the Reich, Gabriel is told, 'not much of a reason to get himself killed' Gabriel muses.<br /><br />These are the issues that haunt Silva's reluctant hero, Gabriel, almost like the Archangel Gabriel, surely not a coincidence, as he comes out of hiding to investigate the murder of lifetime friend Bennie Stern in Munich. The ancient Landlady of Bennie's apartment, Frau Ratzinger, gives Gabriel a prescription for a pair of Bennie's glasses and that, along with a telephone number for a British 'tell-all' tabloid journalist is all Gabriel has to start with.<br /><br />Gabriel reminds me of the only good line in Godfather III, where Don Corleone says \\"everytime I try to leave they pull me back in.\\" And like that Gabriel wants to be left alone to do the restoration work of his favorite Bellinis in his favorite city, Venice. He wants so much to be left alone that he refuses to talk to his coworkers and works behind a shroud high above the damp church floor, on a scaffold. But Shamron the aging predator knows where to find him and sends him to Munich \\"where it all started\\" we are reminded. The reference is not to the book nor teaching of Bennie Stern but to Chancellor Hitler.<br /><br />The plotting is riveting; the action taut. A great, great thriller, one of Silva's best. Couldn't put it down. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury.<br /> <br />The plotting is riveting; the action taut. A great, great thriller, one of Silva's best. Couldn't put it down. 5 stars.

From this comes Ian Rutledge, survivor of The Somme (Tennyson writing of his son who died at the Somme said \\"when they ask you why they died tell them because their fathers lied\\") to investigate the mass murder of a farming family in frozen, northern England.<br /><br />The three impediments to smooth sailing for the reader is that the novel refers to times a number of generations past, to battles many have never heard of in a part of the world few are familiar with. The result is that you have an 'unseamless' plot and narrative.<br /><br />Add to this the page-by-page conversations that Rutledge has with a ghost, the ghost of Hamish Macloud, a friend whom he had executed, and the reader's patience is stretched.<br /><br />Good writing.

History looks back and finds Aristotle bisexual, Caeser a stutterer, St. Augustine promiscuous, Lincoln favoring slaveowners, and Roosevelt knowledgeable 6 days before the Japanese attacked Pearl and allowing it to happen so he could overcome the anti-involvement pacifist votes and help his allies out in Great Britain.<br /><br />I did not find, read as a whole, Mr. Cornwall's brilliant text to support the observation that Pius 'helped' the Nazis, but rather that he had a platform to speak from and failed to use it. But that platform that we allege Pius avoided, didn't get a lot of use in 1939, 1940, 1941 and 1942. My recollection of historical reporting revealed that the one person speaking loudly, boringly, brilliantly, repetitively against the Nazis (I think he called them Nassies) was Churchill (who by the way if you recall fell on his face cigar and all 20 years earlier at Gallipoli). And Churchill, up through the burning of the Reichstag in Berlin, faced an enormous amount of resistance in Great Britain, western Europe, AND IN AMERICA. So what did Pius know and what did he do? Did he protect the German Catholics or did he emasculate them?<br /><br />The two points that seem to be evidence that he could have done something is what occurs years later. When (then Cardinal) Pope John Paul II was in Poland, he spoke out against Communism with a fury, held Masses when he was prohibited to, hid strikers in the Cardinal's Rectory, and along with Lech Walensa helped to fulminate the collapse of Communism by his support of the strike at Gdansk. Different times, different villains, different people, different support but ostensibly, still staring evil in the face eyeball to eyeball. Evil blinked.<br /><br />And the other point is in the midst of all of the controversy regarding Pius, maybe it's time to open the Archivo Segreto Vaticano and let the cards fall where they may.

Several criticisms of the book, while accurate, may miss the point. The fact remains that the Third Reich, the Reich that was to last for a thousand years, selected a race to be exterminated.<br /><br />Granted, the extermination policy as well included a variey of hundreds of thousands of others. Like the genocides of the early Greeks placing newborns on the hillside if they failed at a wonderous, historical, subjective \\"normalcy,\\" the Reich also included homosexuals, the disabled, artists, early dissidents, lawyers, and as one reviewer pointed out, 'we shouldn't forget the Slavs.'<br /><br />The horror perpetrated by Stalin probably exceeds that. But we did not have nor do we have now access to Moscow as we did with Berlin and so, while they were more guilty of crimes against humanity the Russians escaped indictment in exchange for conjecture.<br /><br />Having said all of that, the Nazis stand alone in numbers and in methods for attempting to exterminate an entire race. If it's the details we are concerned about, then we should agree that this supercedes the racial genocides in the Middle East, 6000 years old, those in Africa and those in Eastern Europe.<br /><br />So we need to know how this happened and perhaps not punish but somehow understand what the world did, including the Germans, to permit this atrocity to fulminate. And this is one Irish Catholic kid from New York who weighs in with the great Nazi hunters who say, \\"Never Again.\\"<br /><br />We have to understand so that we cannot ever let this happen again. And whether it's Hussein in Iraq or Milovan Slobovich or some potentate in Africa, we must be forewarned and forearmed as to how it begins. It is the apathhy of the world that allows humans in power to destroy humans who aren't. We must protect humans who are racial victems with as much zeal as we bring forth protection of plants and animals facing extinction.<br /><br />Now as a book, Daniel, the red pencil, where was it? Too long, tiring, repetitive. Because you have an axe to grind that not all of your listeners are willing to accept doesn't mean you have to talk them to death. A little less could be more.

I believe that this book is wasted unless you buy into two concepts. One, the media, print, TV, Radio, is there to make money. Bill O'Reilly, to be fair, doesn't offer his conservative views like Mother Teresa, for the poor. Ditto Bill Maher. Ditto Sean Hannity. And really, really ditto for 'fame gives me wisdom' Moore. So while we may not make the jump that the media turns it's back on .  . let's say truth, rather truth is an 'also ran' in the race for ratings, ergo money.<br /><br />Secondly, car bombs, suicide kamikaze-like attacks, wounded soldiers, mourning bystanders, Cindy Sheehan, helicopters (always a great visual byte) and stretchers sell time-print-ink whatever. Building community centers, hospitals, schools, and flying in doctors to innoculate against diseases we forgot 100 years ago like maleria, doesn't.<br /><br />This doesn't make the media business of bringing you literally and figuratively 'explosive' news bad. But it is just that. A business. It's there to make money.<br /><br />So Mr. Kaplan takes us to the 'other battle,' the good battle if you will, and who are the on-the-ground-proponents of that goal? The grunts.<br /><br />What's a grunt? In the Marine Corps they were '0-3's, or infantry. However the term has become generalized in the tight lexicon of the military to include the enlisted men and lower ranking officers who do the work, eat the c-rats, meet with the people, sleep on the ground, douse themselves with mosquito repellant, teach the children (yes, Stephen Stills), build homes, shore up dikes, carry food, and give an example to forgotten peoples in forgotten corners of the world not of American imperialism but of world humanitarianism.<br /><br />You won't like this book if you're a warlord or a liberal. But it is the other side of the Iraq film clips you see every night on Fox, NBC et al. I thought it was brilliant. Kaplan too does this for money.

I think"	Professor Woods best selling book on history attracts a lot of attention much like the \\"Everything you wanted to know\\" books and to some extent the \\"reads like a novel\\" history books of Ambrose and Howarth. And of course additionally it is that a \\"new\\" or novel approach to history is both refreshing and controversial.<br /><br />It's much easier to imagine that Rome sacked the world because they were pagan imperialists who worshipped multiple gods and goddesses than to say they were stuck in the economic milieu of having numbers of people they could not feed and that coupled with being the major player in a time when the rest of world (the UK; Germany) was wearing loincloths and painting their faces blue, their conquests were as much to feed the masses as to rule the world.<br /><br />I found most of Professor Woods' revelations to be common knowledge, just not published or televised (ah, there's the rub) in print or on the tube. Of course the pilgrims weren't racists and Lincoln had as many slaveowner friends as not. Look at the Declaration of Independance for heaven's sake.<br /><br />My only theoretical conflict with the book is the lauding of state's rights. I would submit that many states would veer off the tracks like a train if left to their own devices. The success of the Democracy is the strength of the Federal Government working hand in hand with the states. It's the longest running show in history. The states haven't done as poorly as Professor Woods suggests, ergo the fundamental purpose of the Supremacy Clause. And yes, there have been gaffes in the fed but there have also been the benefits (granted at horrific cost) of WWII, the Marshall Plan, Brown v. Board of Education and the Heart of Atlanta decision.<br /><br />A very good book chock full of important information. A good history book should provoke, not polarize. 5 stars.

I saw Coach Barry Alvarez on ABC after Wisconsin beat Michigan last week. This week's hot-chick-with-a-microphone (I'm not here for my looks I'm here for my talent) asked him 'how does it feel to beat Lloyd Carr?' Dumb question typical of sideline reporters.<br /><br />Alvarez is the coach of the University of Wisconsin football team; Carr is his counterpart for the University of Michigan. They are in an athletic conference known as the Big Ten. That's the last of my football analogy, I swear.<br /><br />Alvarez, who had never beaten Michigan said, \\"I didn't beat Coach Carr. Our guys and his guys played a great game.\\"<br /><br />That refusal to be self-absorbed and the center of attention is both remarkable and refreshing. It is easier of course to be compassionate when you win. Ironically, Coach Carr said ostensibly the same thing a little while later.<br /><br />Football isn't a way of life but gratefully liberalism in America isn't either.<br /><br />Mr. Smith's book is not a primer on the theory of being conservative, it just points out in simplistic terms what the Constitution says and how differing views have attempted to alter it. Some might say ignore it. The larger view of liberal thought is in fact in the form of a series of questions. Why do they keep yelling at the \\"right-wing\\" and calling them names?<br /><br />I don't think Mr. Bush is going to apologize for his heritage or wealth. I don't think he has to. I saw that interview with Preseident Clinton in the 'library' and all I can think of was 'damn, Bill, not bad for a poor boy from Arkansas.' He seems to have done all right for himself as well.<br /><br />But why personalize your attacks? The Republicans won. Twice. Try to win next time. It doesn't seem judicious to implore people to believe that the Democratic Party lost only because of mind-control by the Republicans. Certainly, in any argument, you need to look at your self as well. Don't you?<br /><br />I have to admit that as I age I recall my mother's caveat when I would avoid my chores with the adage, \\"if you spent half the time doing your chores (her title, not mine) as you do trying to get out of them, they would be done.\\"<br /><br />If the Democrats (it seems) spent as much time trying to figure out why the entire center of the country turned against them in the last two elections instead of listening to Michael Moore, Bill Maher and Ted Kennedy (they're all comedians), maybe they would get somewhere.

It is well written and as any mystery-adventure-thriller needs to be, it is exciting and well paced.<br /><br />Frank Corso, the angry but brilliant center of other Ford endeavors, get's drawn into the horrific bio-terrorism scene when more than 100 of Seattle's commuters are killed in the Pioneer bus tunnel. The book travels quickly mixing sufficient portions of fear, outrage, police procedures and science to keep most readers interested. There are three areas that I found tedious.<br /><br />I don't think that the fictional novel genre is the right place for personal political commentary. Whether you're Oliver North or GM Ford, I think (at least for me) that what you want to do by reading fiction is to spend a few hours in the theater of your mind, not being yelled at by the author's and his/her personal vendetta on given subjects. Corso's outrage maybe appropriate but if you want that you need to go over to the NON FICTION section of Borders. I'm not interested in it in a novel and I find it bordering on pandering.<br /><br />Secondly, it is the anger. An outburst here, an outburst there is OK. Constant mecurial explosions remind me of a family member you are fearful of inviting to a child's birthday party because you just don't want to hear (again) how 'the cops are pigs and we're all being crushed under the thumb of George Bush.' Again, that's in a different section of Borders. It's right next to the Michael Moore insightful text on life in America.<br /><br />Finally, too much of the book makes new readers dependant upon previous personal facts and history of the main characters.<br /><br />I'll read Ford again but I had difficulty with some of these passages. 3 stars.

Deaver, a tough, smart kid from New York, paints his canvas with familiar colors, intelligent, relentless forensic research, tangential to what all of us love in 'police procedurals,' and New York City. The city is magnetic for the opposing feelings of passion and cruelty, dirt and illumination, joy and fear.<br /><br />As with all the novels, it begins with crime and outrage, introduces us with what we now know to be the gorgeous, brilliant and slightly emotionally injured Sachs, and watches Lincoln lay out all the painting materials essentials to create yet another masterpiece.<br /><br />But the problem here is the dialogue. It doesn't seem to fit. George Pelecanos seems to do a competant if not above average job of African-American dialogue and Robert B. Parker 'appears' to have done that with the Spenser series for the last 30 years. But it doesn't seem to work here.<br /><br />We have a need to feel comfortable with the dialogue. How often have you seen a movie where the star is asked to speak with an eastern european accent and it just doesn't fly? Irish people are always complaining that so and so playing the part of a soldier in Sinn Fein or the IRA doesn't 'sound' right. And here, the dialogue to and about and between African Americans doesn't appear to work.<br /><br />I found it to be an impediment I didn't need or want in a new novel. Others found it to be offensive. I leave to you what your decision is, however I felt it was not up to Mr. Deaver's usual quality. 4 stars. Larry Scantlebury	2005-09-18

What you have to know about Cruz Smith is that he has an enviable style which flirts with real darkness but permits flashes of light, ergo redemption. So the writing is not hopeless as say, in Dubus. It's Russian in it's sadness but there's unrelenting humor and occasionally, hope.<br /><br />Here Arkady Renko, the formerly excellent Russian investigator (and frequent Cruz Smith protagonist) turned mediocre by a lack of willingness on his colleagues to do their job, a lack of funding and personal tragedy, comes to Havana to discover what he can about the possible death of a friend, Segei Pribluda.<br /><br />Along the way he meets planned resistance, runs into as much carefully researched description of Cuba as Cruz Smith had in pre-war Japan, is beaten, arranges numerous meetings with the oddest (and most real) of people, and brings us along for the ride.<br /><br />One of the best writers of mystery fiction around today.

I have to admit there's something very 'catchy' about Coben and Myron Bolitar. Myron certainly is the antithesis of the Ian Fleming characters. You just don't get that feeling of panache and savoir faire. Ditto Spenser and Elvis Cole. But you do get an apprecaition that he's tough when he ought to be and sees things through. And, along with that, he has Esperanza (isn't that a take off on 'esperanto,' the mingling of all forms of communication?) as his secretary-friend-advisor, and the stone cold killer thank-goodness-he's-on'your-side, Windsor Lockhorn III. Quite an amalgamation of characters.<br /><br />Here Myron is approached by the girl that broke his heart (don't we alll have someone who did that?) and he reacts as I believe most of us would. GO AWAY!<br /><br />But as some of my friends might say, 'then she lays the 411 on him' and he changes his mind.

As one reader put it, 'I love this period piece.' As I had conversations with my father about his growing up in New York, it always seemed to me that this was a cool period to hang out in, the '40s and the early '50's. Life is easier now but it doesn't seem as much fun. Spend a few minutes watching MTV and suits yelling at eachother on Fox, and tell me about the shortcomings of radio.<br /><br />Anyhow, it has it's dark side. Imagine my surprise when I learned as a young man that the Cole Porter lyrics \\"I get no kick from champagne, mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all, so tell me why should it be true, that I get a kick out of you?\\" was originally written as 'I get no kick from cocaine.' And here I thought my generation invented it.<br /><br />The problem is that Pete Karras is such a self centered, self absorbed hero, you have trouble liking him. And I still think that whether it's Odysseus, Shane, 'the Man with No Name,' the Harrys, Callahan and Bosch, or Jack Reacher, you have to like the hero a little. Pete Karras? If I lived next door to him I would move.<br /><br />I like that the Pelecanos characters have clay feet. Don't we all? But Karras the father (see Dimitri in later novels) did nothing for me. I prefer for reasons that I can't explain given Pelecanos' heritage, the African American characters that evolve with Derek Strange and now, Lorenzo Brown. So this is in no way a knock on George, who together with his brilliant work screenwriting parts on The Wire, continues to put out top shelf stories. Definitely 5 stars +.

Bill Maher just copied a style of comedy that preceded the New Testament.<br /><br />As a comic, he's 5 stars. As a savvy, insightful political commentator, come on, are you kidding? Your not telling me he's more insightful than Dick Gregory or Carlin or Rock. He can't carry their bags. He's funny. That's it. Larry Scantlebury	2005-09-06

And the fact that Mr. Levin basks in the glow of believing he is right (you may choose to interpret 'right' as a double entendre)AND substantial royalties, should not be a reason for ignoring his viewpoint. In many respects, I both admire and share his analysis. But before I get to that, let me make a couple of observations.<br /><br />One, the founding fathers didn't know about topless dancing, possessed slaves or were in close ties with WEALTHY WHITE MEN who possessed slaves, had really no flag to burn much less be apoplectic by that thought, and lived with one shot muskets, not seven hundred rounds per minute automatic rifles that you can buy, 'yes Virginia,' right here in downtown America. So what they intended of The Court was really framed in a much more limited vision. It wasn't 'blinder' vision; it was more like 'tunnel' vision.<br /><br />Secondly, like the lovely Ann Coulter, the the debonaire Sean Hannity, and the teary breast clutching Geraldo, this is Levin's schtick. He is paid enormous sums of money to express those views. He is (sorry Mark) like the extremely poorly dressed toastmaster for the left wing (booed off the stage by his own posse in Hollywood) Michael Moore.<br /><br />Don't you need to know that first? We're running out of people whom we can trust to express what they really feel because the Rathers and the Brokaws are making 3 million a year and Moore gets 20 million a picture. Come on. That's what's between the lines. Not the conspiracy to ruin America.<br /><br />OK. Off on a tangent. Here's what I think. I believe the court does the right thing and sometimes, comes up with answers I neither expected nor particularly like. But that's what America is all about. And that the court can overrule the House makes me ecstatic because those guys, the Durbins and the Kennedys, I really don't trust.<br /><br />It's the longest lasting democracy . . . ever. And along the way we have had to free the scum of the earth (Miranda) overreach to protect white people from themselves (no, not Brown but Heart of Atlanta) and rule in favor of choice because do not do so (as in to ignore it) forces some women into compulsorary child bearing. And the Supremes have made errors. And Plessey was and is a horrible stain on their robes as is Korematsu. But in all those years, there's been no photographs of them on trips to the Bahamas, no pictures of them at fraternity parties drunk and hanging with the cheerleaders, no enormous credit card charges at bars, no indictments of lying to the Federal Judiciary, and no public denials of private wrongs.<br /><br />So I'm going to go with the Supremes. I think some of them are goofy and all of them have, on occassion, come up with decisions that make me wonder what cave they're living in. But I believe, for all of their imperfections, that the founding persons (thank you very much) knew what they were doing when they initiated the Supremacy Clause and gave each branch of the government the right to veto the others. Mr. Levin, an excellent book. I gave you 5 stars. But you're an entertainer. You gave up all rights to point out the error of other's ways when your paycheck was tied to your ratings.

No. Seriously. He doesn't always do this but this Sunday he talked about the Gospel of St. Matthew on 'neighbors.' You know the one I mean, 'the greatest commandment is to love your neighbor as yourself.' Rumor has it that the speaker of that mandate (I certainly don't want to offend anyone here) wasn't just talking about my neighbor Jimmy Boyle with the cute wife and the twins in Little League. Nor was he talking about Sharon, the Religeous Ed teacher who went to some school in Boston. Or my ninth grade history teacher who was really cool, Mr. Heslin. Jamaal? Willy? Shatiqua? Mohammadu? He might have been talking about those cats.<br /><br />It's hard to indict the screaming left. It's hard because the Democratic Party has done such good things. It was instrumental in Brown v. Board, voter registration, Heart of Atlanta, keeping children out of brutal working conditions, and creating unions to stand up to an amoral management, but to name a few instances of its influence.<br /><br />But the biggest problem currently is that they yell at you. It's very difficult to have a reasonable conversation with a true left wing advocate. I teach in a local college. On occasion, debate will commence on various government-related topics. I always begin the semester by saying that we can debate on any issue with me, guests, or fellow students. Only two rules. (1) Speak only about facts. No sound bytes; no slogans. (2) No Yelling.<br /><br />Miller is a man who has seen both sides of the fence and says I don't want to be here, the left, anymore. Here's the interesting thing. I don't think he is treated as a returnee from a POW camp. I think that most Republicans are as apprehensive about Zell Miller as they were about German professionals who saw the light and decided to come over to the Allies, once they were captured.<br /><br />I don't know if Mr. Miller is right. He says what I feel. Certain Democrats have made catastrophes of their lives yet pretend to speak from a podium of moral appropriateness(Kennedy; Hart), have said terrible things to get press coverage (Dick Durbin), and in an attempt to get the President (Bush lied; WMD; Karl Rove is evil) will go on tabloid televison to thwart the effort in Iraq.<br /><br />I don't know if Iraq is a bad decision. I know Cindy Sheehan doesn't know. I'm positive that Michael Moore doesn't know, and having listened to this guy for thirty years, I'm equally certain that Geraldo doesn't know.<br /><br />That's what Miller is saying. The Democratic Party he grew up in changed. In it's own way it began to grab on to issues that were important but not National. It saw the Presidency as the Prize, not the Nation.<br /><br />Miller may not be correct but look at the responses if you don't believe what I am saying. The negative responses are slanderous, ageist, reckless and offensive. That's what the problem is. Take it and debate it. Don't respond with 'he's a cranky OLD man.' There's some pretty fine American men and women out there who paid their price for America and contributed to the fund called freedom who are cranky and old.<br /><br />The other point which is noticeable if you look at the reviewers who would cast Mr. Miller adrift in the sea, is that they write very few other reviews. A brief examination of the numbers of reviews harsh, vitriolic and frequently offensive critics have written reveal several in the 20's, a couple of 16's, a 9 , an 8, two 1's. What does that mean? You can call Mr. Miller misled. You can say he's unfair. You can say he's mistaken. But don't say he's a cranky old man. Good stuff from Mr. Miller. 5 stars.

I thought it was well written with procedural detail and numerous surprises, some small, some large. There was more involvement with Kiz Rider and some of the old faithful like Jerry Edgar.<br /><br />Harry goes back to the force, where he is greeted by the new Chief with some reservation, and threatened by Irving. Harry's \\"cold case\\" involves a High School 16-year old, taken from her family unconscious with a stun taser, and shot in the heart with a stolen pistol in 1988. DNA was a fledgling science then, and the case was caught by two detectives, Garcia and Green, and the investigation, not just because of them, remains of questionable value and merit. Although Green is a natural, Garcia may not have been able to find the seat of his pants with both hands.<br /><br />Harry and Rider work the case from various angles relying on their own special gifts. Turned down by a Judge for a warrant for a tap, Harry presses to the point of being asked if he has a toothbrush on him, a sure sign the Judge is just about to give him a night in the lock-up for contempt.<br /><br />Very well done. Here are the weaknesses. Harry is haunted. Vietnam. The tunnels. Failed relationships. Casual almost meaningless sex. But here it doesn't come through. Connelly intimates that Harry's become sort of a friend over their 15 year career and obviously, the Concrete Blond Harry and the Black Ice Harry can't be recycled. But maybe Harry's become too much of a friend.<br /><br />The Harry I have in mind is the one where you're happy he's around but you just don't want him living next door with you. He's broken. He's lost something somewhere. He in his own words, 'speaks for the dead.' A noble calling but not one that lends itself to sharing stories about the Lakers and the Dodgers over the manly exchange of power tools. This Harry here in The Closers, well, he was kind of nice. Brrrr.<br /><br />And then, too much procedure. That's what makes Connelly shine but you can go overboard. He sounds from time to time like W.E.B. Griffith describing the sanitary contents of a Marine's ruck sack.<br /><br />He gets 5 stars because he's Connelly writing about Harry. But it could have been 4.

I too believe that Mr. Durham has spent a great deal of time addressing one of the mysterious characters of human history, Hannibal, and has written an interesting, if not extremely long story on that topic.<br /><br />But like Attila, many of the Caesars, Leonidas, and other despots-murderers-discoverers-leaders-monarchs-warriors, we just don't know a whole lot. Most of it is conjecture, and when we attribute guesswork to what so and so said, or did, or especially, what so and so felt, we owe the reader an explanation and a THIS IS FICTION AND I DON'T REALLY KNOW AND I'M LIKE YOU 'JUST GUESSING' disclaimer<br /><br />Naturalists who study aspects of animal behavior are called ethologists. Many of them agree that aspects of human behavior, grief, stress, sadness can't be proven in animals. Descriptors of emotion, such as fear, sadness, loneliness, and affection, are subjective representations of a human state.<br /><br />Likewise, discussions between Hannibal and his wife Imilce about the rearing of their son, Hannibal seeking advice on the propriety of ruling from his sister, Hannibal standing on the peak of the Alps crossing urging the men on (in a dozen languages) you know, probably never happened. So I ought to know as a reader that this is all educated conjecture, and for the most part the application of 21st century 'niceties' to an age nearly 2400 years earlier where an old man was 19 and women procreated at 14. Touugh times to be a follower. Not only was the view the same, it was short lived.<br /><br />Pressfield and a more current example, Unger, get away with events in which there are no living survivors and little (if any) history of conversations, by spending a lot of time on the event and less time on the dialogue. Robbins has an event extremely historically reported, and weaves the lives of three or four characters through the occurrence. But the event is in control.<br /><br />Mr. Durham has so much dialogue that I feel I fell asleep on the couch and woke up to find \\"Desperate Housewives\\" in Rome, or Sparta, or Carthage, two thousand years ago. Enough. I respect the effort but found it to be tedious and pure guesswork. 3 stars.

Well, they're both great leaders. And I think that Mr. Welch also played hockey. That might be it.<br /><br />Here's a tough one. What can they teach us? Probably nothing. I can't skate and it's unlikely that I will end up as a CEO of a billion dollar company. And it's more than certain that the issues that Captain (of industry) Welch and Captain (of the Red Wings) Yzerman run into, I will never have to address. If you're like me, you're a regular human and you wonder why things don't work and could they work better? Pierce and Newstrom write great introductory essays on points and issues and then leave us to read the best articles on that topic.<br /><br />Why are women better leaders in certain circumstances? How do leaders emerge? How do leaders define meaning? Is it fluid? Is it dynamic? What makes followers follow because if they don't, then all these leadership questions are like the old philosophy axiom about the 'tree falling in the forest.' And what is the right stuff?<br /><br />I found this very informative and selected it as the text my school is going to teach Leadership from. I guess if I am tarred and feathered at the end of the semester it won't have been a success, but I'm betting it will be extremely well received. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury	2005-08-25

And I find his books well researched, enlightening and thrilling. But there needs to be some logical even if albeit unexpected ending. Here, not so.<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code conspiracy here is in the Sacred College of Cardinals, in the very government that runs ONE BILLION CATHOLICS. That's a lot of Hail Mary's from a guy that's said quite a few Hail Marys himself. And I would venture a guess that Mr. Berry is not that happy with his roots, which appear to be Catholic. I'm not sure; doesn't make any difference. But, a lot of people in and out of the church aren't too happy. I think that's probably the nature of the God-Man relationship. You believe it and accept it or you don't.<br /><br />So Mr. Berry posits that the Visitations of Mary were in fact real and she spoke to a select few, and the few were not prelates of the church but rather the most common of folk . . . if you believe, that's kind of how it went. And the church revealed part of the conversations heard by the folks . . . but Berry alleges, not all.<br /><br />And what the church conspired to hide was tumultuous. Staggering. Incredible. And also, unbelievable. I can't really describe the topics because that gives away the ending. Nor is the ending offensive. Nor are the conclusions Mr. Berry reaches necessarily wrong. It's just not going to happen. The conclusions that James Patterson arrives at in Beach House I and II, as ridiculous as they appear that cross mutation can create children who can do orbital physics in their head and sprout wings (and fly), makes more sense than Mr. Berry's conclusion.<br /><br />Steve, you had me until the Third Secret.

I do not find the liberal left to be offensive or even repugnant. I'm not crazy about some of their ideas but my suspician is, that's what makes it America. That's why we can burn the flag. That's why we can dance naked in expression of our right to free speech. But if your spiritual leader is Ted Kennedy, and your toastmaster is Michael Moore, Good God Man, can you even wonder why people don't take you seriously?<br /><br />This guy is a comedian. I mean, that's all he is. He's George Carlin. OK. He's two George Carlins. Buy this book . . . to line your daughter's parakeet cage. What country does he live in?<br /><br />You know, I just thought of it. This will change my mind. The next movie he makes on how terrible the country is, something even more critical than F911, something so offensive as to make normal, church going Dems cringe, if he takes all the profits, HIS and all of his \\"FRIENDS\\" and turns all the money over to the Democratic National Party, then I'll admit he's got some moxie.<br /><br />But until he does that, let's face it, he's just another capitalist making a buck. 1 star.

I picked this up after reading the cover because it sounded like a new perspective on families and stress, not an old plot necessarily told for the umpteenth time. It kind of reminded me of the old Alfred Hitchcock thrillers, the \\"ordinary man,\\" James Stewart, Cary Grant, caught up in a circumstance so far over his head that he's almost paralyzed.<br /><br />Nick Conover, Hockey star, Michigan homer, rises to the top as CEO of Stratton, only to find himself beset with corporate near Caesar-like conspiracies, trouble at home with his hulking teenage son, seemingly turned-on by his best friend the company CFO, and missing his wife who was killed in a car accicdent which Nick blames himself for.<br /><br />Then he meets Cassie, who is frankly hot, sexy, smart and haunting. And that's just the prelude.<br /><br />The description of the pressure on Nick is fantastic. If there's a drawback it's that the secondary characters are just that, secondary. Mr. Finder seems to develop the relationship that Nick has with his son or that Detective Audrey Rimes has with her husband, well. But the actual secondary characters, Audrey, Scott, Todd, are descriptive but a little shallow.<br /><br />Still a great read which I coudn't put down. 4 stars. Larry Scantlebury	2005-08-11

I didn't find Brimelow's comments to be any of those. Here's what I think is the common thread. The 'commonality' he speaks of need not be caucasion nor need it be male (that would be lonely) nor need it be Christian. But it need be American. The quilt is multicolored and with differing sizes but to paraphrase the words of Mr. Franklin, '[it] had best all hang together.'<br /><br />We don't hang together anymore, Brimelow reasons. Attempts to placate different minorities have forced them into isolation. And the reality of it is that the attemps have been foiled on both sides of the issue. We used to have isolated areas of first the Irish, then the Italians, then African Americans. We still have but add Asians, Muslims, Eastern Europeans, and Africans. And we make no attempt to assimilate those people into America.<br /><br />The Immigration policy would seem to favor that. Once here, organizations filled with the postulate of self autonomy see no reason to learn our language but are embraced by the belief that we favor many languages. Well. Brimelow thinks that's the point. The quilt is coming apart. In England untrammelled immigration permits groups to live off of the welfare system, receive stipends ffrom the government, and preach destruction to the British Empire.<br /><br />Brimelow raises some interesting points, worthy of debate, not villification. 5 stars.

Bernard Goldberg writes, I believe, not really about politics. He writes about the 1st Amendment and how the concept of this most cherished freedom, the freedom to speak (still not so in many nations of the world, by the way) is abused just to get 'air time.'<br /><br />Some of the comments are side-splittingly funny, but some make you ask the question 'I wonder if this fella stayed up all night just so he could say something NO ONE ELSE HAS SAID, no matter how ridiculous.'<br /><br />Our culture criticizes and derides the 50's for lacking the courage to attack convention, and in exchange Goldberg asserts there is little convention left because we've pared it to the bone.<br /><br />Rappers, MTV mavens, politicians flapping their gums in 15 second sound bytes and actors who confuse fame with insight are all targeted by Goldberg. Why must we undermine the virtues that got us here is his ultimate question? Highly recommended. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury	2005-08-10

First of all, I liked this book. If there is a concern I have it's how darn serious this has all become. People yelling at eachother. I mean they make a million dollars a year and there's a limo downstairs waiting to take them home to Tarrytown and they're yelling at eachother. Novak just walked off the set after uttering the second 'no-no' word. Well, Mike Gallagher has some fun. Kudos to him.<br /><br />It's a funny life. He doesn't express himself as a seer out to save America from itself. Yeah. He makes no bones about targeting liberals. I mean Bernie Goldberg targets \\"people who screw up America.\\" At least it's a little covert. But like Coulter, Gallagher puts on his gloves and makes no bones about who is in the ring with him.<br /><br />I do enjoy his humor. I am uncomfortable with parts of the liberal view. Apparently, a majority seem to be also. Nevertheless, this doesn't mean I want to arm my children and live in the basement and use my GranDad's WWII short wave radio.<br /><br />Gallagher has fun.

I should remember that and consider that many authors, having tasted success, will at one point or another submit a manuscript that they wrote 20 years earlier or trot out an old plot done brilliantly 100 years ago and change it to be contemporary. And certainly that's what this is. So why would you forgo the classic \\"Count\\" to read a scene for scene copycat edition?<br /><br />There are two things different about the Dumas classic and this copy. One is the title, \\"Exact Revenge.\\" I point to that because it's a play on words that Mr. Green offers, 'exact' as an adverb, precise, exactly the same, and as a verb, to demand rigorously, to take. Either way, it fits the old adage 'revenge is best served cold.' And secondly, there is a slight Ludlumesque twist on the ending that I can't give away.<br /><br />Yet there is nothing else new. I am puzzled by the accolades of such men as Demille who proclaims this as the second coming. Nelson. Would you want your accolades to be as trivial and meaningless?<br /><br />Mr. Green is an excellent author. This detracts from his reputation. Exactly. 1 star. Larry Scantlebury	2005-08-04

Some readers have criticized Valley of Bones as being too convoluted, too vague, but I just don't see it. I do see it as complicated. It's not Spenser and it's not Elvis Cole. It's more like James Lee Burke and John LeCarre. It's an excellent novel but like those one in a thousand novels, it asks the reader to work as hard as the writer. The benefits of the story won't come to you unless you're willing to role up your sleeves. Like LeCarre, Michael Gruber makes the reader commit to effort.<br /><br />Jimmy Paz is a pretty boy. He gets to wear $1000 dollar suits because he is just that. He's well cut and he wants his suits to be well cut. He demands that of his new partner, Tito Morales, a rookie cop called to a Miami Hotel over a disturbance. The disturbance? 'One of the guests tried to fly,' he tells Paz when Jimmy rolls in . . . 'from the tenth floor.' Paz is promiscuous. He's a gigolo without the capital \\"G.\\" Oh yeah, and he has a violent, violent temper. Oh yeah. One other thing. He cuffs himself to his bed because he walks in his sleep.<br /><br />Lorna Wise is a psychologist, a state employee by choice, a PhD who doesn't want the exposure of private practice. As full of himself as Paz is she's an empty sack, sleeping with married men and collegues, ashamed of her body (which ain't bad, we are told) and ashamed of herself, outside and in. She's a mess. Oh yeah. She thinks she's doomed to die. Soon. She makes 'acute hypochondria' sound as simple as an ad for Johnson & Johnson bandaids.<br /><br />These are interesting people but they're Booster Club Moms and Dads compared to Emmylou Dideroff, drug dealer, revolutionary, hooker, nun, ecstatic, and frequent conversationalist with saints. Deceased saints.<br /><br />Here's just a note from the mouth of Emmylou: \\"What passes as goodness between us fallen human beings is generally not more than a mutual picking of lice from our fur, and a suspension of our desire to eat eachother up. It is only social goodness.\\"<br /><br />How do you get to meet these three people? Well, Mike Gruber weaves a troika of stories. First there's the History of The Sisters of The Blood of Christ. Then there's the confessions of Emmylou Dideroff, as she writes them over the course of four notebooks imprisoned in a state mental hospital for the murder of the flyer. Seems evidence points to his takeoff as being non volitional. Oh. Would you like to guess who is her therapist? And then of course is the murder mystery itself which by now has graduated to a multiple murder mystery.<br /><br />One last point. Lee Burke mentioned earlier and John Connolly both have characters who speak to the dead. This is occasionally unrealistic and awkward. Gruber pulls this off seamlessly. This is the best new novel I have read in 2005. 5 stars. Larry Scantleburyess.\\"  <br /> <br />How do you get to meet these three people? Well, Mike Gruber weaves a troika of stories.

What do you like about your fictional heroes?<br /><br />Moral Outrage<br /><br />Fearlessness<br /><br />Droll sense of humor<br /><br />Bulk, speed and hitting THROUGH objects<br /><br />Slow to anger, swift to punish<br /><br />Loyal<br /><br />Extremely analytical<br /><br />Unlimited retribution if you cross HIS line<br /><br />High intelligence<br /><br />Low maintenance<br /><br />Of course Reacher has all of this. Thank goodness there's another Reacher story to entertain us. But it's like a fine old Scotch, though. You want to hold off drinking it. I've had the new book for about three weeks now because I just knew when I picked it up I wouldn't be able to put it down.<br /><br />Here sniper fire kills 5 civilians in Indiana. The only clue for the reader is the substantial amount of forensic evidence against the man the police arrest, Barr, who happens to be a Gulf War vet and, naturally, a feared sniper. He does not break in the subsequent interrogation but finally makes just one request. Jack Reacher.<br /><br />What I found particularly intriguing about \\"One Shot\\" was the clues. Mr. Child leaves many around but with Gospel like promise, 'many are called but few are chosen.' He does that a lot, have you noticed? He does that with \\"Echo Burning\\" when Carmen leaves a message for Reacher that she was a \\"street stroller.\\" I missed the clue and as he later admits a few hundred pages later, so did Reacher. See Mr. Child leaves worthless clues that Reacher and we ignore, important clues that both Reacher and we get, some clues that we miss but Reacher gets, and some, I guess, that we both miss.<br /><br />The interesting thing about Reacher (well, one of the interesting things) is that he grows from novel to novel. This seems to produce two effects: 1) the books can stand alone but they do refer to other people in other books like his brother Joe and Jodie and General Garber. And, 2) you get to look at the whole work. It's almost (don't laugh at me here) like Dumas writing the Three Musketeers. It starts off with 1, then 2, then 3 stories but eventually grows in its entirety to become an entire piece unto its self. They're not related but they are.<br /><br />Jack Reacher may not be the guy you want to hang out with. Hell. He doesn't want to hang with anyone. But when the stuff is hitting the fan, there's no one else you want to have around. He's John Wayne, Steve McQueen, Clint Eastwood all in one. He's 'Whistling Dan Wheeler' bringing the airliner into California with no fuel left and Alan Ladd riding off into the sunrise with that obnoxious kid yelling after him. He da man! 5 stars. Fantastic ending. Great stuff. Larry Scantlebury. It starts off with 1, then 2, then 3 stories but eventually grows in its entirety to become an entire piece unto its self.

Books	5	12	60	N	N	Don't try this at home!	I grew up in New York. It really is, as Sinatra sings (he's still alive, ain't he?) 'a helluva town.' And for all the hype (See Lupica or Kornheiser on TV for more than 10 minutes - if you can) it's gutsy, gritty, dirty, hopeful, and alive. Certainly alive. It really is the best and worst of America. If Kerry had said to the New Yorkers \\"you are the heart and soul of America\\" I don't know if he would have won the election but he wouldn't have ticked off 1/2 the population as when he said it to an audience of 'Hollywood Insiders.'<br /><br />But it's not for the weak of heart. It's like having a lifetime subscription to working out at Bally's with Cher and Nicole, and deciding to have 'a quick workout' at the Kronk Gym while visiting Detroit.<br /><br />I love New York. But like all lopsided relationships, I also respect it. \\"Taking a walk in New York\\" (one of the sub chapters) is pretty cool but like all mammoth cities, a couple of blocks the wrong way and . . . .what did we call it in Vietnam . . . well. Forget what we called it. It could be a mistake.<br /><br />Great book. Great city. Let me leave you with one thought, not to denigrate other cities. Do you remember the firemen pouring into WTC moments before they imploded? I do. With tears in my eyes. I don't know if that would have happened in a lot of other places. That's New York.

You know when I was younger there was a terrible aircraft accident in Tenerife. Two 747 Jumbo Jets took the active runway at the same time, colliding about 4000 feet later, one into the other. There were language problems, overworking conditions, stress and obviously visibility problems. But there was a split second when both aircraft took the active runway facing eachother that if any of 2 dozen situations could have occurred, been resolved, not happened . . . well you get the point.<br /><br />So Mr. Baldacci's \\"Split Second\\" is an interesting premise, one of the 25 or 26 basic plots authors have to work with. Inattention while guarding an important character, distraction, momentary 'drifting,' and lives are changed forever. Hell. In ancient Rome or Athens, the guards were asked to take their lives or were put to death. Big issue.<br /><br />I liked Joan Dillinger, Michelle Maxwell and Sean King. I didn't find them cardboard characters. There are those that write \\"See Spot Run\\" novels where the characters are one dimensional. Not so here. Were there Baldacci books I enjoyed more? Yes. \\"The Winner,\\" \\"Simple Truth\\" and \\"Faith\\" come to mind. But I fail to see how \\"Split Second\\" would let you down. 4 Stars. 4 1/2 if I had that opprotunity.

Mr. Parker says that he was surprised at the consecutive years of success that Spenser and his posse have enjoyed. Well. Mr. Parker didn't use the phrase \\"posse\\" although he could. He'd probably have Hawk utter it while they were doing 225 pound bench presses . . . . to warm up and Spenser would (with a straight face) ask Hawk if that was one of the code words of a downtrodden minority that signaled silent resistance and alienation  by the oppressed peoples. And Hawk would finish his 15th rep and say \\"yeah, boss.\\"<br /><br />Thing about Spenser and Hawk is that they fit. And together they are both navigators and soothsayers, bringing us like Mentor and Telemachus and Odysseus on an incredible, never ending voyage.<br /><br />I get a kick out of some of the reviews that say \\"not his best\\" or \\"he's done better,\\" as if we need to compare one Spenser work with a subsequent one. Or an earlier one.<br /><br />It's the work, man. The whole ball of wax. Not making out with Susan in one and being angry with her in another. That's the story.<br /><br />Robert B. Parker, I am convinced, has never just mailed it in, a crime of greed infecting far too many authors who see a cash cow and just, well, mail it in. You know who they are.<br /><br />5 stars.

Let me not incur the wrath of reviewers who say Alexander Dumas' soul lives in the body of Perez-Reverte. He may well but . . .<br /><br />This book was written in 1996, almost ten years ago. We can probably add 2 more years for editing, the red pencil, agents, whatever. So let's say that 14 years have elapsed and during that time, certainly we've come to recognize Perez-Reverte as an extraordinary writer. I put him in the category of George Pelecanos. They don't write the same way but they are both still less than household names. Ms. Steele and Mr. Patterson still have permanent places on the NYT Bestsellers list (the 'why' still eludes me).<br /><br />But have you read \\"The Queen of the South?\\" Fantastic. The visual illusion, the fear, the violence, the currency, the morality, the loyalty . . . the best Perez-Reverte in years, and the others are pretty good.<br /><br />This book reminds me of an agent who says 'you're really popular now . . . you got anything you wrote back aways that we can let out?'<br /><br />So. Is it good. Yes. But it's not what made Perez-Reverte what he is today. That's what I want to read. That's my opinion. He's developed a certain style. It's mysterious. It's filled with description and intrigue. Faithless women. Tangier in Nautical Chart. Honor among thieves. I didn't find it here. 4 stars. Larry Scantlebury	2005-07-15

Of course, there's always the response, 'why?'<br /><br />Here's Jack in Key West, doing what he says he always wants to do, drift, when he hooks up with an ex-cop from New York who gets dead after talking to Jack. And, as only Jack can, he wants to know why.<br /><br />You want to say, leave Jack. Go to Tahoe, Santa Monica, Santa Fe. But don't go looking for the 'why.'<br /><br />We like Jack because he is like Clint Eastwood, the man with no name. Most of the readers critical of 'Tripwire' are reading a book six years late. Of course there are changes. Try to get on a plane without a retinal scan. Life has changed since September 11. But Child is like DeMille. If you pick up The Cathedral or Charm School, obviously the boogie man is dead and life is different. But it's still damn good reading.<br /><br />Mr. Child might want to take a look at authors who left their money makers behind and tilled new soil (Dennis Lehane kissing Patrick and Angie goodbye)  and those that didn't (John Sandford and Lucas Davenport in the Prey series) and decide owhere he wants to go from there.<br /><br />But in the meantime I'm a Jack Reacher fan and I'll read anything Mr. Child writes.

I got into the character of Miles Lord and didn't think he was editorializing about racism . . . anywhere. And I thought that the inability to consider the \\"inside\\" bad guy was a mistake that a normal person would make. The reason that the Romanov conspiracy is odd to us is that it's been kept from public scrutiny for 90 years. But if you study your history and look at the cold war and it's results from the October Revolution, it makes a lot of (common) sense and knowledge.<br /><br />Miles is running for his life a lot and while not tedious, that  got to the point of, 'come on man, WHY are they after you?'<br /><br />A really terrifying novel about Russia today is Martin Cruz-Smith's \\"Wolves Eat Dogs.\\" This is not up to par as that. But I found it enjoyable and worthwhile, and I would read Mr. Berry again. 4 Stars. Larry Scantlebury	2005-07-09

Hmmmm. Let's see. Sneak attack on American soil. Killed thousands of American men and women. Didn't that happen recently?<br /><br />Come on. Books like this don't polarize America. Senator Durbin standing on the Senate floor likening the guards at Gitmo to the Stormtroopers at Dachau and Treblinka and the conditions like the death camps, managing to insult Jews, survivors of the Holocaust, members of the Armed Forces, and, probably today's German woman or man, that's what polarizes America. That's insulting. That man should be censured. What polarizes America is Senator Kerry standing in front of an audience of beautiful movie stars wearing sunglasses at night and producers with TWO cellphones using both at the same time and saying to them, \\"you are the heart and soul of America.\\" That's what polarizes America. That's insulting.<br /><br />Sure it's a safe bet to say President Bush's popular margin of victory wasn't overwhelming. But look at the damn map! The entire center of the country went for the conservatives. Who cares what the French think? THEY CAN'T VOTE.<br /><br />Ann Coulter is over the top. She's a journalist.

US	39425588	R37EEEOPJGSO4O	0670033693	963027451	The Cold Dish: A Novel	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Excellent novel	This is a well crafted mystery involving, on several levels, sadness, retribution, redemption and coming of age. Portions of it reminded me of the works of Donald Harstad, also a Sheriff, and James Lee Burke's Billy Bob Holland character. All these men come from an geography many of us are unfamiliar with and also to a great extent, with relationships that are new to us. Here Sheriff Walt Longmire's friendship with Henry Standing Bear would be the first popular National novel of a \\"Buddy\\" novel with a Native American person, except for my own geographic compatriot Steve Hamilton who writes the Alex McKnight series. McKnight's best friend, you might remember, is Vinnie LeBlanc, an Ojibwa indian.<br /><br />But as Holmes says, 'I digress.' Good story in the far reaches of the west, close to the Little Big Horn massacre and remnants of the Cheyenne Indian Nation. Mellisa, a teenage Native American girl with fetal alcohol syndrome is gang raped by four caucasion High School scoundrels. Light, near 'probationary' sentences for the horrific crime smolder an already tense relationship between the reservation and for lack of a better word, the \\"townies.\\"<br /><br />Great characters in Sheriff Longmire, widowed 4 years earlier, Lucian, the crotchety one-legged former Sheriff who trained Walt, Vic Moretti, the tough as nails Philadelphia woman police officer Walt wants to make Sheriff when he retires, and a lot more. When the first of the 4 young adults is shot and killed from long range by a high powered rifle, all these forces and people come into play.<br /><br />The strength of Craig Johnson's book is the beauty of his writing. He definitely is a gifted author, somewhat like the aforementioned Burke who can write poetically sentences that you just have to stop and read over and over.<br /><br />The second strong point is the character of the characters. They're all different, from Ruby, the grandmother dispatcher trying to master police \\"lingo\\" to Moretti who is highly technically skilled but unable to finish a sentence without an explitive deleted in it.<br /><br />The weak point I think was that some of the dialogue became immature. I just don't see the constant quipping between the two powerful men with gunshot wounds, joking about lunch or suspects in the case. It reminded me, again in parts, of Starsky and Hutch TV movies or Han Solo talking to Chewbaca. It's a small point but I think it detracted from the rawness and the beauty of the effort.<br /><br />An excellent book and worth the time. I hope Mr. Johnson favors us with more. You might want to catch William Landay's debut novel \\"Mission Flats\\" which takes palce in Boston. But \\"Cold Dish\\" is likewise a great first book. 4 stars.

Board of Education as the defining moment of the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement, and, along with that, the uniquely American ideals of equality not only in the philosophic sense, but that and as well in the practical sense.<br /><br />I myself always preferred, for its relentlessness, the Heart of Atlanta case 10 years later in 1964. We would not accept the \\"privacy\\" veil of 'good 'ole boy' corporations as a racist foundary for continued segregation. I mention these two monumental Supreme Court decisions because of what we do. Americans. All of us. We are Americans and we are the center of the world. People get upset with such . . . arrogance. The French believe we're haughty (the French for Heaven's sake!) The British still think of us as 'bloody colonials' and 'damn yanks.' Spain thinks we're overbearing. Nobody really wants to say thank you for the Second World War. But why is that? Not why we are disliked but why are we doing those things like Brown v. Board and Heart of Atlanta?<br /><br />I believe, as I get older now, that we have a covenant with those men and women 229 years ago to do the next right thing.<br /><br />We mess up, make mistakes, really irritate the hell out of people. But we seem to be like a relentless, ever moving tide moving to correct errors, right wrongs, uncover buried mistakes. A court in Mississippi today convicted a man involved with the killings of three civil rights workers 40 years ago. Today in Mississippi justice was found for the families of three deceased students. Wrongs were righted.<br /><br />We're different. We built the machinery, yes in 1776, to let men and women live in safety, in health, in equality, in the practice of devotion to their God, to own guns, and to speak freely. And somehow, two centuries later, we're still doing it.<br /><br />And it all starts in 1776. Without 1776, 'We hold these truths to be self evident, THAT ALL MEN AND WOMEN ARE CREATED EQUAL, are words that never get spoken. This is a great book. Mr. McCullough again, out does himself.

When I saw the title I briefly thought of the searing trial movie \\"True Believer\\" but . . . . wasn't that either.<br /><br />This is a nice little love story. You don't have to work at it. It's not irritating as a James Patterson cereal book is nor as complicated as LeCarre. Or preachy like Crichton. Or bloody like Connolly. It's real simple. If you feel in the mood for the love story of the cynical Jeremy Marsh leaving the trappings of NYC to go to Boone Creek to woo the beautiful girl almost in the clutches of the town . . . whoops, I'm giving you the whole book.<br /><br />Nice read. 4 stars.

But it struck me as I read Mermaid that we learn so much as children that we can't use. See what I mean? We used to think what we learned was wrong but it's not that it was wrong. It just had a \\"do not use after\\" label on it that we ignored. And we tried to apply past lessons of other people to the present situation with different people. There's no real answer. Is marriage passion or comfort? Are they mutually exclusive theories? I think that they're not. But by the same token, you fall off a lot of bicycles figuring out how to ride a two wheeler. I think Monk Kidd knows it all comes down to one thing: love.<br /><br />This book resonates with the extraordianary Flannery O'Connor taken from us far too soon. But I don't mean there's a similarity necessarily, but the wrestling match, the struggle continues. O'Connor was a Catholic woman entrenched in her faith and she wrestled with, as does Monk Kidd, love.<br /><br />That's what this book is about. Love. Mom. Dad. Mom and Dad. Husband. Wife. And, as Robert Plante wailed for LZ, \\"the Ramblin' Man,\\" herein in Monk's clothing.<br /><br />Mysticicm like John Connolly and James Lee Burke without the violence and bloodshed.

Landay writes \\"There is a sloping trail that leads from the house through the verdant gloom of the pine woods and emerges into the bright reflecting light of the water's edge.\\" And a few pages later \\"It's a magical time of year, late October, early November . . . and the flashbursts of red foliage is over . . . and the lake is ours alone.\\" These in the first 20 pages. He brings you there and plays a little music in your head while he escorts you around the Maine and Boston landscape. His descriptions become an additional character.<br /><br />Then there is the subtle conectiveness of the story and the sub stories. Their relationship to eachother. The return of the moral consequences of your acts. You know there's going to be a connection with the killing in the Kilmarnock Pub. And you have a pretty good feeling you're not going to know what it is for several hundred pages.<br /><br />What is hard perhaps impossible to pick up on is the fable of the sins of the father and more than that, what we had set in motion yesterday never completely disappears. It repeats on us.<br /><br />So we don't really catch the meaning of Annie turning down her legacy, deying her father and marrying the wandering Claude. And Claude's relationship with Ben. And Ben's superficial relationship with Diane. See it's all a series of surfaces and sub surfaces. Landay paints a masterpiece, but wait. There's a painting beneath that. And hold on a minute, there's one beneath that as well.<br /><br />An Assistant District Attorney is murdered in Maine, the jurisdiction of Chief Ben Thurman, son of Chief Claude Thurman. But it's not that simple. The search for the killer by the arrogant Boston PD is resisted by Ben.

My point was how can you say (to my Dad) that their music stinks (true observation deleted) when they sold 40 million albums? He smiled.<br /><br />I still see that smile, years later, when I read James Patterson because ultimately, people buy this stuff because he has a name. It's Patterson, like in the Bond movies, James Patterson. If the criteria for Amazon reviews contained a segment for marketing, he would get 25 stars.<br /><br />And I want to say to the readers, (as my Father said 'have you heard of Mozart, Bach, Sibellius, Dvorak, Tchaikovsky, Beethoven, Schuman?') have you heard of Perez-Reverte, Pelecanos, George, Crais, Lehane, or the new guys on the block like Landay and Hamilton? How about Alan Furst or Beevor or Hastings?<br /><br />You waste your time, you waste your money. Mr. Patterson wrote extremely good books 15 years ago. He doesn't choose to any more. The plots are weak, the evil comical, and like the horrific \\"Bird\\" stories, there are characters whom you have no idea how they got there saying things that don't make any sense. The dialogue has no credibility.<br /><br />1 star. Larry Scantlebury	2005-06-20

I found the descriptions of where 'we were' to be sparse, almost nonexistent. Maybe they're in other novels. Boston is a helluva city. Read Spenser. Boston is like a fifth character, another subplot. You're there, man.<br /><br />One reviewer commented that Clevenger appeared to be on the phone all the time. That was my read as well.<br /><br />I recognize that Kellerman and White have made the forensic psychiatric murder milieu a virtual cottage industry. Maybe that's my problem. I don't get into it. Seems too unbelivable. All those patients. All those murders. Whatever.<br /><br />So my take was it was tedious, I didn't \\"feel\\" the environment, and I found the tricking of guilty people to be, incredible. As in not credible. 2 stars.

It's not supposed to be. Of course it's not like . . . It's what Mr. Parker does here. Make no mistake. This might be one of the best novels you read this year. Certainly the best western. And it's not Spenser and there's no Sunny Randall. And Susan, thank God, didn't get the stage out of St. Louis.<br /><br />There are some films that capture a certain genre or time. Duvall and Costner put one together in \\"Open Range.\\" Brilliant movie. It's about us. It's really where we came from. You take Boston and Philly and New York 200 years ago, and they're just London moved 3000 miles to their west. But the West, our West, the real 'west' in the 1880's, that's America, what we stole, what we made, what we built, our courage, our loyalty, our bad and our good, our cowardice, and here with Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch, our laws.<br /><br />Virgil is the lawman. Parker lets us picture him as stringy, tough, committed to the law. And Hitch hooks up with him almost on a chance encounter when outnumbered by 8 teamsters about to kill Cole, he tells Marshall Cole, \\"I got your back.\\"<br /><br />I only found one obvious Spenserism. It's early on (page 17)  when Cole gets asked by hemming and hawing Aldermen to bring law and order to Appaloosa. He asks his right hand man Hitch who by now has been with Cole for more than a decade if they should go? Hitch says, \\"It's what we do\\" and Cole says \\"Yes it is.\\" Sounds an awful lot like Spenser and Hawk talking in a Bar on Commonwealth Avenue in Boston.<br /><br />But it's a brilliant western. Parker's got the dialogue down to a science. Evil cattle baron, the prostitute with the heart of gold, the guns for hire, the evil girlfriend. I couldn't put it down. I didn't put it down. Excellent stuff. 5 Stars. Larry Scantlebury	2005-06-15

Absolutely true. On my 'About You' area, there's an ad box for 'people who read ____ also read ____ .' This little icon had listed Child in there for probably two months. Finally I gave up and got \\"The Enemy\\" and I've been hooked ever since.<br /><br />I'm not sure what the attraction is. Certainly it's well written stuff. Complicated. Good dialogue. Violent. Lot's of great retribution. A little bit of redemption now and again.<br /><br />Jack Reacher is a West Point man with thirteen years in the Army, 'riffed' . . .  reduction in force . . . after the budget cut backs under Bush the Ist and Clinton (\\"Ahhh did not have sex with that womin!\\"). Anyhow Reacher is cut loose.<br /><br />That's probably the first of very few flaws that I find. It's a small point, liking eating a great meal but after you have a little bit of food caught in your gum. He's West Point. He's a killing machine. He's been in combat. His success rate as a Military Police (MP) investigator is sky high. He is deep selected for Major, a good Field Grade position enroute to Lieutenant Colonel and Colonel; He's got an engineering degree from one of the toughest schools in the world. Makes the Brits at Sandhurst look like they're in a Teachers College in Ohio.<br /><br />Not a big point. But then he wanders the earth, like Cain in Kung Fu from the abominable '60's. See, Mr. Child was a screenwriter so some of this Sergio Leone stuff of the vagrant gunfighter rolling into town makes sense. But no shoes, no shirt, no service . . . like the sign says, don't bother coming in.<br /><br />So I don't have a problem with the plotting. The plots are tight and well constructed. Evil guys; some of them connected to the/a government; a trusted compatriot who is not as fearless or smart as Jack; a hot chick who sometimes lives, sometimes dies, makes out with Reacher but never sticks around. I just fumble around with how he got there. Walking the earth for truth and justice is the old Billy Jack theme. The '60's died. Thank God.<br /><br />OK. Lest I be misunderstood. This is great reading. It's fun, not necessarily funny but wry, and as I said, who minds when evil people get the stuff kicked out of them?<br /><br />Jack ends up in Margrave, Georgia outside of 'Lanta, and meets Roscoe and Finlay, Roscoe being the hot police officer who falls for Reacher (and likewise) and Finlay being the retired back to work Boston detective transferred by chance, like Reacher, to Margrave.<br /><br />Counterfieting's the problem, which brings Jack's older brother, Joe, a brilliant Treasury Agent to Margrave also. Unexpectedly. The two brothers don't stay in touch. Rather they are both solo performers in their own worlds. Joe more cerebral; Jack more over the edge. Issues of loyalty arise. Putting adolescent responsibilities in order. Maintaining your integrity. And yes, righting wrongs.<br /><br />Written in the complicated first person but highly descriptive and tight nonetheless.<br /><br />Great stuff. The best \\"rainy day - airport - the spouuse is out of town I need to kill three days\\" read you'll get. Larry Scantlebury. 5 starsthere.

If you don't like Jack Reacher, you're in the wrong genre of book. You should go back to the old Oprah Lists. Nothing wrong with Oprah. Don't get me wrong. But Reacher's never going to be on her list. And Lee Child will never be on her show.<br /><br />Jack Reacher is the solitary figure that can't be tied down. To a woman, although he misses them; to a career, although he was a top flight violent crimes investigator for the Army, and certainly not to a job.<br /><br />Here he's in Boston which he describes as an 8 day town. 8 days before it begins to wear on you and you have to move on. And he bumps into someone on the street. Wealthy guy. Well dressed stepping into a limo. Just walking out of Symphony Hall. They stare at eachother. The reason why it was a staring contest is because the guy Reacher sees died ten years ago. Reacher knew that. He's the one that put him down.<br /><br />So. More shadowy agencies and off the books missions. Reacher infiltrates a drug dealer's casa, he becomes involved with an attractive government agent. You know that's going to happen. And he wrestles with doing the right thing, righting wrongs, and keeping his code.<br /><br />Excellent stuff. Child tells a great story. Hope he keeps it up. Reacher's great. 5 Stars.

The prose is tight, the action swift, the confusion greater as the plot unfolds than in the beginning, and we really don't want Jack Taylor to have that next drink or next line or next joint. Because we know what it does. Because we know what it does to him. Because he knows what it does to him.<br /><br />The search for the Magdelene murders-martyrs-perps might be pandering in say Chicago or New York, but it sure makes sense in Galway. And as Jack searches deeper he begins to appreciate .and share with us its horrors.<br /><br />I have no problem with the writing. Excellent. Taylor beating on his mother gets tiresome. The relationship he has with Father Malachy reminds me of Clint Eastwood's Frankie Dunn, but of course Jack Taylor would run over the Pastor and his mother if he had the chance. Frankie Dunn wouldn't.<br /><br />Good writing. Sad story. I guess Jack Taylor and Ken Bruen have a niche in writing about drunks. Funny thing is, they usually die. 5 stars.

This is why reading is so much fun. You can have your starting lineup, say Parker, George, Ambrose, Bevor, Pelecanos, and then you literally stumble onto a Child, a Lethem, and a Dibdin.<br /><br />I felt I was reading a travelogue of a place I had never been to and simultaneously meeting this quiet, unassuming detective, Aurelio Zen (what a great name), all too or very human, with all  the frailties of a real human even down to the cigarettes, all along and on a canvas of murder most foul.<br /><br />I can't wait for the rest.

No doubt he will go down as an icon if not THE icon of this genre for the last 40 years. And actors have cut their teeth, prolonged careers, strut their hour upon the stage \\"walking the walk\\" of LeCarre characters. Connery comes to mind. The lovely Michelle Pfeiffer. Of course Alec Guiness and Richard Burton. The lesser known but equally accomplished Ian Bannen and Ian Richardson. Early appearances by Alan Rickman and Patrick Stewart. So he's 'made his bones.' He's safe. And like any great hitter, he can be forgiven for going 0 for 4 occasionally. \\"Absolute Friends\\" is one of those days.<br /><br />I'm tired of aging radicals. You were found wanting then, and now. I'm tired of replaying the war in Vietnam, for example. I'm tired of interviews with ancient leaders from a different time who cry. I'm exhausted by Michael Moore, as if I would ever look to Hollywood to teach me ANYTHING. I'm tired of successful people in one career, songwriters, actors, writers, lawyers, rappers, who choose another field from which to pontificate to me what's wrong with my country. Hell. I've been to England 60-70 times. I'm still trying to find a decent shower stall.<br /><br />And I'm tired of John LeCarre's rants. Dennis Miller got bumped off of TV. George Carlin does a show at the Toledo Holiday Inn every two years. Rants are passe. Righteous indignation is left to aging baseball players on ESPN over missed third strikes. I struggled with this book. It was very well written. It was also exceedingly boring. It went nowhere. The cold war is over. You have to move on. 3 stars. Larry Scantlebury	2005-06-05

You know there was so much harm done by the Enron implosion that albeit thousands of miles away and NOT involving sex crimes, murder or prohibited arms sales, it still captured the attention of the liberal television news journalists of CBS, NBC and ABC (there are several oxymorons there if you care to read it again) on the east coast.<br /><br />Thousands of people were harmed, families were crushed, names you never heard had to file Chapter 7. Kids on their way to UT and UM ended up working on the assembly lines. Plans that boys and girls of 19 and 20 thirty-five years earlier had worked for were dashed. And there was no sex drugs or rock 'n roll. Just greed and immorality of a number of people.<br /><br />So Eichenwald's election to tell a biased story, that is that while some of these guys (his sources no doubt) were at the top but they knew nothing, has a 'Nuremburg defense' feel to it.<br /><br />Nothing's worse than reading a work that promises to be accurate and truthful and feeling 'wow, this sure sounds like . . .well, it sounds unbelievable.'<br /><br />Most of us with 1/2 a brain who work in offices know or suspect who is doing what to whom. And as we ascend the corporate ladder, we know more, suspect more, and have a fiduciary responsibility to protect those beneath us by asking the hard questions and taking action. In the law, we have been given notice of bad acts.<br /><br />Eichenwald would have us believe that his sources didn't know anything.<br /><br />I couldn't believe that. I felt he was being untruthful with me, the reader. That deflated the book for me as little more than tabloid journalism. 3 stars. Larry Scantlebury	2005-06-05

I found that it spent all of its time on the characters, who were stereotyped and who should be more irritated than the reader, that it pandered to issues both current and past in an effort to generate a 'lifetime channel' view of the simplicity of humans, and finally it nearly mocked the efforts of millions to target the flaws of a few.<br /><br />OK. I recognize that to comment negatively on the enormously complex topics of racism and anti semitic behavior is foolish, certainly wrong, and insensitive. The WWII German treatment of its Jewish citizens is so horrific that it deserves solitary, focused treatment. Not third rate actors in a fourth rate story. I don't mean to do that here.<br /><br />First of all, Mr. Robbins has written enormously popular novels. For what it's worth, I have given them 5 stars as have many others. To write historical fiction is a difficult task. If you stick to just the facts, you've just written another treatise, frequently aloof, often sacrificing the human pathos for statistics. On the other hand, you can change the facts and end up being accused of rewriting history. Also a blunder of mammoth proportions.<br /><br />Here Mr. Robbins leaves the brilliance of his former trilogy about Stalingrad, Kursk and Berlin, and writes singularly of two characters, Joe Amos, an educated African American truck driver bringing supplies from the chaos of Omaha Beach to the front lines, and Rabbi Ben Kahn, struggling with his hatred of himself and the lives he took in the First World War and searching for his son, who unbeknownst to him has become a prominent black marketeer in occupied Paris. That's it. That's the story. Nothing more than that.<br /><br />Was there racism in 1944? Yes. Hell. There's racism now. It's the most debilitating problem that this nation faces. But I thought that we applauded the universal effort of the battle of good over evil in 1942, 43, 44, and 45? I thought that when Brokaw wrote that 'this was the greatest generation ever' he was talking about everyone. Now I read Robbins and I find that the officers at Omaha in charge of the enormously complex supply train to ensure that the boys on the front line were never denied bullets, band aids, gasoline, mail and food, were for the most part racist, frequently willing to take bribes, and that the enlisted men Joe Amos and others were taking to St. Lo and beyond were overtly ignorant pigs, and that the Uniform Code of Military Justice had a set of white rules and a set of black rules. Frankly, I thought it pandered, trying to raise issues that had been addressed, were addressed, were still seeking resolution, that good men and women deal with every day, and that it was done just to get a reaction.<br /><br />Chaplain Ben Kahn? Good man. But I wanted the history of how we supplied the war effort. That's what I thought Robbins promised me. That's what I thought the book was about. In the other trilogy, the most important character was the war, the hideous, immoral, evil effort of the two psychopaths, Hitler and Stalin. The human story was a distant second. Here we spend hundreds of pages dealing with Chaplain Kahn's post traumatic stress.<br /><br />It took an effort to finish this book. Important issues? Most assuredly. Other authors frequently examine them in focused writing. \\"A Death in Vienna\\" for a fictional view. \\"Hitler's Willing Accomplices\\" for a non fiction view. But \\"Liberation Road\\" is misleading in the context of what Mr. Robbins told us he was going to write about. 2 stars. Larry Scantlebury1942, 43, 44, and 45?

It's well researched as to changing venue and as always, the dialogue is crisp, to the point, and doesn't pander to humor or overt macho friendship.<br /><br />Jack Reacher does certain things well. As I have mentioned in the past, he's a throwback to the 60's insofar as his similarity to Clint Eastwood in the 'Dirty Harry' Series and McQueen in 'Bullit.' Yet Reacher is his own man, investigating, analyzing, discussing options and seeking justice. Many times it's his own justice for which there is rare 'look the other way' tendencies from the pompous government agencies. Here it's a little different in his dealings with the Secret Service, sworn to protect the President and in this case, the vice-President with their lives.<br /><br />There's also usually a beautiful woman present, and here it's M.E., brother Joe's old girlfriend. M.E. has risen in the ranks of the Secret Service and doubting the efficiency of her team, wants to see if an \\"outsider\\" can penetrate the protection that they have created for the vice-President. Reacher takes the job and consults with an old friend from his military days, Frances Neagley, also hot, also a stone cold killer.<br /><br />What M.E. hasn't told Reacher is that in the first place, the drills against her team protecting the VP aren't necessarily practice. Several potential attempts have been made against the new VP. Additionally, she has never resolved her feelings toward Joe, now deceased, and wants to explain, discuss and explore them with Reacher. Maybe.<br /><br />One of my favorites. As always, Mr. Child has a good plot, good characters and good action. And a great hero. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury	2005-05-29

I'm not sure if it's Dirty Harry Callahan or the star of \\"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly,\\" but it's something like that.<br /><br />This is an excellent Jack Reacher novel because it brings us back to the time when he was an MP in the Army. Or as we called them, one of the \\"P's.\\" He's faced with the ususal Jack Reacher enigma, the unsolveable crime, the dearth (if any) of clues, the presence of ignorant authority, frequently the FBI but here a good old field grade Colonel will do, and an 'easy on the eyes' woman. And of course, you know he's going to kick some major butt. Deservingly so, I might add.<br /><br />Dead Generals, gays in the service, Vietnam backlash, racism, women in the service, psyops, all these things come to bear on Reacher and his friends. Well. Friend. Nice side trip to Paris, good time spent with brother Joe and terminally ill Mom.<br /><br />Definitely worth the effort. If you're a Jack Reacher fan you'll love this. I hope Lee Child doesn't burn himself out.<br /><br />Oh. How about this? The lonely vigilante walking the United States with a sense of justice and an attitude?

Ms. Lamott seems uncertain as to what she is going to say and I am then left with uncertainty as to what she said. Or why. Writing about Christ and his teenage years is something I would expect from George Carlin or Moore. I get the feeling that Ms. Lamott wanted to touch on everything that might pull in a few extra readers.

This is, like all Stephen White endeavors, darn good writing. That's why I give it 4 stars. The plot's complicated and fairly seamless. There's a lot going on. The characters have enough wit, charm, humor and humanity, albeit in sparse episodes, to make most of them interesting. And the ending is a surprise. Well. Maybe 'unanticipated' is a better word.<br /><br />The problem is Dr. Alan Gregory. To paraphrase a famous question, \\"how do I love myself? Let me count the ways.\\" Is there a hero more full of himself? I can't think of one.<br /><br />There is any number of central characters that you can really dislike. Marlowe himself wasn't really all that pleasant but if you really want unpleasantness, try on Jack Taylor in \\"The Guards\\" or \\"The Killing of the Tinkers.\\" If you really want to spend some time under the rock, reading any of Crumley's Milo Milodragovitch novels will make your skin clammy and leave you searching for antacid.<br /><br />Gregory on the other hand is irritating. At least I find him so. Real irritating. It's hard to like him. He has a list of friends that are as diverse as the cast of 'The Rocky Horror Show,' he goes on weekends with other men's wives but every one else (particularly spouses) is cool with it because he's so cool, and he's on  a first name basis with the owners of every eatery in Boulder preparing wonderful, groovy food from countries not even members of the UN yet. Boulder must be heaven. It makes Ann Arbor and Brentwood look like emotional ghettos.<br /><br />But the real irritating point is that Gregory's patients are all on the periphery of some horrific crime incolving chemicals and children. His patients are not the 'perps' as Sam Purdy would say, but boy, they sure know something bad. And Dr. Alan can't tell anyone because of the . . .

Shades of Len Deighton's 'Ipcress File,' DeMille's 'Charm School' and of course the grand master, LeCarre and his 'Russia House' or 'The Spy . . .'<br /><br />\\"Prince of Fire\\" amplifies its complexity by Silva asking hard questions on racism and xenophobia and of course, genocide. I suspect that each generation is better off and better tooled to deal with the horrors and ignorance of racism than the preceding one. We can hope. We should not forget that the predetermination of a person's value as a human has terrible consequences in every instance, and that it was only a thousand years ago that women in Europe frequently went unnamed, that in our own country we had slavery 150 years ago and didn't give the right to vote to minorities until only a few score of years ago. This is but a drop in the bucket of time.<br /><br />Gabriel Allon, the reluctant spy-assassin-art restorer is blown out of his cover as an art restorer in Venice.<br /><br />Silva again does an amazing job in his description of sight and sound and smell, such that you can smell the onions in the lamb cooking in an eatery and hear the rusty locks on an ancient elevator and see a friendly goat nuzzling an old Palestinian fighter while Gabriel and his colleague wait across a dusty square out of respect.<br /><br />That we still fight the fight or are an audience for the fight being fought doesn't change anything. What does become symbolic is the importance of the 'why.' Silva again offers vivid explanations but at some point in \\"Prince of Fire\\" he tells the story from both sides. He does not nullify his allegiances; he does however raise the question 'when' as in when will enough be enough?<br /><br />Gabriel is brought out of hiding to track the son of a son of a son who is a terrorist par excellance, (Asad and Sabri el Khalifa are the grandfather and father) and who counts his descendancy from the 1930's, Arafat and the present.<br /><br />A complicated, brilliant novel with surprising twists and sudden changes. It stands on it's own although you might want to read 'A Death in Vienna' first for some background. Generally, though, you can dig right in. 5 Stars.

Once the series caught on with a 'I'll follow him anywhere' mentality of a several 100,000 reader fan base, Parker like the old Soviet news agency Tass spent subsequent years trying to purge the memory of the readers from some of the facts he had earlier released. Otherwise the seventy five year old hero with his seventy five year old lover and his seventy five year old friends becomes unintentionally comical.<br /><br />Similarly, Crais created a courageous, heroic, clown in the person of Elvis Cole. Don't knock it. It worked and \\"Sunset,\\" \\"Monkey's Raincoat,\\" and L.A. Requiem\\" are three of the finest mysteries written in the last 25 years. But, and it's a big but, it has a limited 1/2 life. Arthur Miller wrote \\"everyone loves a kidder. But no one wants to lend him money.\\" And for this reader (and I'll always read Crais) the wisecracks become predictable. The humor is almost television scripted. The moronic bad-guy bodyguards speak only to set up the zingers of Cole. The goose-stepping LAPD denying Cole evidence just so he can tell them what idiots they are.<br /><br />He is funny. So is the 'vette. So is the Mickey Mouse clock. It's just tiring. THERE'S ONLY SO MANY FUNNY THINGS YOU CAN PUT INTO A MURDER MYSTERY.<br /><br />What's happening here and in \\"The Last Detective\\" is (granted this is some conjecture) giving Joe and Elvis some depth. Kudos again to Lehane who leaves Angie and Patrick and starts a whole new venture because they've done it all. And now we have a less comedic Elvis and a more insightful Joe. I think it's great and I applaud Robert Crais.<br /><br />Kelly Diaz calls Cole up at 4 in the a.m. to tell him she might have found the body of Cole's father whom he has searched for most of his life.<br /><br />Nice seamless bouncing back and forth between the past and the present. Nice descriptiveness of the humanity (or lack of it) of the characters in the past. Again, nice seamlessness in the traversing from the 1st person to the 3rd person and back. Nice re-introduction of Starkey and we know she'll be back and, she didn't even start out in a Cole novel (see \\"Demolition Angel.\\")<br /><br />Good twists. I thought the ending was a bit rushed but all in all, fairly powerful. Thomas Wolfe said 'you can never go home' but for most of us we at least have a recollection of somewhere that was a home. Elvis is still looking for that. Good story. Nicely done. 5 stars. Larry Scantleburyand forth between the past and the present.

I don't understand it since I am a recent Michigander. I'm not even certain what a \\"michigander\\" is. I hope it's not anything bad.<br /><br />The point is that more than Spenser, more than Joe Pike, more than Jack Taylor, Stone Barrington is ONLY formula driven. All the stories (I think there are ten of them) are the same. There's just no difference here. Or maybe it's like the old legal commentary on two juxtaposed cases. There's a difference . . . without a distinction.<br /><br />Dinner at a posh Manhattan eatery. Expensive wine. Gay repartee with the head of the Detective Precinct Dino, enter a beautiful woman, oh, I forgot, more gay repartee with Elaine, OK, then the hot woman whom Stone will be  . . . ahhhh . . . . having relations with 60-65 pages later, Stone's boss Bill Eggers from the firm(...) More sex. More money.<br /><br />Now if this bothers you (see multiple \\"I've had enough\\" reviews) then Mr. Woods is not your cup of tea . . . or Cabernet. It doesn't bother me and I like it. Stone's kind of an extremely well coifed but morally sleazy James Bond. It's kind of an 'acceptable' play on the 70's.<br /><br />Dino is fun. The arrival-departure of Arrington's fun. Joan is kind of like Richard Janssen's secretary in the Richard Diamond series (Mary Tyler Moore) or the Mike Hammer series. You know where you're going. It's an OK trip. What? You don't watch an old Chuck Norris or Sly Stone movie at night when the kids go to bed? Come on. You're being as arrogant as Mr. Woods.<br /><br />It ain't Tolstoy.

You could even say both \\"do unto others\\" or worse, \\"love your neighbor as yourself\\" appears without solicitation. Here's my response to those who criticize 'self deception' for those reasons.<br /><br />So what?<br /><br />The fact is that we are frequently, unintentionally, racist, sexist, ageist, and homophobic. If there's something that's out there that makes us recognize that (I'm going to say \\"recognize;\\" Changing is up to you) bring it on.<br /><br />We reviewed a book a few months ago, \\"Younger Next Year,\\" about hitting fifty and keeping on exercising, being faithful and eating nutritionally. Holy Cow. The protest over the simplicity of a style of living. If it works for you, do it. What do you have to lose?<br /><br />Self Deception asks you to analyze those intimate and working relationships you have and to juxtapose how you see those people (with whom you are speaking) with how you see yourself. Do you give them the same right to pursue happiness, comfort , safety and human warmth that you give yourself? Do you acknowledge that they have the same fears and anxieties that you do?<br /><br />I use Self Deception as a secondary text in a Leadership course. Yeah.

Corey makes his appearance in Nelson DeMille's \\"The Lion's Game\\" and then really hits the floor running in the recent \\"Nightfall.\\" And there are several similarities between the two cynical, humorous and hard boiled detectives. Both matured under the aegis of a wartime or at least a combat Army; both are Irish, enjoy Scotch, Catholic, aficionados (without the promiscuity) of the ladies, and heavily distinguished with their own barnacles on the ship of life.<br /><br />Certainly Corey is one of my favorites but I think I prefer Drummond precisely for his humanity. Spenser hasn't made a mistake since 1976; Elvis Cole makes them occasionally but he tries VERY hard not to make them and he's very apologetic. But Sean Drummond makes them all the time, feels very aware he's made them, and sometimes he feels badly and sometimes he doesn't care. He is, inotherwords, more like us than Spenser or Cole or for that matter, all the rest.<br /><br />Here he's asked to consult in a horrific multiple murder in McClean Virginia. Like the Palatine Illinois murders of 10-12 years ago, a whole house is taken out in a professional mob-like execution. Pay attention here because just who has asked Sean to participate in the investigation isn't all that clear initially.<br /><br />Mr. Haig weaves a far-fetched plot of a governemnt being held hostage but he does a very adroit job of making it believable. Jennifer Margold is the lovely FBI Behavioral Specialist teamed up with Sean, who travels from contempt to communication to attraction. Will she? Will he? Can they find time while the bodies are piling up?<br /><br />Certainly their relationship is well plotted by Mr. Haig, and you feel, while not apprehensive, with a heightened sense of awareness. And then there's Jason Barnes, son of a Federal Judge rejected for an appointment to the Supremes, who has the second shift of the Secret Service protective unit at the site of the murders, and who suddenly winds up missing?<br /><br />This is the best of the Haig novels I have read so far. With each one he hones his skills further. The dialogue is witty and fast paced and realistic; the plot is complex but made believable by Mr. Haig's descriptive prowess; there are several twists you don't see coming and several facts that are strewn about for you that don't arise again until the last few pages.<br /><br />Good stuff. 5 stars.

Alex goes to comfort her and, well I guess he does. And so starts \\"Ice Run,\\" Alex having fallen for the attractive Constable.<br /><br />But it would take someone of lesser intellect than the characters, and ANY reader, to note that Natalie doesn't feel the same way. This is not like Tangier in \\"The Nautical Chart\\" or Mattie in \\"Body heat.\\" She's not using our favorite retired Motor City Detective. She's just . . . . not all there. There is something about her that is incomplete and Mr. Hamilton presents this nicely. He tells us that 'she has some serious issues'  and he'll tell us in a couple of hundred pages what they are. Unfortunately Alex doesn't hear that or can't put it together so he stumbles around for what seems the whole winter.<br /><br />He gets caught up in the periphery of her life, he takes another terrible beating, and he immerses himself in the ghostly world of family secrets.<br /><br />This is a well written book and I gladly feel it is of 5 star caliber. I think I would like more of Vinnie in the 7th selection. The two blood brothers play off of eachother well, alright, somewhat like Hawk and Spenser and Elvis and Joe. But there's nothing wrong with that. Sometimes you get a more dimensional view of the main ingredients through the eyes of a partner. In this genre, that's probably not so with a girlfriend.<br /><br />Well written; nice twists; again an almost James Dickey - like description of the wilderness. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury	2005-04-24

This is perhaps the best Pelecanos I have read. I picked up my first one, \\"Right as Rain\\" and wrote a review in late March of 2002. My feelings remain the same. Pelecanos, better that Lehane, better than Lee Burke, is able to immerse himself in the impoverished, where hope is smothered in despair and inspiration is watching the Lifetime Channel where a story with third rate actors may be worse than the one you're living.<br /><br />Meet Lorenzo Brown, a teenage enforcer for a street gang until he's busted for his third felony and does eight years of hard time. Or as George P. might put it, he does 8 on a dime. Lorenzo Brown, the dogman, is the most interesting character I have met in a couple of years. He desperately wants to stay straight. He knows his next trip to the joint will kill him, and he's too old to run in the game now. But there's more. There's his humility and gratitude. He is, OK, don't laugh, Dismas, the good thief.<br /><br />He takes care of his dog, Jasmine, and as he walks around the grey neighborhoods of Washington DC, he cleans up after his dog. And the neighborhood tough 'gangstas' laugh at him and toss jibes at him. Funny thing is, he's still as tough as a nail and just as fearless as he was when he was 15. He just knows the seduction of the game is just that, a seduction.<br /><br />Juxtaposed against that is Rachel Lopez. Whew. She is the real deal. She's his PO, whom he has to report to to drop a specimen once in awhile, who reports on his rehabilitation. Trouble with Rachel is that she's losing it to the streets, men and alcohol, drifting away from the mother ship a little further each night.<br /><br />Lorenzo the criminal trying to go straight, inadvertantly, has become the mentor to the Probation Officer.<br /><br />How the two of them help each other is the story. Oh, there's a gang war, police are involved, there are some secondary and tertiary plots, some nice references to other characters in other books, but the long and the short of it is is that it's a story solely about retribution and redemption, in that order.<br /><br />The dialogue is exceptional. It's as if you are at the street corner listening to the brothers talk about the man, a fly on the wall of life. A very hard life where a mistake at the age of 10 might strangle you at 16.<br /><br />You must read this one. 5 stars.

Interesting title; interesting cover. That was about as far as it went. I became so tired of Jimmy Parisi talking to himself, repeatedly, his black dog, his girlfriend's death years ago, his nearly racist tirades, his friend Doc, Red, his wife, his son's depresssion, his depression, I wanted to kill myself.<br /><br />Too many problems. On top of all of this, a serial killer who drains blood (a little Starsky and Hutch, no?) and then additionally, tortured animals. It's almost as though, how can I say this? It's almost as though Mr. Laird has lined up any number of plots and checks them off as he covers them. Good father who wasn't there for his son; good father whose wife died suddenly and he struggled on courageously; good cop who loses his mentor to retirement and it's too much to tell him how much he misses him. But none of those issues grabbed me, because they were superficially raised and then put away. I would think if one or two or three of those issues were addressed and then really examined and resolved over 20 or 25 chapters, it would have been more satisfying.<br /><br />Finally, there is any number of diatribes about Catholics. Being anti-catholic is one thing; it's America. Have you listened to Michael Moore lately? But to be malicious and spiteful in your attacks, not very sporting, eh mate? I gave it 3 stars because of the superlative physical descriptions of one of the greatest cities in America. But Jimmy Parisi ain't no Spenser. Not yet. But I will read Mr. Laird again.

It is: Bad stuff sells!!! Good stuff . . . .  \\"put it on page 17 Charley, next to the power tool ads.\\"<br /><br />So David Brooks is a loser from the outset. Imagine a concept that things are pretty good? The guile of him. Where did he get the guts to publish such tripe? Who the heck is he to tell us that America is a pretty cool and funny place to grow up in?<br /><br />I have to believe that every one in America at sometime in the next couple of weeks ought to get down on their knees and thank the Lord, the Higher Power, Ra the Sun God, the Number 22 bus in Chicago, whomever, for having been born or having emigrated to America. To take a shower every morning. To pay too much at the gas pump but have great highways to use the SUV on. To have 78 channels. To watch the Yankees and The Red Sox. To go to Temple-Mosque-Church on the weekend. To be able to have therapy and diets. To have TV commercials that walk the tightrope between being wildly funny and wildly stupid and nearly half the time offensive (incontinence before dinner is not something I want to consider).<br /><br />I like David Brooks.

I think that \\"The Guards\\" was a better novel than this one but even more so \\"Blitz\\" and \\"The White Trilogy,\\" about whom Keegan makes frequent reference, were better.<br /><br />The addictions of Jack Taylor make the reader uncomfortable, far more than say an angry Harry Bosch or an \\"under the rock\\" novel by James Crumley. But then again, Ken Bruen intends that result.<br /><br />I felt a little uncomfortable with the continued references to George Pelecanos. Possibly this is because \\"Tinkers\\" is structured so similarly. What with the continued references to sports, albeit Irish sports, and rock 'n roll, it feels like a Pelecanos novel.<br /><br />But if it's structured that way, it makes Pelecanos sound like a Nancy Drew mystery writer. Jack is dark, exceeded in this reviewer's recollection only by the aformentioned Crumley.<br /><br />Notwithstanding any of that, it's brilliant writing and recommended for both Bruen and mystery fans generally.

But then Hamilton's real strength isn't that but rather his poetic description of the forest, in many places along the UP still untouched, the cold, nature, the sky and the solitude. He's a little bit of James Dickey and James Lee Burke, who write of the south, while at the same time peppering the reader with the quips and glibness of Parker and Crais. A difficult task considering the solemnity of the forest and the comedic qualities of Alex and Vinnie. But Hamilton keeps Alex's tongue in check when he's painting his canvas.<br /><br />The plot is fairly pedestrian. Here we have the woman in distress and the traumatized hero, Alex McKnight 'volunteered' to help her. Then you have the contiguous sanctity of the Native American culture that Detroit born Alex didn't grow up with, but respects and in many ways, embraces.<br /><br />Someone is selling designer drugs on the Reservation, and Alex and his friend Vinnie LeBlanc wonder if the two events, the girl in distress and her subsequent disappearance, are related to the drug traffic. And then there's the winter.<br /><br />Hamilton describes it so well you may want to click the heat in your crib up a notch. Beautiful writing, worth the more common boy meets girl, helps her out, loses her, looks for her and gets a real good beating on the journey. Hamilton has a great future, and we're the beneficiaries. 4 stars. Larry Scantlebury	2005-04-03

What is important is that we are in the Olympic Stands viewing the most difficult part of a track and field event, the change of the baton. And Clive Cussler does it very, very well. 4 stars.

Unconventional comes to mind. That and believable dialogue.<br /><br />Frank Thorpe has climbed to the top of the food chain in government sanctioned black bag-wet operations. He's dropped down to the bottom of the food chain in self esteem and a sense of purpose. The French call it \\"raison d'etre.\\" On the one hand he knows it and reaches out to the lovely next door neighbor professor cum psychologist Claire. But like an addict, he can't stop doing what he's been trained to do.<br /><br />His last mission is what gets him kicked out of \\"the company,\\" blamed for the murders of a safe house crew when wounded, he brings the wolf to the chicken house in the mistaken belief that the wolf is but a CPA. Of course I say this not to denigrate CPAs.<br /><br />Frank's wounded and mustered out. It's now three months later. Billy, Frank's supervisor from \\"the Company\\" now in the private sector, wants Frank to join him in 'the same things they did before but without the rules.' As if rules ever stopped Frank. However Frank has resisted. He's mildly interested in Claire, a next door neighbor who thinks (not really) Frank's an insurance salesman, but 23 hours a day he misses his on again off again lover who was killed in the safe house debacle. So he's going to Miami for 3-4 weeks to hang out, eat spicy food, listen to great music. And he's at the airport. LAX. Lost, confused, no energy and bam!!!! an arrogant self righteous businessman complete with an alligator briefcase and hi-tech cell phone knocks down a Latino street kid selling candy. Bloodies his nose. Steps over him like he was rubbish. Never looks back. You know the type. And the switch dormant in Franks mind gets turned on.<br /><br />Douglas Meachum is about to get a wake up.<br /><br />Great job. Retribution. Remorse. Redemption. Great last two chapters. Recovery. Justice but not Holywood justice.<br /><br />Thanks Bob. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury5 stars. Larry Scantlebury	2005-04-02

I continue to be amazed at readers who take a fine book with extraodinary descriptions and hair raising dialogue, and pan it for the venue. It's like those that take a shot at Antony Bevor's \\"Stalingrad\\" by saying, 'sure it's good but there aren't any Americans in it.'<br /><br />Well. Anyhow, I thought Perez-Reverte's \\"Nautical Chart\\" to be brilliant. Tanger Soto is Matty Walker in 'Body Heat' or Phyllis Ditriechson if you prefer the older 'Double Indemnity.' Tanger's sensual good looks distract the observor from her creed: knowledge is power. Perez-Reverte even mention's that she has a slightly crooked nose, and you wonder for several hundred pages not just what it looks like but how she got it. That she is a genius does not overlook the fact that she is not complete and one of her needs is Coy.<br /><br />Coy is wounded in the very first paragraph of the book so what we are told is told in retrospect. Very well done. The thought that whatever happens, Coy is going to get hurt drifts in and out of our minds without being an impediment to the rest of the literary meal.<br /><br />Coy is a thorough, seafaring man, a little lost on the land but comfortable with life at sea, certainly never forgetting that men smarter than he were lost because they didn't recall the relentlessness of the ocean.<br /><br />They are to search for the sunken wreckage of the Dei Gloria, a Jesuit ship sunk in the late 16th century.<br /><br />The reasons why it might have been carrying treasure, the explanation that the system of longitude was moderately different in the 16th century, the placement of the possible sinking, the intrigue of the Spanish Court at the time of the sea chase, the other desperate scavengers, the alcohol, the prostitutes, the fights . . . .wow, slow moving? I certainly didn't think so.<br /><br />Perez-Reverte is brilliant. An icon in his native Spain he writes for all of Europe. A fair criticism is that an author writing in a foreign tongue is very reliant on the translator. The translator for \\"Queen of the South\\" was Willliam Hurley, who was excellent and seamless. But unless we speak both languages, we don't really know, do we? I'm satisfied with the translation of \\"The Nautical Chart\\" but I don't really know if anything was lost.<br /><br />5 Stars.

Brazile is incredible. I am a fan of her. She is a movie star (sorry for the analogy, Donna) just for whom you would see the movie. Up from poverty, Harvard, the really high rollers! Wise, insightful person. I caught her at the Dade County Book Fair last November and was mesmerized. So there you are you Republican Goose Stepping, sexists! But . . . .<br /><br />Too much rhetoric about the evil empire. If you can only win by telling the world that there's a conspiracy from the industrial, military, oil companies and facists in the TV studios hiding behind the bulk of the Rathers and the Brokaws, there's something wrong. We're adding 2+2 and coming up with 7. Come on. There's a problem. Let's solve it. Let's talk. You have all those states in the middle and they're all the same color. It may irritate you. May make you livid. But let's not use that tired rhetoric from the sixties. Please.<br /><br />I remember a video of Al Gore in the 2000 campaign accepting a bag of money from a Buddist Monk somewhere in California. Later he said he didn't know what it was (probably not a baloney sandwich bag lunch Al) and still later he was confused as to why he was there in the first pace. But the thing I remember was the look on his face. You want to see the same look? Dig up in the archives the picture of Gary Hart in 1988, 20 points ahead of his closest candidate competitor, sitting on the yacht in the Atlantic with the breathtaking Donna Rice on his lap. It's the look of  . . . is that a camera?<br /><br />So I am a huge fan of Ms. Brazile and I root for her and if she ever makes it to Ann Arbor, I'm there. I just find it tedious for our National electorate ON BOTH SIDES to throw Molotov Cocktails at eachother, and then deny it.<br /><br />Brazille is brilliant although she's still spinning. 4 stars.

James Patterson is a great beach writer. Ken Follett. A fun read. But like a marathon runner forced to walk up one flight of stairs, you're not going to get too much of a workout.<br /><br />Colonel Clay escapes incarceration at the hands of the evil Yankees, dodges a lot of slow moving musket balls, performs operations in the field, and with General Lee's blessing, slips through the Yankee lines at Appomatix to head for his father's homeland and meet his destiny, ah yes darlin', in Ireland. Erin Go Bragh. Ireland forever.<br /><br />Clay has a trust fund there and also an estate. But Ireland suffers the same fates as his beloved south and Clay is caught in the middle. Eventually he sides with the tenant farmers and chooses to fight against the intolerance and ignorance of their English masters. Which is an interesting flip-flop from his war years 1861-1865, if you choose to think about it. Mr. Higgins chose not to.<br /><br />All in good fun. A lot of longing looks and flutteriing eyelashes from the equestrian knockout Joanna Hamilton. Don't take it seriously. Enjoy it for what it is. Three stars, Larry Scantlebury	2005-04-01

The African American buddy - Hawk; the gay buddy - Milo; the reclusive, traumatized buddy - Joe Pike; the gorgeous woman buddy - Angie. This is my first introduction to the Native American buddy, Vinnie LeBlanc or in PC terms, the Ojibwa buddy.<br /><br />That Alex McKnight still is haunted by his memories of the Detroit Polce Department is natural. Most of us who served in Vietnam by example, still have distancing moments 30 years later. And Hamilton's description of the woods in the UP and north into Canada are worth the effort. He creates as few others do (James Dickey comes to mind) virtually another character in the person of the forest. Powerful. Very powerful.<br /><br />Additionally, I for one enjoyed 'not knowing' the why of the book, the crime that brings all the protagonists and antagonists together. We learn the 'what' early enough. The 'why' is not revealed until 7/8ths of the book is done. Nice twist.<br /><br />Some reviewers have pointed out that this is not the strongest Alex McKnight novel, and I look forward to the earlier ones. \\"Blood is the Sky\\" is a 2003 novel and I realize now that there is some history to the reluctant investigator that I want to follow up on.<br /><br />What I found disconcerting is there are too many unexplained references to a past I am unfamiliar with. While many authors find a character that grows as they do, Angie and Patrick, Elvis and Joe and the others, the successful ones seem to have subsequent novels that stand alone although they are part of a set. I didn't get that feeling with this one. I felt on occasion that Hamilton was giving us unrelated facts but not explaining their significance. Just an observation.<br /><br />Additionally, I had an English Professor in College that used to say that Shakespeare would bring all of his characters on stage in Act Five, and then kill them all. (Caeser; MacBeth; Hamlet; Lear.) Shakespeare could pull it off. In the hands of the less gifted (which is all of us), it can become grisly and perhaps senseless. I think the 'movie' criticism used is gratuitous. There is an element of that here.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I will read more of Steve Hamilton and Alex McKnight. It's a good read. 4 stars.

I don't mean \\"like\\" in the sense that it held the permissive excitement of the roaring twenties or the emotional promiscuity of the sixties, but 'like'as in fascinated. Like as in haunted. Like as in troubled.<br /><br />Additionally, it is the true Armageddon of our memory, of our time. Hitler and Stalin ARE the evil empire and should they be victorious, the world would be oh so different than it is now.<br /><br />Finally, I think if you read about that time, whether it's the novels of Deaver or Diehl or Woods on the one hand or the extraordinary Beevor's \\"Stalingrad\\" and \\"The Fall of Berlin,\\" or Ambrose' \\"Easy Company\\" or Ryan's \\"D-Day,\\" one gets the sense that for the Europeans, it wan't all black and white and no, John Wayne and Robert Mitchum didn't epitomize it. Nor Metro Goldwyn Mayer.<br /><br />So Alan Furst brings to the table a series of novels not in black and white but in gray. Where the characters are motivated by doing the right thing but, where is that damn right thing? And how much of this morality do I have to extrapolate? And are there situational ethics that no one's written about? And do my handlers really care if I win or not, or just that I put on \\"a bloody good show, mate.\\" And what is winning, anyhow? Is it living? On some days, is it just surviving?<br /><br />Here Eric DeHaan, Ship's Captain, is seduced by Dutch Naval Intelligence. Well, \\"seduced\\" implies some volition on his part and clearly, if at all, there is little. His ship, the M/V Noordendam, will be used not so much for tramp steaming but to change it's name to the Santa Rosa, a South American steamer bearing an uncanny resemblance to the Noordendam, and carry men and material to be used against the Nazi effort. Which by now is most of Europe. Captain DeHaan needn't worry about this duplicity because the Santa Rosa, the real one, is stuck in port in South America with repair work taking at a minimum of several months. So right off the bat, you have to know both women are going to go to the same Oscar party wearing the same gown. At some point.<br /><br />DeHaan sails off to join a British convoy which as you recall from your history is the chickens strolling before the foxes,  ripe, target rich plucking for the German Wolfpack. DeHaan's crew is very well described not as misfits but, let's use the current phrase, diverse.<br /><br />There's actually three stories here, the British convoy trip followed by two others. I didn't mind this. Although loosely related they all carried the common thread of DeHaan sucked along this vortex of espionage that he is uncertain if his handlers understand.<br /><br />DeHaan is as \\"everyman\\" as Captain John Miller in \\"Ryan\\" or Lieutenant Winters in \\"Easy Company.\\" Every once in awhile he wants to ask 'how did I get here?'<br /><br />Bars on the waterfronts of Alexandria and Lisbon, love affairs with compromised women and friendships with on again off again friends. Like the old gameshow, Who do you Trust?<br /><br />Excellent work by Mr. Furst. Well worth the read. 5 Stars.

Here Hawk, the Spenser running mate for . . . . is it thirty years(?), takes three in the back while acting as a bodyguard. The result is extreme physical and psychic trauma. 'Nothing like being shot at and missed' said Churchill, but here of course the shooter didn't miss.<br /><br />While the quips, the jokes about manhood, the comments about race, the seething sexuality as well as resolve that is Hawk never ends, we do get a glimpse of why Hawk is Hawk, what he paid to become Hawk, and how anything else is less.<br /><br />The flirtation with mortality that Spenser underwent in Small Vices is also present but Parker presents it a little differently and in a manner that Hawk would not object to. And Susan, who showed a lot of hutzpah in Melancholy Baby, also plays a more substantial role here as well. Just don't expect her to start packing.<br /><br />I do find that dog tedious. But it's well worth the battle that Spenser is faced with, unqualified loyalty to the only person he loves after Susan and his own code which will be if not violated then tainted if Hawk has his way to take out the Ukranian Mob from bottom to top.<br /><br />We love Spenser because he can bloody the nose and crack the ribs of the foulest of humans, all the while quoting Sydney Carton's lines from The Tale of Two Cities. At first (Godwulf, Ceremony, A Savage Place, Rachel) it seemed like a gimmick but then I along with a million other Parker fans knew that this was what Spenser really was, a self educated patriot for the soul who would do the right thing or the next right thing, asking no quarter and giving none. He is one of George Orwell's 'hard men.' Spenser has a code. So does Hawk. They're just a little different. That's the story of Cold Service. Good stuff. Neither Spenser nor Parker ever disappoints. 5 stars. Thanks Mr. Parker, for keeping it going and never maling it in. Larry Scantlebury	2005-03-08

A lot of misleading trailers and sound bites. There are a lot of reasons for this but mostly I believe it's because we go into Borders with a book on our mind and when we're done, we have two hardcovers and two paperbacks and a cup of latte-latte-decaf-expresso and we're a $100 dollars lighter.<br /><br />This is good for the libraries.

Shame on me that I lost my literary discrimination and failed to realize that the emphasis in the above sentence should have been on \\"first\\" and certainly not on either of the \\"great\\"s that followed and that Eco and Brown had nothing to be concerned about.<br /><br />The 'whodunnit' or 'riddle' book has always been appealing.

And juxtaposed against that was, in the evil empire, Pravda, all the news Darth Vader saw fit to print. Colliding ideologies, of course, but Dr. Crichton raises the haunting question that possibly they were in sync; Maybe they were from a parallel universe.<br /><br />Not in collaboration of course, but rather they might have been different instruments involved in the same allegro. The PLM theory. Politicians require catastrophes to get elected; Litigators require crises to get monumental verdicts; Media requires collossal dangers lurking around every corner to get ratings. PLM. It really only works, Crichton more than surmises, only if they can keep US in a \\"State of Fear.\\"<br /><br />There seems to be a fundamental truth to that, even if we only suspected it. Andrea Yates gets more press than Mother Teresa. Scott Petersen gets more air time than Pope John. The concept of 'random acts of kindness' gets . . . nothing. And sometimes something totally unexpected happens and the suits are left scurrying. Come on. Weren't you a little surprised at that map on CBS, ABC, NBC and CNN on November 16th? You know, the one that had the blue states and the red states?<br /><br />Crichton's theory is not so much that all is good with the environment, it's just that the public at large is manipulated to believe sound bites and banners. Scientific research and scientists who get published are being paid by someone. Like experts brought into a heady trial, they're going to say what they are paid to say. Climate changes, says Crichton. Always has, always will. While hybrid cars are not a bad idea, maybe we shouldn't pave over the highways and torch GM, yet.<br /><br />Bad things happen. Evil exists. Terrorism strikes. Police are sometimes victems and sometimes they overreact. But we owe it to ourselves to force the PLMs to avoid the easy answer.<br /><br />He presents a plea for balance.

He doesn't support gas guzzling SUV's and Hummers as much as he asks us to be wary of where the statistics came from that lead us to believe they are the harbingers of the end of Western Civilization.<br /><br />This book is an excellent story about us, the nation of sheep as we were once called. The characters are possibly steroetyped. Peter Evans, one of the mainstays of the tale, is frankly, goofy. How did this guy pass the bar? Talk about living in a cave. For an upcoming seasoned litigator he has limited communication skills, has the vision of a NASCAR fan after a six-pack (sorry, cheap shot, I like NASCAR), bills no hours that I could tell, and has the pablum-like MTV-speak of . . . .

Yet they tell a riveting story that keeps you turning the pages. Crichton hangs it all together and to a certain extent, shows a willingness to go the distance while taking on the established view, which is we're all going to die gasping for breath in the greatest country of the world with neither living fish or fowl.

Parker also does a great job juxtaposing the story of Burke and Robinson with his own initiation to baseball. Parker gives himself some props when as a young 15 year old in the forties, he senses the error and perhaps evil associated with racism. Yet that is kind of what happened to my brothers and me, and I know we are better men for it.<br /><br />Burke is a brooding, horribly wounded young man although his emotional scars seem to be worse than the physical ones, which all in all seem to be mending alright.<br /><br />There's a loose relationship with a hired gun, Cash, which is like the Spenser of old selecting companions based on loyalty and honor, not whose side they're on, but Burke is no Spenser.

If you're reading her, quite possibly you have previously been immersed in Susan Silverman's boyfriend's story, old whats-his-name. I used to think that Sunny was just a cop turned detective and was about to emulate all of those virile manly charms on a female frame. I guess that means I ought to call 1-800-IMASEXISTINDENIAL or arrange for an appointment with Dr. Silverman.<br /><br />In any event, Sunny's her own man . . . .errrr, person. In the early chapters we come face to face with her former husband, Ritchie, re-marrying and the crushing weight that falls on her heart. And like her self directed questioning, we want to know why should this be a problem? He was there for five years; he'll still be there. You weren't going to marry him then; you're not going to marry him now. Sure it hurts. Next.<br /><br />Then we get to meet Sarah Markham, the criminal issue at the center of \\"Melancholy Baby,\\" nearly as emotionally repulsive a character as Paul G. was in the early Parkers. Very subtle move Professor Parker. Deft. Cunning. Will Sarah show up again? Will she stop chain smoking for God's sake?<br /><br />And in the search for psychic retribution for Sarah, we gain some insight into Sunny. We sense the courage it takes her to listen to the loving advice from Spike, a Hawk-like character from the other side of the Church, that she must seek psychological help, and she then returns to Dr. Copeland.<br /><br />Dr. Copeland listens to her rant and rave and snivel, and then tells her  . . . . he's retiring. He refers her to a Phd. in Cambridge (did you guys see this coming?) who is Dr. Silverman.<br /><br />Again, kudos to Parker, because it gives Susan a depth we rarely see when she's just what's his name's girlfriend. Then she's on the same playing field as Belson, Hawk, Marcus, Hawk's plethora of women friends. Now she's a central figure and we learn from Sunny's admiration of her.<br /><br />Anyhow, a very well written book. I suppose eventually the meeting between the two major Parker characters must take place. I hope not. Sunny is a certain style of person, he's different. When I've seen it done in the past, (Michael Connely) it hasn't necessarily been seamless.<br /><br />The only thing I might have held back was Sunny's age. You never know how a character will take off. At some point it might be hard to imagine her fighting crime with a winsome smile and great legs at the age of 57. Nevertheless, a hard 5 stars.

So any story Griffith tells, even this one early in his career, strikes a target rich environment. All the Griffith characters are emboldened with focus and fidelity, and here is no exception.<br /><br />Griffith's writing skills evolved along with his story telling, plot construction and the ability to hold a few face cards close to his chest so as not to reveal them until page three hundred or thereabout.<br /><br />My own journey through the prodigous Mr. Griffith was to pick up the first of the Corps series, meet China Marine Ken McCoy, and fasten my seat belt. Then I went to the Army series and started with The Lieutenants. Anyhow that was my approach.<br /><br />I think if you haven't read him, you ought to start with one of those to see how the plot evolves. Soldier Spies is like seeing a great athlete in stuttering, poorly focused VHS films in the Fifth Grade.

He's a wounded Irish cop with an attitude. He's 40 years old, with an attitude. He's a loving, humorous husband, with an attitude. And here, his Godfather Nelson DeMille gives him an already laid table upon which to have an attitude.<br /><br />He actually is moved and bored by the 2001 memorial service to the deaths of 230 people aboard TWA Flight 800 into the ocean just south of Cupsogue Beach on Long Island. He's not moved by patriotism (well a little; we know that from the Corey mystique) and if there's a dry eye in the crowd it ain't Corey's. He's there to accompany his wife, FBI Agent Kate Mayfield, who worked the case five years earlier. He really doesn't care. What are the Yanks doing? Will Mrs. Corey favor him with marital bliss before they go home? These are the important issues in his life. Maybe some Scotch as well.<br /><br />That is until Liam Griffith, mean spirited FBI agent, gets in John's face after the service and says to get the heck out of Dodge, that it's none of his business and if he and his wife continue to 'poke around,' there in deep trouble. And John, from the neck down, face flushed, muscles tightening, says, \\"You talkin' to me.\\"<br /><br />I like John Corey. He's a great character. He's relentless, irreverant, courageous, focused and faithful. He's a lot like Spenser and Elvis Cole and Joe Pike, but John has a level of dysfunction that's refreshing, because it reminds us of . . . . us.<br /><br />He's still angry at his wife for dalliances she \\"might\\" have had BEFORE she met him. As my younger friends say, \\"I'm down with that.\\"<br /><br />So I think Kate is masterful at bringing John to the service. She just lets it flow, because she figures out what will happen. She's Ms. Procedure, \\"the company (FBI) line\\" but she knows that her old man is truly a loose cannon. And she has her own misgivings about the investigation of TWA 800's demise.<br /><br />So that's about it. I didn't tell you much of the facts but you already know them. I think the sex between the couple on the beach, Bud Mitchell and Jill Winslow, is just a little too graphic but frankly, I thought the development of the two of them, having started to be one dimensional, to eventually be quite deep.<br /><br />This is too long but let me add one other point for the DeMille-o-philes (like myself).

Nick Rey's father is kidnapped by a splinter group of the original Marxist terrorists that frequent-inhabit Nicaragua and particularly, the phone booth cramped Bogata. Matthew Rey is in Nicaragua to buy 4 fishing boats to augment his successful seafood-fishing business.<br /><br />Nick Rey's father, Matthew is a straight arrow (we're pretty sure) but as in most families, Matthew has those family secrets that haunt many of us.<br /><br />So we have at least two plots going on, plus the disappearance of Lindsey, the sister of Nick, and the denial of claim by the insurance company holding K&R insurance on Matthew (kidnap and ransom). So add two more. Then there's the introduction of the negotiator, Alex Cabreras, with five knife wound scars in her back and you have a really riveting book with really interesting characters. The FBI is pressuring Nick to \\"give up his Dad\\" and Matthew's partner doesn't seem so squeaky clean.<br /><br />The reason I made it a 4 instead of a 5 is I find the dialogue uncomfortable. The guy, Nick Rey, is an articulate trial lawyer paid big bucks to convince, understand, react, all the while on his feet. Yet in talking to his girfriend - ex-girlfriend, girlfriend, he's an idiot. It's like we're looking at Wally Cleaver in the Third Grade having his first crush on Miss Johnson. Dialogue will make you sink or swim.

Could be a "Godfather" if it was written in the U.S.	Teresa Mendoza reminds me a little of Matty Walker in Body Heat, the searing, thrilling, sensual movie of 1980's fame. We're not really sure of how Matty got to where she is when we first see her, and like that, we really aren't certain of where we start with Teresa.<br /><br />Certainly, Perez-Reverte seems to paint a picture of innocence when 'the phone rings.' Sexy innocence. I can't recall any novel of such intense excitement beginning with the heroine shaving her legs. But maybe Perez-Reverte is having a joke on us. Perhaps he's saying, 'not innocence my friend, but naivete. Untested. Unaware.' Once she gets to her safe house a few pages later she takes a hit of coke. All is not as we first perceived. Come to think of it, most if not all of Perez-Reverte's characters are never as first observed.<br /><br />He is a remarkable author, a combination of all of our \\"name\\" brands writing in Spain, certainly popular all over Europe and now with a substantial following in the US. And this is a remarkable book with heavy doses of greed, sexism, crime, desire, retribution and redemption.<br /><br />When her lover, Guero Davilla, a pilot smuggling drugs is killed, she knows she will be next. Such is the way it will be in Sinola, Mexico, he warns her repeatedly, as he left a cell phone for her with only one purpose, to tell her that he has been killed. Or tortured and killed. Then the Mexican narcotic traffickers, the narcos, will kill the entire family of the traitor. Guero says he will hold out as long as he can but eventually he will tell them where to find her. He says \\"the phone will ring and if you don't run, soon you will see someone you know. He will smile at you. And then you are a dead woman.\\"<br /><br />The only thing that Guero left besides $20,000 and a Colt Double Eagle pistol was a diary of events and places, and of course, names. He tells her under no circumstances should she read the diary but to turn it over to his old narco boss, don Epfanio Vargas. She does this, and the don spares her life and gives her a 24 hour start.<br /><br />The other thing about Perez-Reverte is that his diction and description and dialogue are all just beautiful. He reminds me of Alan Furst who writes about pre World War Europe, detailing violent events in a rich, deep style.<br /><br />The journey takes Mendoza one step away from death to one of the most powerful drug lords in the world.

If that's how you feel, why are you reading novels?<br /><br />This is an excellent novel of life 2400 years ago, when Phillip of Macedon united the City States of Greece and led them from civil war into a powerful, united world force, only upon his assassination to give it all to his teenage son. Like the teenage Henry 1500 years later preaching to the English troops at Agincourt ('are we not a Band of Brothers?'), Alexander rules by example and veteran generals three times his age follow his dream to rule the known world. And he does.<br /><br />The novel is told in the first person, somewhat like a movie, Alexander speaking to his brother-in-law Itanes in his command tent as he is about to do battle in India. In that respect the book is a series of flashbacks however they are done comfortably and for the most part, seamlessly.<br /><br />Those readers who reflect on the story of Alexander being a tome on leadership are 100% correct. Certainly he captures the hearts and souls of his army as he leads it around the world and molds it to his vision.<br /><br />I think I discovered Alexander in the fourth grade through the prodding of an unorthodox, avante garde nun who pushed the Alexander myth. The three events I recall from that time are the weeping at the end of the journey, the slicing of the Gordian knot once Persdia is taken (not much play here) and Alexander's love for his giant battle horse, Bucephalus, who gets a lot of description here.<br /><br />Excellent stuff.

I heard at one point that the greatest opening line in a novel was \\"It was a dark and stormy night.\\" I don't know if this is true. It sounds a little too subjective. But Stephen Horn does grab you on the first page.<br /><br />I like Horn's protaganists, Frank O'Connell here and Phillip Barkley in \\"Gravity\\" because they are flawed. We like Spenser and Elvis Cole but after awhile, they are almost too good in both the physical and the metaphysical sense. But O'Connell is a mutt. Even we, the reader, who are supposed to feel sympathy for him, cluck our tongues when we find he walked away from the beautiful girl, the loving (Ay, Laddie, treated him like me own son from Kerry) father-in-law, the worshipping son, the million dollar income for . . . . we don't know why?

You expect good; you get it. Once in awhile though you pick up a book with an author you haven't read.

Sure, life got on its hind legs and gave him a beating. Yes. Sad. Teary. But it's time to get over it. You know. Move on. But Barkley is a mess. Anti-depressants, sleeplessness, and talk about your flight risks? Barkley's packed and ready to go to (???) Oregon.<br /><br />Agent Turner of the FBI on the other hand is a self absorbed witch, out for herself, motivated not just for success but for victory.<br /><br />Martin Green is a Jewish assistant in the Senate searching for illicit campaign funding. And suddenly he discovers . . . something. We don't know what. But he is hastily accused of treason, and then kills himself. Barkley for the AG's office and Turner for the FBI are assigned to investigate. Turner sees Barkley as an impediment and wants to dump him. Barkley couldn't care less. Except . . . .<br /><br />In his prozac stupor, Barkley thinks it's odd that Green killed himself because he remembers that while at college, Green spoke out harshly over the suicide of a friend saying that it was the coward's way out and solved nothing. So Green's suicide makes little sense to Barkley.<br /><br />That's all he has to go on.<br /><br />I can't tell you how magnetic the book was. And I am pleased by the reviewers who say that the prior book, \\"In Her Defense,\\" is even better. I picked that up last night. Merry Christmas to me. 5 Stars. Excellent stuff.

Notice I didn't say they have the best team in baseball. This year it's the Red Sox. But the Yankee players are usually the best that money can buy.<br /><br />Funny how we laud successful people like Jack Welch, Herb Kelleher and Martha (before the orange coveralls) Stewart. But then we rip Steinbrenner. Probably because he's such a rude, mannerless billionaire. My suspicians are that often the two characteristics create a symbiotic relationship.<br /><br />I'm a Red Sox fan from that part of the world. My parents are buried at St. John's in Winthrop. My brothers played sports there. My sister works there. The day before I left for Vietnam my Dad took me to Fenway to see the Sox and the Yankees.<br /><br />But I'm sure the Red Sox brain trust, Lucciani and Epstein et. al., are as difficult as Steinbrenner. Face it. If Mother Teresa is in the lobby of the Empire State Building and she wants to go to the top and see the view and say a few prayers for the poor and Red Sox management is in one elevator and Yankee management's in the other, she's taking the stairs.<br /><br />But Buster Olney takes the last game of the Diamondback Series in 2001 and shows it to be 'the end of the line' for the Yankees. Certainly he seems prescient. Buster takes the game inning by inning and reports on everything from the pitch count to what striking out players were swinging at. And then in between the innings, he tells the story of the fall from grace, the cost of greatness, why some players flourish under the searchlight scrutiny of New York and why some sing The Stones' dirge, \\"Gimmee Shelter.\\"<br /><br />5 Stars.

Learned historians have argued for years about the cause, loss, destruction and Armageddon-like aspects of the Second World War. Insanity, greed, myopia, good versus evil. One of the more compelling arguments that the storm that gathered which would turn Europe into a giant necropolis was that it was intrinsically evil. More so than in other conflicts dating back to Alexander. And at the heart of that is the death camps.<br /><br />Hard to explain. It is so horrific as to make the brightest of women and men shudder in attempts to comprehend. Just to understand takes monumental discipline.<br /><br />Simon Weisenthal, the most known of the Nazi hunters, was once asked if ever we come to the point that we have hunted these monsters of the Reichstag long enough. Weisenthal responded, \\"never.\\" We must remember. We must have something to remind us. We must never forget.<br /><br />I'm not sure that the novel is the best forum for that monument. But at times it may be the only forum. Mr. Silva presents a magnetic, riveting novel on the search for a death camp officer who, through a series of believable ironies and misguided assitance escaped detection.<br /><br />It is a terrifying journey.

The guy's just unbelievable!<br /><br />I would discuss the plot now but really, is it any different than the preceding 9 plots? Huh? No.<br /><br />Mr. Woods writes a compelling novel. The only other author who writes like this, predictably, repetitiously, same characters, is Parker, who churns out Spensers at the rate of one a year. I happen to prefer Spenser because I believe he is imbued with a code of sorts that he can't define but other men admire and seek to emulate. Spenser's an honorable man. Stone is really a good looking, wealthy guy that has the morals of a cat. An indescriminate cat if you will. Which is why Parker usually get a 5 and Woods usually gets a 4. I like Spenser more.<br /><br />But I'll always read Woods. Like everything else, it's a matter of your mood. 4 stars. Larry Scantlebury	2004-12-02

Mr. Deaver says he does not like to ambush his readers especially those electing to buy his hard cover books. So he lets people know right off the bat that he's writing about Berlin in 1936. That may have turned some readers off. Pity. They missed an extraordinary book.<br /><br />Well let's see. Germany in 1936. You would have to be on Bill and Ted's Excellent Vacation or with Sean Penn at Ridgemont High to not realize that Armageddon was about to begin. So Mr. Deaver surmises, what about a plot not to assassinate Hitler (Tried that. Didn't work. Unfortunately.) but to assassinate his rearmament expert and throw the rebuilding of the Third Reich into chaos.<br /><br />This is a cross between William Diehl's brilliant \\"Eureka\\" and an Allan Furst novel. It's a great period piece and Deaver generously sprinkles innocent reminders for us throughout the book. Cars. Travel by ship. Newspapers. Clothing. Hats. Brands of cigarettes. Drinks. Hostesses.<br /><br />And of course the center of all this is Paul Schumann, a tough Humphrey Bogart like hit man who truly - corny as it sounds - is about to discover that there is something Homeric about him.<br /><br />Every great detective story needs a great cop and here it's Willi Kohl, hot on the heels of Paul Schumann, who also is about to discover the hero within. Great stuff. I hope Paul Schumann returns. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury	2004-11-28

I am more confused by several co-reviewers adulation than I am by the plot . . . errrr . . . attempted plot. No one seems to have noticed but this was done before. Back in the early days of \\"real\\" TV-Movies, Glenn Ford was trotted out of retirement and starred with William Conrad in \\"The Brotherhood of the Bell,\\" a secret organization to go that one step further when justice faltered. It bombed.<br /><br />Apparently unwilling to heed George Santana's caveat about what happens when you don't pay attention to history, \\"The Star Chamber\\" was made ten years later with the ever chin thrusting Michael Douglas and Hal Holbrook. It was the same story, tedious, boring, UNBELIEVABLE, with an ending so incredible as to defy logic.<br /><br />So now we have \\"Kill Clause,\\" which should start off by playing the memorable 'As Time Goes by' from Casablanca, \\"it's still the same old story.\\"<br /><br />It's begins with a particularly offensive murder of a child. Why authors seem willing to play this horrific card, the violation of and killing of children, I don't know. Don't they know that readers don't forgive them for this effort . . . .  and for the 4 or 5 thereafter?<br /><br />So Marshal Tim Rackley learns of his daughters death, has some (almost equally) painful dialogue with his wife, and joins forces with a group of psychopaths who analyze capital cases that freed the accused, and then 'vote' on whether they should assassinate the defendant. I thought Goebbels, Eichmann and Mengele were dead?<br /><br />Don't waste your time. I gave it 2 stars for several intricacies of plot and timing, but frankly, it could of been 1.

Bits of him are found in Nelson DeMille, Len Deighton, LeCarre to some extent, and Furst to some extent. And the Nazis and Russians are an enormous mother lode of people who transcend evil. So it's hard to run out of bad guys.<br /><br />Another thing that punctuates the Ludlum novel in addition to great characters is that there is that stream of history that runs through it. Accuracy. Some truth. How much? We just don't know. Jason Bourne? We don't dismiss him because we can see where such events might have commenced. The Parsifal Mosaic? Might have been. Who knows.<br /><br />And here we have Stalingrad. Giving the devil his due, literally and figuratively, how could Hitler have been coerced into invading Russia? Yammamoto was supposed to have called the U.S. 'the sleeping giant' after the rejection of a second attack on Pearl, but any student of history knows that the real sleeping giant was the rabid Bear of Mother Russia.<br /><br />So a diabolical, intricate plan is hatched to use double and triple agents to create that whiff of believability, and somehow translate that pseudo conspiracy to the highest level of the Third Reich, to Hitler himself. To not just shatter the truce between Germany and Russia, but to get Hitler to invade the Soviet Union.<br /><br />And at the center of this, a man we start off disliking, the promiscuous, educated, multi-lingual Steven Metcalf.<br /><br />Good plot, complicated figures, double crosses and triple crosses. Murder most foul. But we must remember that it is a rewrite. Mr. Ludlum is dead. This is but a manuscript, a work in progress.<br /><br />My criticism of the novel is that too much time is spent explaining to the reader why Metcalf is NOT going to do something, virtually over and over. The dialogue is crisp but the introspective thought patterns tedious. They are too long. It drags in parts.<br /><br />Excellent stuff but maybe it's time to let Mr. Ludlum rest in peace. 4 stars.

He paints the 'good' lawyers as shallow, amoral, money chasing, well dressed bottom dwellers and the bad lawyers . . . . well, far worse.<br /><br />Here a younger Alex Delaware is asked to address the parents of a 5 year old cancer sufferer whom they are trying to remove from medical care stating that they can treat the child better on their own. Of course the idiocy of the parents lets us know within a chapter that there is a horrid evil lurking close to the surface and indeed there is. Dr. delaware must address murder, sex, evil lawyers and misleading police professionals. But his love for Robyn, who gratefully does not make an appearance here (sorry folks; tired of the super hero having the normal relationship in the face of unspeakable evil) remains unabated, and his closest friend Detective Milo Sturgis, remain anchors for what he must face.<br /><br />A few sketchy scenes but enough to know that Kellerman and Delaware were going to be moving forces for the next two decades. There is a scene in the last third where Dr. D sneaks into an abandoned house that will leave you on the edge of your seat. And there are a number of twists I never saw coming.

Mr. Cannell does two things different than in the earlier Shane Scully genre. One works and one . . . I'm not sure of.<br /><br />First of all, having read some of the other \\"Hollywood\\" writers, Cannell is clearly the best at putting out the visual, articulate, Hollywood pulp detective novel. And Scully is a great Hollywood dick, tough on crime, loyal to his friends, anti-management and with a strong moral compass.<br /><br />Here he addresses the assassination of his friend Sheriff Emo Rojas. It gives Cannell an opportunity to explore and enhance Shane's diverse circle of friends, especially his partnering and emotional liason with the lesbian sheriff assigned to work with him. This reminded me of Spenser's work with Rachel Wallace in \\"Searching for Rachel Wallace,\\" an excellent novel in its own right well before its time. But Cannell does a very nice job here and it leads Scully to have some serious conversations with himself on the slippery topics of where is he going, with his wife, with his son, with the job, with himself. This, by the way, is extremely well presented.<br /><br />The part I didn't necessarily support is his wife, heretofore presented as an equal, who comes off, well, whining and witchy.<br /><br />Alexa has always been the ying to Scully's yang, and here she clearly can't handle the load. Up to this point Mr. Cannell has treated her with well deserved deference; here she comes off like an anonymous 'chick.'<br /><br />All in all, excellent Shane Scully. Cannell is still the man. 5 Stars. Larry Scantlebury	2004-10-24

It is perhaps ironic that it came to the end that it did. It is difficult, maybe impossible, when one realizes the true extent of the killings, murders, tortures and combat related deaths from 1935 to 1945 surpassing anything in history, not to be overwhelmed with the deepest sadness.<br /><br />Beevor occasionally is criticized for his journalistic approach to history.

And I'm just talking about acne and skinny arms (or chests)! Imagine what we would feel like if we had terminally ill sibs?<br /><br />As a result we have pushed to the more distant recesses of our memory what we did or even more significantly, why we did it. So the 15-year old ingenue in White's excellent murder mystery is at times conniving, relentless, obsessed, beautiful, kid-like, confused along with all of the other formed and unformed virtue/vices of kids placed in life and death circumstances. Or what we imagine those to be.<br /><br />Her infant sister is dying of a rare disease necessitating, if it will work at all, an expensive heart transplant. Each member of the family has made tremendous sacrifices and then Merritt, the 15-year old, is charged with the murder of the CEO of the insurance provider who rejected the application for the transplant. Did she? Didn't she? Who did?

The book has several surprises including the ending, which I both liked and was also caught unsupecting.<br /><br />I do have to add that this time I was facing a long road trip and decided to get the 19 CD audio version read by Jason Culp. Culp does a wonderful job of reading, assigning characters different reading tones and modulations.

The Russians executed over 13,000 of their own men during Stalingrad, the lesser known turning point of the ill titled Armageddon of World War II. I say 'ill titled' because Armageddon is the biblical phrase used to describe the great final battle between good and evil. Clearly, one would have to conclude that at best Hitler and Stalin were (to get to the point) psychopaths and at worst, the 20th century's models for evil.<br /><br />The push to invade the Soviet Union poised close to 4 million German and pro-Axis troops at the onset of the invasion of Russia. That such an effort could first be conceived and then implemented is in itself staggering. And yet with such covert, detailed planning, the three direction movement against Leningrad, Moscow and Stalingrad really begins the end of the campaign for the Third Reich.<br /><br />Mr. Beevor's strongest criticism from reviewers and historical experts is that his style becomes somewhat journalistic. This is true however I remain unconvinced that in these efforts of horror on a world level, possibly that is the only way to record it. Body counts and mileage gained in three days of fighting may not be the best method to report such carnage. 'Blood, mud and ice' may be better.<br /><br />In any event, Mr. Beevor has created a mnasterpiece that should be included in any serious library.

This is an excellent textbook and really is chock full of sophisticated issues not always explored such as ethics, moral reasoning, the glass ceiling, and diversity.<br /><br />The quote above actually completed reads, \\"If a man or woman has character, nothing else matters; If a man or woman doesn't have character . . . nothing else matters.\\" Issues such as these are addressed.<br /><br />Models such as the A-O-R model, fundamental attribution error and self serving bias are examined.<br /><br />The only observation I have, certainly not a criticism, is that the book is directed more towards a group with a fair amount of life experiences under their belt.

The 3 stars-4 stars-5 stars rating system removes a lot of wiggle room. So reading a Stone Barrington novel is enjoyable albeit Stone is pretty whorish, wears $300 Thomas Pink shirts, signs checks with $500 pens and flies the Concorde (\\"Is there another way of crossing the Atlantic?\\") It's just that it's so formula-driven.<br /><br />The beginnings are the same. A girlfriend/fiance who was both a magnificent lover and kind to animals and . . . was going to settle Stone down (read monogamy) totally unexpectedly breaks up with him. This is at Elaine's, the fabulous New York bistro where the usual suspects gather to mock him with derisive jokes dripping with sarcasm.<br /><br />What's not to like? I don't want to make fun of Stone. I want to hang out with him. Every woman wants to sleep with him. Even the ones that used to sleep with him. He has great relations with ex-lovers and future lovers. He has all the money in the world. He has status. Cool friends. He's heroic. Funny. Did I mention every woman wants to sleep with him?<br /><br />Anyhow, it's all very predictable. He's James Bond without the title and with a New York attitude. He's like Jack Molloy in Mike Lupica's books, goofy but at a very, very high level.<br /><br />A pleasant read but don't expect any angst, riveting dialogue or moral Hobson's choices. Light. Airy. Not substantive. 3 stars. Larry Scantlebury	2004-09-21

It's brilliant. Funny. Perhaps even ad libbed. Murray gets kudos for it. We mimic it. Commercials 15 years later copy it. We remember that scene, and to paraphrase another great movie line, 'in all the excitement, I kinda' forgot' the name of the movie myself. That's how good the scene is. It transcends the rest of the movie.<br /><br />That's why I read Leonard, because of the quirky scenes. No. I don't unsderstand the conflict between the Contras and the Sandanistas. I'm still confused about Reagan and Ollie North. But I love the conversations that Jack has with his brother-in-law in the funeral home, and the conversations he has with Lucy. Will she? Does she want to? Is she an ecstatic?<br /><br />One of the editorialists above writes that Leonard is sui generis, the latin description of an anomaly loosely translated to mean 'one in a million.'<br /><br />That's kind of how I see him write. The plot need not be the most important thing. He doesn't shy away from violence nor does he embrace it. I think he's brilliant. He writes about the dumb things that people say to eachother and the even dumber things that they think about. And once in awhile about the truly remarkable, Homeric, beautiful things that they do.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because it does bog down a little with the ecstatic-nun-random acts of kindness-political issues-Irish freedom fighters-loopy ex-cons in the middle, but all in all, vintage Leonard.	2004-09-21

Jack Molloy's Dad, also known as simply \\"Molloy,\\" begged, beat and bullied those around him to live his dream and build both a stadium and a team to rival the glory days of New York Football. It's a little bit of \\"Wake up the Echoes\\" and Sinatra singing \\"New Yawk, New Yawk.\\" And then Molloy Sr. dies and Jack inheirits it all. The dynasty has begun . . . well, maybe not quite.<br /><br />Jack goes off to London with the love of his life, Annie Kay, and spends months and months drinking, smoking and Annie Kaying. In a Hemmingwayesque funk, he forgets what is important to him. Annie Kay returns to New York to pursue her own life, living in wealthy abandon not as much fun as it was a few months earlier. And Jack stays on feeling sorry for himself when he is approached to sell his  1/2 interest in the team to Dick Miles, a Darth Vader-like hostile takeover investor.<br /><br />There are some things that Mr. Lupica does that leave him head and shoulders above the rest. One is he writes great dialogue. Jack's conversations with his deceased Dad are priceless, rivalling Ken Bruen's Irish chraraters talking to the dead. And the conversations with his African American players, his deep, deep southern coach, and wealthy Yale colleagues are equally hilarious without appearing stilted.<br /><br />And he tells a good tale. If there is a drawback it is that I felt unmotivated by the character of Jack Molloy, now and the first time around. Jack's like Stone Barrington of Stuart Woods fame; it's hard to identify with life's more mundane problems eg. girlfriend issues, if the speaker is a multi-millionaire. At least Barrington get's shot at; Jack spends a lot of time feeling sorry for himself.<br /><br />Nevertheless, a good read that is both entertaining and funny. 4 Stars. Larry Scantlebury	2004-09-19

Jack Molloy, who has the most endearing conversations with his deceased father since John Connolley and Ken Bruen (must be the Irish in Lupica), (re)falls in love with Annie Kay, moves to Europe, and spends a year in a Hemingwayesque funk. Cigarettes. Expensive booze. Drifting at a very high level. But . . .  <br /> <br />Annie's got to move on with her life. What's a girl to do? So like the old Don McClean song, she 'takes the last train to the coast' where she becomes a network Sports Anchor and Jack remains, hungover. He realizes now, belatedly, how much he loves her but, he can't quite tell her how important she is to him. His team gets an \\"offer they can't refuse\\" from the evil and egomanical Dick Miles, and Jack tentatively accepts a buyout from Dick for 250 million dollars. Actually, this is a 1/4 of a billion over what he was worth to begin with, which was considerable. <br /> <br />The story is interesting and relentless. You won't want to put it down. Mr. Lupica knows sports, inside and out, and although the name dropping becomes tedious (does he really know all those people?) it does set a nice canvas upon which to paint his tale. Secondly, Mr. Lupica's dialogue gets better with each book and his conversations with African American players, goodoleboys from down south, and pretentious NFL Executives from 'Havahd' is as good as it gets. <br /> <br />The problem I have with the book is trying to get into the lifestyle of a billionaire and feel some empathy for him. I mean at a certain point, you want to say, \\"so what.\\" So he loses the team. So he was a meathead. He deserves to lose the team. So he loses the girl. He ignored her. He deserves to lose the girl. He was an idiot. Now he's an idiot with millions and millions of dollars. Hard to picture him as \\"Rudy\\" trying to make the team.  <br /> <br />If you get past that, great sports fix, funny, literate with gifted dialogue. Larry Scantlebury. 4 stars.	2004-09-07

Somewhere in Florence, perhaps in the Uffezi, stands a plaster of paris imprint of the mumified remains of a roman soldier, fleeing from the advancing lava of Vesuvius, trapped and immediately frozen in time by the sea of molten magma moving several hundred miles an hour. All for us to discover 2000 years later.<br /><br />What's interesting is the muscle tone of the back, the lats, the traps, the fingers outstretched, clawing, shocked. And of course the size . . . 'anatomically correct' an ad might read, 'but a foot and a half shorter.'<br /><br />I've always been struck by the similarity of those men and women, breasts, knuckles, toes, calves, really all the same as us.<br /><br />So that's where Harris takes us, and like Umberto Eco, we see one mystery atop another, atop another. And despite the excesses common to a barely regulated society, we meet the same kind of people, from the greedy and the cruel to the honest and the moral. The brave and the cowardly, the curious and the self absorbed.<br /><br />I found nothing to flaw this book. Writing historical novels is to take on an extra burden in the dialogue: What would the characters have said to eachother? So when the Aquarian Attilus confronts his feelings for the 18 year old Corrilia, there just aren't any self help books written on papyrus to give him any advice. Insight. Suggestions.<br /><br />Like David Robbins, and the aforementioned Eco, and Ken Follet writing his masterpiece of the building of the Cathedrals in Europe in the 9th c, Harris does a wonderful job in bringing us back to the time just following Nero, four days before the most well known volcano eruption before Mount St. Helens.

I still hold out for \\"Honor\\" and \\"Talbot\\" but \\"General's Daughter\\" is certainly in the top 3.<br /><br />Paul Brenner is a Warrant Officer, a W04, but his rank is limitless when 'on the job' so to speak. This means he can ask the hard questions of Officers of substantial rank. Enter Cynthia Sunhill, a Warrant of lesser rank (an 03 I think) and an ex-lover of Brenner, and when both are assigned to investigate murder most foul (and scandalous), you've got a great recipe for a tense, interesting mix.<br /><br />The two are assigned to investigate the murder of Captain Ann Campbell, an extraordinarily gifted Army Officer who led a not-so-secret, promiscuous alter life.<br /><br />Dialouge is as always witty and incisive. DeMille's own experiences in the Army gain him a leg up in the rich, three dimensional background. You start to like Brenner, see the confusion with him and his discomfort at working with a woman whom he admittdly loved, and who, not so admittedly, hurt him deeply. She says to him 'why didn't you fight for me? Wasn't I worth it?' And you know? That's a really good question we have to ask ourselves and Brenner has to ask himself.<br /><br />Good stuff.

What he is able to do is to balance an exquisite knowledge of flying skills and equipment and the men and women who use them, and as well detail an exciting story sprinkled with morality and humanity.<br /><br />  And I admire him because while he's got a sure fire winner in Jake Grafton et al., he remains unafraid to venture into new terrain.<br /><br />  Here he takes three stories, much like David Robbins' gifted novels about WWII, and weaves them in and out of the reader's scope of vision much so that we're really reading three stories at once. A prodigous task that Coonts handles well.<br /><br />  Whether or not such a horrific series of events could occur is in the mind of the writer. Novelists like John LeCarre and Len Deighton writing of the conspiracy of omission by the ABC Agencies forged in the 1980's could never have imagined what we would experience and the cost it would exact 20 years later. But that's the free reign we give our gifted writers. I shudder to think it would happen but the Fortunes of War kept me at a high level of adreneline.<br /><br />  Colonel Bob Cassidy, his Japanese friend Jiro, the Russian Skipper Saretov, Agent Ju, Chernoff, Dixie . . . we root for them and wonder at each encounter if they'll come out alive.<br /><br />  High praise for a novelist. Absolutely worth the time. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury	2004-07-26

He's left Alex Cross for awhile and now seems focused on Lindsay Boxer of the San Francisco P.D., home to Dirty Harry and Bullit so not a bad place to start. At the writing of this review I'm only at #1, and #s 2 and 3 still await me. After the aviary disaster of the 2 Beachhouses I swore off Patterson for awhile as to this reviewer, he was mailing in his name and what ever unfinished plot he happened to have lying around his home. Of course we were buying it so who really was to blame?<br /><br />This more typical of the former Patterson, violent crimes, smart but vulnerable investigators, and a couple of nice, unsuspected twists that fool us at the end.<br /><br />Kudos to the introduction of a mostly female wrecking crew. Done nicely. There seems to be good dialogue when they get together. I found the usual mortar between dialogue and the action to be lacking. I liked the Woman''s Murder Club conversations and imagined myself a fly on the wall; I liked the action of the plotting of the crime and the eventual fait accompli; I found the binding force between the two lacking, occasionally giving it a staggered effect. That was my only complaint.<br /><br /> I look forward to #2 and #3. 4 stars. Larry Scantlebury	2004-07-25

I resisted the characterization of Harry Niles as Rick Blaine and still to some extent continue to do so. He's more a character out of Hemingway, living in Paris or London or Madrid after the First World War. And like the Hemingway men, tragically flawed at several things save survival. For Harry is really the best at surviving.<br />Additionally I mistook the juxtaposition of the tales of Harry the scoundrel adult bar owner and Harry, the Charles Dickens street urchin as being whimsical at best, boring at worst. I was mistaken and seeing what Harry is and then seeing how he got there was fascinating and fulfilling.<br />This book grows on you, slowly at first, then by leaps and bounds. It is a mystery, romance, war story and to be truthful it went from &quot;interesting&quot; to &quot;riveting&quot; in about 200 pages.<br />Like all Cruz-Smith exploits, it is both well written while at the same time being very well researched. Other reviewers have given the plot so let me just leave you with this. In a strange (still) land at a time no one is too certain about what really went on, Cruz-Smith makes you feel at home.

The tenth book in the series that goes way back should not bowl you over as hard, maybe even more so, than the first. Yet &quot;The Narrows&quot; does just that.<br />Connelly tries other characters, he introduces different attitudes and issues, his characters don't always treat others well, but if I'm stuck in Newark Airport trying to get home . . .I'm heading to the 'C' section of fiction in the bookstore.<br />I'm not certain I like Harry. I mean, I like him, I just don't want him to be my next door neighbor. Too brooding. Too tough on himself and others. I have the feeling if I borrowed his lawnmower and didn't return it on the day I said I would, he'd mention it to my wife in an off handed way three years later.<br />I don't like the way he treats Buddy Lockridge for example. Buddy's an innocent scoundrel, true, but Harry uses him, abuses him and dumps him. And Rachel Walling, who might well be a female mirror image of Harry . . . he continually holds her to higher standards than he holds himself and blames her for doing things he himself does. But . . . .<br />But what an interesting character. Is there anyone like him in the genre today? Maybe Dave Robicheaux. Maybe early Spenser. Here Graciela, Terry McCaleb's widow, suspects Terry did not die of natural causes. Harry agrees to &quot;look into it&quot; but Connelly conveys a 'less than confident' Harry helping out the widow of a friend. Of course he's hooked like the Black Marlin Terry was trying to find on his last charter, trying to interpret the meaning of notes Terry wrote in the margin of a map, receipts on the floor of his jeep, puzzling over what certain photographs Terry kept on his computer meant.<br />I am fascinated by the successful intertwining of the two stories emanating from &quot;The Poet,&quot; that is the story of Harry and Rachel Walling, the defrocked FBI agent used as bait when the FBI suspects that possibly Bob Backus, the mentor of Rachel Walling and the serial killer who was the poet, is back. Rachel is like Bernard Samson in the Samson Trilogy by Deighton, guilty, tainted and exiled by association.<br />Connelly weaves back and forth with first person-third person narrative and never once in 400 pages stumbles. He feeds us clues and answers as we go along, not too many nor too much. The ending is pretty tight and the second ending a real surprise.<br />I liked especially the dialogue between Cherrie Dei and Walling over morphs and empats. Agents who track serial killers who deflect the horror into 'just a job' metality and'how can I spin this the best way for me?' are the morphs. And the empats, who are the better agents because suck it all in, can't stop the record from turning when the song is over. That's Rachel . . .and of course that's also Harry.<br />5 stars +.

Naturally, 'if done well' is the caveat.<br />Mr. Coonts does an admirable job here making the young, wisecracking Tommy Carmellini the bedrock about which to build &quot;Liars and Thieves.&quot; Kind of like an offshoot of successful television series in the '70's, Michael Connelly did this with the Harry Bosch and Terry McCaleb books.<br />This is a pretty good story reminiscent of a great old movie, &quot;3 Days of the Condor,&quot; where a CIA agent returns from buying coffee and donuts for his colleagues in a 'safehouse' (in the Robert Redford role) only to find every one of his colleagues has been murdered in the 15 minutes he was on the 'donut run.'<br />Here Tommy Carmellini is assigned guard duty at a CIA safe house only to stumble upon the killing of all of the occupants. The story starts off with a bang along with the natural, &quot;why?'<br />That Mr. Coonts keeps this from us for several hundred pages is a pretty good indication of the level of his skill. As I read along getting into the 300's, I still wasn't certain how he was going to tie it all together. Really, quite an interesting read that is a good mystery/airplane/train/beach/summertime novel.<br />Detracting from it were little oddities that I found . . .well, odd. It seems believable that the CIA would hire ex-felons to do their undercover/confidential informant work. I have trouble believing they would hire two of them and put them on the weekly payrole in their own offices inside the CIA castle.<br />Secondly, for a guy who professes love for a former colleague as much as Tommy does, he sure sleeps around a lot. I have no problem with that. It just seems Mr. Coonts is appealing to conflicting sides of individual natures.<br />The character of Tommy Carmellini is complex and he's a nice adjunct to the &quot;tough as a two dollar steak&quot; loyal Navy Vet, Jake Grafton. But, how can I say this? In &quot;Liars &amp; Thieves,&quot; he's on his own. Maybe he should be more focused and less like a fraternity boy. A fraternity boy with an M-5 automatic rifle. 4 Stars.

His \\"White Trilogy\\" is extraordinary. If you want a character that will plumb the depths of your soul, read about Jack Taylor in \\"The Guards.\\"<br />Here, in \\"Blitz,\\" a series of interconnected killings target police officers. Inspector Roberts is on compassionate leave, his wife having been killed in a traffic accident. Police Officer Falls, a Black woman police officer, befriends and is befriended by a young Aryan racist named 'Metal' with unpredictable consequences. And Sergeant Brandt finds himself teamed up with the openly gay Inspector (acting) Sergeant Porter Nash.<br />With an opportunity to make it into a West End comedy, Bruen modulates the heat so that a few guffaws are followed by a considerable chill as something disturbing is about to occur, followed by more witty dialogue.<br />You have to get used to his short staccato paragraphs and chapters. The dialogue is what gets you . . . abrubt statements followed by a Murphy's-law series of events.<br />If there is a criticism it is that in the Roberts-Brandt novels, there is not enough about Roberts or Brandt. Yet as I mentioned above, the story of Jack Taylor as told in \\"The Guards\\" shows great depth of character so if there is superficiality in Roberts-Brandt and they seem short of substance, it is by Ken Bruen's choice.<br />One of the best writers around.

It was powerful, sad, made you think, made you cry, moving, provocative. Excellent stuff. It was only to be surpassed by . . .<br />NYPD Blue. Just fantastic TV. That show would finish and you would let out a big sigh, unaware that you had been holding your breath. Pushing the limits. And of course, the key was Steven Bochco. He was the genius behind those TV serials that rocked us and socked us and won Emmys galore. That's what he did and does. And what this book shows is that what he's NOT is an author. There's a gushy \\"I love you man\\" comment by Steven Cannell. Well I hope so. Cannell's probably thinking, \\"I'm still the only guy in Hollywood writing books that people read!\\"<br />This book is a real letdown. The plot is a takeoff from Jimmy Stewart with a  broken leg caused by photographing the end of the Indianaplois 500, recuperating, sitting by his  . . . \\"Rear Window,\\" watching the lives of other people. Kind of voyeuristic, but heck it was 1954. Besides Jimmy was always well shaven and presentable. And he had a Brooks Brothers bathrobe on over his cast.<br />Enter Bobby Newman, who is by the very best accounts a self absorbed, drunk, self centered, nasty voyeur, playing with his telescope one night as he says 'just to see naked women' when, instead after a long and virtually pornographic sex act between two people, he sees a murder. And the plot goes on from there.<br />Did I say plot? OK. A series of barely connected vingettes. Tiny scenes from who knows where.<br />Every character is a comic book example of a promiscuous, foul mouthed, lying, trash talking, addicted to self abuse individual. There are no redeeming virtues in any of these characters. Each one, men and women alike, are emotional junkies. Even the cops whom you would think would have something of merit to offer since Bochco's heroes are detectives, are a huge letdown.<br />The dialogue, what little there is of it, is stilted, one dimensional, and meaningless. The only character worthy of note is Jelko, Bobby's agent, and he comes across as an unbelievable good guy, father of the year and faithful husband. I guess he's Mr. Bochco.<br />A big disappointment. Not worth the effort. Larry Scantleburyttle there is of it, is stilted, one dimensional, and meaningless.

He's also a man of integrity. His closest friend, Sam Vincent, also is a man of integrity. But it's a different kind of integrity. Not a different shade or a different color. Just an integrity based on a different set of rules.<br />There's a gritty scene in the movie &quot;The Untouchables&quot; where Sean Connery corners Kevin Costner, the idealistic Federal Cop who wants to get the mob, and Connery asks him, &quot;how far are you willing to go?&quot;<br />And that really is the difference between Vincent and Swagger. Vincent wants retribution, but he wants to do it legally. Swagger, the Congressional Medal of Honor winner from only six years before, wants to right horrid, terrible wrongs, but he's willing to do 'whatever it takes.'<br />Sam Vincent is on assignment for a 'Chicago Lawyer' when he's taken custody in the Thebes Mississippi Penal Farm, a backwater penitentiary built for African American inmates convicted of violent felonies. The dialogue used by the guards as well as Vincent and Swagger seems to be right out of the 50's and what I imagine it would sound like in rural, swampwater, bayou Mississippi.<br />Vincent gets caught investigating the Penal Farm and tossed in the lockup. Earl Swagger goes down to rescue him, and in the rescue he saves Vincent but gets caught. Beaten, whipped, crushed, nearly drowned, he escapes and goes back to right the wrongs he witnessed, suspected and were perpetrated upon him.<br />A little light on plot going from the possibly believable to the &quot;I can't believe this part&quot; however government conspiracy, mad Doctor and the crazed warden nevertheless, an exciting book. Good dialogue. Like all Hunter novels, pretty heavy on the violence. My favorite Hunter still remains &quot;Dirty White Boys,&quot; however the Swagger series, father and son, are top shelf reading excitement. 4 stars. Larry Scantlebury	2004-06-06

Drummond is asked to co-counsel with civilian Gay Rights specialist Katherine Carlson who asked for him directly. Although he hasn't seen her since law school 8 years earlier where they nearly came to fist fights on a daily basis for three years, it's apparent that she hates him loves him can't stand to be in the same room with him needs him, and Sean plays it well. If there's a hubris in Brian Haig's Sean Drummond, it's that he's too heroic and too intelligent to be such a buffoon when it comes to the opposite sex.<br />Here the plot floats in and out of two enormous issues, homosexuality and racism, and Haig treats both seriously, with Drummond coming to grips with both, particularly the former.<br />A very enjoyable read. Some of the tangential plot endings are telegraphed; some come as a surprise. I would like to see Drummond actually IN a trial. Mr. Haig brings us to the precipice in all of the (currently) four novels, but unlike Lescroart for one or Margolin, we never seem to get into the trial. Nevertheless good stuff. You might want to read them in order. The stories really stand on their own two feet but the maturation of Haig as a writer and Drummond as his lead character develop nicely over several years. 5 Stars. Larry Scantlebury	2004-06-06

Got to see if Ray Goldman, the brilliant chemist who has a hobby, yes, of being a gourmet cook on the side, is really guilty. Guilty of murder most foul, the slaughter of an innocent family.<br />Then we float into the arena of . . . golly, this doesn't make too much sense. People don't talk that way; You can't hide evidence from defense lawyers . . . ever; People don't rise to great heights who are sexist, painfully shy, impotent to act in their personal lives, buffoons.<br />Ray is convicted on the testimony of the sole survivor of the Faulkner family massacre, 15 year old Erin Faulkner. Seems she identified the voice of the masked assailant/psychopath, and it's Goldman. This catches the shy but brilliant attorney Ben Kincaid unawares because the evidence has never been turned over to the defense. Now granted, we readers aren't brilliant jurists but this is reversible error. This is mistrial city. This is prosecutorial misconduct. Makes no difference. Ray is sentenced to be executed.<br />Ray faces legal injection but doesn't want Ben interviewing his ex-girlfriend . . . .whom no one has ever interviewed. This seems odd. At least tell us that one of the troika, the cops, the DA or the Defense interviewed her. But no, like the lineup evidence, no one asked.<br />Mike Morelli, close friend of Ben's and in his own right a brilliant detective, attends the crime scene of Erin Faulkner's death hours after she tells Ben that she didn't really \\"know\\" it was Ray Goldman behind the ski mask, and Morelli concludes it was definitely . . . a suicide.<br />Morelli's relationship with Lisa Baxter, his beautiful partner, and for that matter Kincaid's relationship with Christina, his partner, is straight out of school . . . .Middle School.

I get the feeling there's a lot of Sergeant Mike Black in the story, both men from a disciplined life filled with a sense of honor. Both of these are integral parts to a character we can like. And I'll certainly read more of Mike Black's effort. In a plain filled with good but predictable authors such as Parker, Crais, George and DeMille, kudos to a new author.<br />But some of the things Ron Shade does are, well, goofy. He meets a girl that he knew a long time ago under vastly different circumstances, doesn't know where she's been for ten years, and then sleeps with her, not on the first date, on the first hour. Then he bemoans having had unprotected sex with her for the next 150 pages. His 'godfathers' on the Police Department who front him in his security agency treat him like a red haired stepchild. He shows up for an interview with a guy who can throw a lot of business their way  . . . . with a cat in his pocket. And his new girlfriend smokes, OK, kind of foolish I suppose in the new millenium, but he complains about it for another 100 pages.<br />So I like the guy. But come on. Grow up. Spenser and Elvis make boo boos too but they're pretty serious when it comes to their lives as well.<br />Anyhow, good book, confused main character, good gym scenes . . . if you're a gym rat Mike Black makes you feel an exhausting workout with the salt from the perspiration in your eyes.

I think that Mr. Deighton possibly felt that the first of the series was meant as a solo effort. Perhaps not. Both Berlin Game and Mexico Set stand on their own and could have been solo efforts; London Match is possibly the weaker of the three, but leaves us with that gritty taste in our mouths that recalls the anti-Bond stories of Harry Palmer, Bernard and the others.<br />The office wit characterized by working with management types unfamiliar with the &quot;field&quot; is not uncommon to many of us who spent time in the military or big corporations. We toil for those who have never experienced what they ask us to do. Hence Dickie Cruyer and Bret Rennselear. Of course for most all of us the result of the inequity of working for management is several antacid tablets; Bernard is quick to point out for him it may be death.<br />Len Deighton writes wonderful stories about the Cold War a long time ago.

But no doubt to some extent because of his father, Brian Haig has the knowledge of the inner circle or inner sanctum sufficient to make his plots believable and not far fetched.<br />And then there's Major Drummond, USA, JAG, courageous, witty, good sense of morals, completely irreverant, funny, relentless, and above all loyal.<br />Here's he's asked to represent a General Officer accused of treason. He's asked not by the General; both men hold eachother in contempt. He's asked by the General's wife. Seems that Sean got there first with the lovely, conniving Mary, who eventually dumped Sean to marry Bill. That's General Bill, now incarcerated in Leavenworth Military prison, charged with treason, adultery, and murder.<br />Mary did OK for herself, too, rising where few women succeed, in the tesosterone infected CIA. Haig has no love for the CIA or the FBI or the NSC, all places he is quite familiar with. What Drummond has to prove is, if it isn't his non-friend Bill, then who sold secrets to the Russians?<br />Remarkably, albeit now Russia is vodka drenched run by the Mafiya, we do believe that they still have millions of nuclear warheads at least some of them unaccounted for. Sean hooks up (well not really but professionally) with Katrina, a lawyer of high intellect and no resume, and the two catfight through several hundred pages in the defense of their client. She's a good match for Drummond as the two survive assination attempts, disrspecting eachother, and a sense of loyalty to eachother.<br />If I had a criticism it would be that I enjoyed some of the other Drummond stories where he has more contact with his superiors in JAG.

Historians must have a point of view that accompanies the facts they present, as do newspapers or (I feel unsettled saying this)television reporters. So it is not uncommon say, in the form of the American Civil War, that Kenneth Davis has his own axe to grind. This is good, as long as the reader is left with enough evidence to differentiate between fact and opinion. Or as the old Memorex commercial with Ella Fitz spoke, \\"what's real and what's Memorex?\\"<br />Certainly, that this nation spoke in lofty terms and yet kept slaves is the haunting near inexplicable anomaly of our history, one that today continues to chafe, cause tears, violence and still be misunderstood. Professor Davis has an interesting quote from Freud where Freud supposedly says, \\"Thank you for sharing with me the high minded values and lofty standards of men. Now let me introduce you to the basement.\\"<br />Unless you were lost in disreality as a youngster and your parents sent out a missing persons alert, you must of guessed somewhere along the line in school that when teachers told us that the causes of the Civil War (which for starters killed close to three quarters of a million) had everything to do with anything other than slavery, they were the ones that had lost their sense of reality. Certainly slavery was the root cause of the terrible carnage and it is certainly refreshing to have someone of Davis' stature confirm that. As Davis says, without slavery, there is no war.<br />Yet at some point his bias seems innundated with the good guys versus the bad guys, and we end up reading chapter after chapter describing virtually everyone north of Kentucky and all Quakers being good, and anyone south of Kentucky being stand-ins for Harriet Stowe's 'Simon Legree.' Ain't necessarily so.<br />Another jarring issue is the recitation of the facts before each chapter that Professor Davis wishes to present, followed by the repetition of those same facts at the end of the chapter. For many of us the textbook style of writing was something we gratefully left behind in college and high school.<br />Having said all that, like David Howarth in the UK, Kenneth Davis has a pleasant style of prose that gets us to read things we ought to have read earlier on. And he does it well. As Maya Angelou once wrote of Oprah Winfrey, 'I don't like all of the books she puts on 'her  list,' but at least she gets people to read.'<br />And Kenneth Davis gets us to take a hard look at history, and how we got here.

Being in touch with the south and most of all, with the beauty of the flora and the fauna, it's impossible not to be moved with his travelogue detailing of what grows there and why it stopped growing there.<br />Joining that is Mr. Burke's appreciation for the past, and how his hero, Dave Robicheaux, father, husband, RVN vet, alcoholic, cop, reminds us that we are forever responsible for the consequences of our acts.<br />Finally there is Dave wrestling with his addictions, cognizant that it really is one day at a time, and he better not try to fill the one gallon bucket with five gallons of \\"stuff.\\"<br />Great list of characters: Legion Guidry, the Darth Vader of this novel, his wondeful wife Bootsie, recidivist offender Jimmy Dean Styles, gifted but terminally flawed Tee Bobby, and of course his best friend Clete Purcell.<br />We get more out of the friendship of the two men here in \\"Jolie Blon's Bounce\\" than before and begin to understand why the two men are together as a pair, through hard times and good times and why Dave always sticks with Clete even though it's a brotherhood of only two.<br />On it's own it's a great book with moments of humor, sadness, the continual racial agony that haunts especially the south, and the wonderful prose of Mr. Burke, and doesn't require any of the other Robicheaux novels to support it.<br />If there is a drawback it is that with each successive Robicheaux tale, the writing becomes to some extent recipe or formula oriented. There's a killing most gruesome, a conflict in his marriage, a flirtation with drinking, ribald storytelling with Clete and retribution for the bad guys and vindication for the good guys. But like Parker's Spenser, I'll keep on reading him. Larry Scantlebury 5 stars.	2004-05-01

This seems to be a missed point; I don't read for the plot. I think that Elmore Leonard is a master of how people speak. The real people. Not television people. People like you and me. Or at least the people like you and I hear speaking.<br />Interestingly enough, Mr. Paradise does have an interesting plot with two young women who find themselves in a gig with an old lawyer (read mob figure), Tony Paradiso (\\"Mr. Paradise.\\") Tony is offed and one of the girls with him. The other faces a substantial fortune  . . .  if she can assume her dead friend's identity.<br />But then the Detective in charge, the handsome and widowed Frank Delsa, falls in love with her and she, perhaps . . . seems to . . . maybe . . . falls in love with him.<br />Great action, kind of sexy, and excellent dialogue.

This book, well maybe Native Tongue and Skin Tight to a greater extent, will get the elderly out of your row of seats in the airport gate area and mothers herding their children protecting them from the lunatic laughing  a few seats away. Because Hiaasen is that funny. You have a little of that with Brian Haig and more of it with Elmore Leonard. But Hiaasen makes you guffaw, wheeze and eventually wipe the tears from your eyes.<br />That these people are fantasy people is no more apparent than the educated Erin Grant showing more than her heart to make ends meet. But that's OK because the circumstances, albeit ridiculous, call for it.<br />Not much to talk about in plot. There is a strong message about the 'agent oranging' of the Florida environment. And it's not an insignificant message. But the real aspect of the book and unless I'm mistaken all of the books is their ribald humor and ability to make you laugh. 4 stars.

I don't expect to remember any quotes, won't laugh too hard, never shed a tear, chuckle at Bacchetti's New York humor, and try (hard to do) to keep track of the women.

And I can't say Ms. Johansen doesn't do a great job with it. But for me, the characters have to be credible and believable and if I am to have some identification with them, they have to feel as I would or at least, convince me to feel as they do.<br />Joe Quinn and John Logan seem to act like neanderthals around Eve. Acting like High School jocks in the football locker room at half time might even make more sense.<br />The woman Eve, a forensic facial reconstructionist, has had her daughter murdered, halucinates, is either having a breakdown or should be on meds, is about to put herself in the cross hairs of the insane serial killer Dom, and her two &quot;best friends&quot; are doing the testosterone tango. Tedious. Boring. Stupid. I can't believe caring men would act that way. And Eve is no better. The most dialogue the reader gets is the dialogue she has with herself and then, the lengthy conversations she has with her daughter.<br />I know Ms. Johansen is highly regarded and I am willing to assume these are my failings. It's just that everytime I started to like Logan and Quinn, they started behaving like cartoon figures. Sorry. 3 Stars. Larry Scantlebury	2004-04-19

A similar comment could be made of James Dickey's &quot;Deliverance.&quot;<br />Yet for me it is the beauty of Dickey's prose that rears it's head repeatedly reminding us all of his brilliance as a poet and a writer. The descriptions of the wilderness so close to the &quot;civilized world&quot; are enchanting, seductive. And when we see what the 4 businessmen have to do to survive the law of the wilderness and then in a brilliant piece of irony, the law of the civilized world, we wonder who transformed who.<br />The 4 men, all friends of varying degrees of kinsmanship, agree to a whitewater camping trip in Georgia on a section of the river soon to be dammed up, never to exist again. It's a last taste of this portion of Mother Nature. Lewis Medlock, the strongest of the group in his mental acuity and survival instincts as well as his physical prowess is the natural leader of the group.<br />Things don't turn sour immediately but then they go downhill fast. A chance meeting with violent 'mountain men' leads to murder, or is it self defense? That leads again to another killing, and the men are faced with dealing with issues, moral and physical, that they never imagined.<br />Lewis had prophesied to Ed Gentry in the first chapter of Dickey's masterpiece that 'the line between civilization and survival is very thin' and then asks Ed what would he do if he found himself on 'the other side?'<br />Of course that's what he does after Lewis is savagely injured, and Ed Gentry must take over if any are to remain. Excellent, brilliant movie; better book. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury	2004-04-12

Hitler	This is a very good mystery-thriller, painted on the canvas of the doomed Berlin, and subsequently, doomed mid-twentieth century Europe. It carries with it some of the sadness of the wonderful Alan Furst novels, true to the time and the despair of the Armageddon our forefathers were powerless or impotent or too ignorant to avoid.<br />Harry Wulff, the last man standing, is a successful detective wanting only to protect the people, the Berliners, from lawbreakers. Of course behind Wulff are the raging battles of the Nazi Party, the communists, as well as the criminals. This is Berlin in 1931 and 1932. Hitler is not Chancellor yet and the Reichstag has yet to be burned.<br />His love of his partner Johanna, who won't marry him because she is Jewish, his loyalty to his friend Barlach, and his devotion to his father is touching and grounds him. We are dealing with an honorable man in dishonorable surroundings.<br />Hot on the trail of a psychopath he seeks the advice of Johanna, much like Spenser seeks the advice of Susan Silvermann. But Spenser survives and Harry is left almost on the brink of madness himself.<br />There was for me almost too much sex and a great deal of it was lurid and uncomfortable. The pschopath kills tranvestites; there is more than a hint of his incestuous upbringing; the Nazis use prostitutes with special skills.<br />Yet Dold writes a compelling novel and I will read him again, and probably again. 4 stars.

There, I've said it. He takes simple men, surely John Miller, Captain, 2nd Ranger Battalion is just that, a simple man, and paints a canvas of such detail of Armageddon, putting these simple men all over the painting. Hell. The end of the world. Good versus evil. Call it what you may. &quot;I'm a history teacher,&quot; he says in the movie in one extraordinarily tense scene. &quot;I teach history in a small high school in Pennsylvania. . . .when I'm done here I don't know if I can go back to it.&quot;<br />I'm reminded of another 'simple man' that came from Pennsylvania in novel lore. Lieutenant Harry Brubaker, the lawyer who flies F-9 Panther Jets in Michner's brief story about the carnage in Korea, 'Bridges at To Ko Ri.'<br />But the point is Spielberg tells us that they were all simple men and we don't believe him at first. We keep looking for  Arnie Schwarznegger or Chuck Norris or The Rock. But they are and were normal guys, guys from Brooklyn New York and Brooklyn Michigan. Guys from towns you never heard of in Iowa, where Jimmy Ryan and his brothers came from. Just guys in the greatest carnage the world ever knew. And Spielberg shows us what they did. They changed the world.<br />The five Sullivan brothers all went down with their ship in the middle of the war and after that the powers that be would not commit one brother in a theater of combat where another brother was also serving in harm's way. So here, one of Jimmy Ryan's brothers is killed in the Pacific and one brother is killed in Anzio Beach. And Sean Ryan is killed in the landing at Omaha Beach. And Captain John Miller and a squad of men he picks are asked to find him to send him home.<br />A wonderful book to compliment a movie that should be preserved forever about an ubelievable body of men and women. &quot;Was I a good man,&quot; asks James Ryan 50 years later?

There are several other 'books turned into series' that depict friendship and loyalty but on those occasions, they sometimes fall into dialogue loaded with humorous repartee. The excellent (yet limited) series of Spenser of course is always about friendship and loyalty, although I am certain that Professor Parker would agree that Aubrey and Maturin represent a far more prodigous, complicated  effort than Spenser and Hawk.<br />&quot;The Thirteen Gun Salute&quot; takes the crew of The Diane well, well south into frozen waters, battles typhoons, carries with it political intrigue, but mostly immerses us in the lexicon and morality of 200 years ago. By now all who are but a little familiar with Lucky Jack Aubrey know that it is his friendship with Dr. Maturin and the ensuing conversations that make the series fly . . . well, float. Add to that the close, uncanny description of life on board a sailing ship and the tumult of the time resounding with the French, here Malay Sultans, protestants, Catholics and revolutionaries, and you're in for a great, enjoyable history lesson.<br />Some criticize O'Brian for being tedious. For the rest of us it is why we are there. It is O'Brian's attention to detail from eating pudding before the rats get it to gunnery practice in the late afternoon that makes it all worthwhile. Highly recommended. Thirteen Guns and Five Stars. Larry Scantlebury	2004-04-03

This probably is a sufficient enough review. But the reason, I think, that we love him and all of his smugness and predictability and relentless search for truth and Ms. Silverman is just that, it is good, it is fair, and like the old John Wayne movies, it's big. Maybe bigger than life.<br />We get older and we don't have heroes anymore. Politicians? Seems kind of silly, doesn't it? Professional athletes get indicted by the Federal Courts, ex-sports icons shoot people.<br />There are judicial inquiries into drugs, sex, violence, and  betting. Movie stars get up and tell us about the war. We're down to beer commercials.<br />And then there's Spenser. Solid. Available. Proposing, then disposing. There's a funny scene here where the sexual predator Adele is discussing with Susan how odd it is to see the relationship between Hawk and Spenser and Vinnie. Susan says 'there are more of them,' and then names Belson, Quirk, Chollo, Fortunato, Farrell, Teddy Sapp, Bobby Horse, Healy.\\"<br />Then pretty Adele asks what may be the perfect question and answer to all of us who have followed Spenser for thirty years. Adele says asking of Susan, how Susan knows Hawk will be at a certain dangerous place in the next few hours, and Susan says, \\"because he said so.\\"<br />There's still another reason why we follow him around decade after decade and it's the lyrical quality of Parker's prose. Early on in a sober moment Spenser is talking to Susan in Kennebunkport, Maine. While she talks he looks out at the shoreline, then the water. You can see him there, with his soulmate, listening but nonetheless taking it all in. He thinks \\"The movement of the immediate water dragged me outward toward a bigger and bigger seascape until I felt the near eternal presence of the ocean far past the horizen.\\"<br />That's it for me. He never lets me down. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury	2004-03-29

This is is first Hunter novel I read albeit some years ago, and it still maintained that breathy, scary look beneath a rock. Hunter's able to conjure up that fear you had as a young kid about things that go bump in the night in places you wish your parents hadn't left you.<br />The book is about a jailbreak and the relentless pursuit by a lawman. The convicts are evil and the lawman is heroic . . . not. The chase is violent, strewn with errors of judgment, passionalte and frightful.<br />The best thing about Hunter's characters is that heroes are flawed and villains, well they have hopes and dreams, too. This is not unlike some of the characters in George Pelecanos' Washington D.C., and an argument could be made in the same manner for Jimmy and Sean, two boyhood friends on either side of the law in Lehane's masterpiece, &quot;Mystic River.&quot;<br />The point is we all get a little tired of the 'Wyatt Earp as an avenging angel and Ike Clanton as the personification of evil' atypical description of the good guys versus the bad guys. Humans aren't at all like that, at least the ones most of us know, and we tire of reading about people that couldn't exist.<br />Good writing; very violent; noble in a raw sort of way. 5 stars.

Here, in &quot;Hard Revolution,&quot; he takes us back in the day to when Derek Strange, connoiseur of R&amp;B, rock and blues, a wealth of information on sports, and an Orwellian 'hard man,' began.<br />As a young boy he is, like all of us, influenced by well meaning but nevertheless flawed people, but Derek is able to love those flawed people and learn from their virtues as well as their flaws. He doesn't give up on the message because the messenger has clay feet.<br />He looked up to his older brother for years but even as a youngster he sees his brother making bad choices. When years later Dennis is murdered, Derek is a Police Officer taking it on the chin from white racists as well as 'his own people,' some of whom have pegged him as an 'Uncle Tom.' But he promises to right his brother being wronged, even if by doing so he must give up some of his accomplishments. Doing what he has to do may be mutually exclusive to the life he now leads.<br />Passion and the tension bubble and boil. Yet Pelecanos is able to do what few others have done in the novel genre: he shows the beauty of the race, either race, along with individual flaws. Because these are heady conflicts that we fought then in 1968 and now 35 years later. And a man or woman on the other side of the racial divide can be silenced with an albeit appropriate criticism of a brother, or of a sister's criticism of a caucasian man.<br />Yet Pelecanos has his hero apologizing when his partner points out 'he only had to ask' about an issue that Derek 'thought he knew it all.'There are African American men who are Homeric, yet flawed, and there are Caucasian men who are Neanderthals, but Homeric.<br />Excellent book. A book Pelecanos had to write to make sense of his assortment of characters 30 years later. (Man, how does he dredge up those songs from the early '60's? It's like a trip down Route 66 in your '57 Chevy with the top down and three on the tree.) 5 stars. Larry Scantleburyhe dredge up those songs from the early '60's?

The story opens with Dicky Cruyer cursing at a pedestrian in a Mexico trafic jam. Interestingly enough, Mr. Deighton shows us the pedestrian 400 pages later to see if we've been paying attention.<br />Samson, a professional MI-6 field operative, is devastated by the defection of his wife, Fiona, to the other side. Read KGB. Read the evil empire. To all that ask him 'if he still loves her' he denies he does. But Mr. Deighton leaves any number of clues for his readers to make us know that at best, it's just false bravado.<br />Handicapped somewhat emotionally by the strain of realizing that their whole marriage, the children, the shared experiences was but a stage she played upon, Bernard must also face the onslaught of accusatory hearings from his employers at London Central, the 'deskmen' lacking any field experience where hard men do the hard things that he hates so much.<br />We see the old characters Frank Harrington, the Iago-like Dicky, the self serving Bret Rensselaer, and his close friend for life Werner Volkmann and Volkmann's straying wife, Zena.<br />Deighton's humor is subtle and droll. When faced with a dilemma Dicky says &quot;Muy BLOODY complicado,&quot; Bernard thinks 'that's only because he doesn't understand.'<br />Blood is spilt, sometimes innocent blood, sometimes not so innocent. Bernard is loyal, confused, older, tripped up by forces that should be aiding him but who have their own agendas. Erich Stinnes, the KGB officer who interrogated him in East Berlin says to him, &quot;I hate deskmen.&quot; Samson replies &quot;Me too. They're bloody dangerous.&quot;<br />Excellent read about the life and death struggles of the alphabet agencies of the 70's and 80's. You don't have to read Berlin Game first but it helps.

An old fashioned hanging judge, he makes State's Attorneys relax, police witnesses calm down, and defendants shiver. He's also kind a promiscuous man, chasing women with utter disregard for the EEOC and HR. Along comes Kathy Baker, a DOC (Department of Corrections) Probation Officer. She's like many of the Leonard heroines, attractive, gritty and while not amoral clearly someone willing to go all the way to get her man. This is excellent news for Sergeant Gary Hammond, one of the good guys. The bad news for Elvin Crowe and his nephew Dale, two lifetime, recidivist convicts, is that she also means them.<br />The alligator, Dickey Campeau, Leanne, Earlene, Dr. Tommy, Wesley and Hector all add to the United Nations mish-mash of dysfunction, crime, love and humor.<br />The dialogue, always a Leonard strong suit, gets better and better. Unfortunately, the plot seems unfocused. It takes a long time to get up a head of steam. We keep floundering around the set-up. What's Elvin going to do? What's Gary going to do? Is Leanne coming home? Is there a second alligator?

All of them, father, son, friends, associates, enemies, all are cloaked in varying degrees of despicability. All are tainted by greed, and that his friends who profited so greatly by Carter's greed return a portion of their gold to Carter to soften his eventual fall from grace, or the return of his true love, Rebecca, you still don't like any of them. At least I didn't. Like the lovely sirens in myth singing seamen to watery graves, Clays meteoric rise to wealth is surpassed equally by his  meteoric fall.<br />Grisham paints a dreary picture of the moral ambivalence of the legal profession, but unlike his characters in The Firm and Pelican, none rise above their greed. Clay is corrupted by his greed and in turn corrupts his friends. If you listen closely you'll hear Pink Floyd's chorus, 'money, money, money, money.'<br />It's a good story and shouldn't be ignored. Mr. Grisham may be getting truly cynical however because while there was always a 'one good lawyer' character in his earlier works, we are really left with Grisham's indictment, there may be 'no good lawyers.'<br />I hope that's not true. At least one would like to believe it isn't true. If there is a weakness in the book, it is simultaneously a long, long walk to get across the street while at the same time the climax lacks any real retribution. Living the rest of your life in London with the girl of your dreams surrounded by great theater and tremendous Rugby sure beats the heck out of five years in prison.<br />Maybe 100 pages shorter would have made it less of an effort.

US	39425588	R1RJ6M5M1BAYTG	0446531782	514796291	Private Sector	Books	5	1	1	N	N	One of the best.	I have high praise for Brian Haig's \\"Private Sector\\" and his character, Sean Drummond. I am reminded of two books, John Grisham's \\"The King of Torts\\" and Nelson DeMille's \\"The Lion's Game.\\"<br />The former 'King of Torts' comes to mind because of the seduction of money. Here, albeit unlikely, Drummond is the antithesis of what the staid Washington corporate lawfirm he joins represents, when he is given a chance to participate in a 'lend lease' program initiated by the Armed Forces. Drummond is a rough and tumble JAG attorney and stumbles around the lawfirm insulting venerated partners, offending women with copies of the latest EEOC decisions clutched to their chests, and generally if not being a pain in their behinds, at least a thorn in their sides. But one thing Major Drummond doesn't fool around with is his loyalty to his friends. So when his associate in JAG Lisa Morrow is murdered in a botched parking lot robbery at the Pentagon, Drummond begins to link apparently unrelated clues. And, unlike Clay Carter in 'Torts,' he is shamelessly uninterested in money. As he digs deeper he is offered millions to \\"join\\" the firm however he remains undeterred and steadfast in his goal, finding Lisa's killer wherever it leads him.<br />Drummond hooks up with Warrent Officer Daniel Spinelli, sort of a Dennis Franz character not unlike Detective Supawitz in NYPD Blue. Drummond reminds me of John Corey in 'The Lion's Game' because he is one of the funniest private eyes (so to speak) since Corey was created by DeMille. I have to admit I laughed out loud on more than a few occasions.<br />A very good read and highly recommended. Five stars. Larry Scantlebury	2004-02-27

This is a very well written mystery which contains all the aspects of current conspiracy and murder on the stage of the most ancient mystery. 'The Last Temptation of Christ,' 'The Last Supper,' 'King of Kings' notwithstanding, Dan Brown is really on safe ground here. I mean, we can't even puzzle out the shot from the grassy knoll fifty years ago. How could we possibly unravel clues lost for two thousand years in the sands of antiqity over Christ's human life?<br />Mr. Brown presents a murder in the Louvre that takes the characters across three continents to a violent conclusion, with nothing really lost or gained.<br />If we thought we would know more at the end then we knew at the beginning, we are happily, I suppose, disappointed. Mr. Brown through Robert Langdon conjures up a remarkable story, but those critical of the church and those supportive of the church fail to uncover any more grist for their mills. And that's the beauty of Brown's writing. He takes a story we all heard at varying points of our adolescence, presents it beautifully, and keeps our attention throughout. It really is, forgetting the topic, a very compelling story.<br />Worth the effort. Larry Scantlebury	2004-02-27

Frankly, I can't see it.<br />Boston Superior Court Judge Barbara Pitt has an affair with her Law Clerk, some 25 years or more her junior. The Law Clerk disappears during the sensational pedophile trial of a former catholic priest, Father Cornelius Dooley, and Pitt enlists the aid of her 'former' lover, Sheldon Gold, a noted Boston attorney with an investigative staff. Pitt, while pining for her lost love clerk continues to invite Gold to her bed. Are you with me so far?<br />Gold has three assistants, the beautiful but scarred Irish Mairead O'Clare, gay ex-street savvy Boston tough guy ex-cop Pontifico Murrizi, and African American receptionist, sage, font of wisdom, soothsayer, attorney without the JD, Billie Sunday.<br />Can we get anymore eclectically diverse in our personal issues? Can we stereotype differing people in any other way? Oh. I forgot to mention that Shelly Gold is under a prescription for heavy anti-depressants and his 'wife' is in a care facility for grave, violent attacks of psychosis.<br />Here are the 4 reasons why this book left me cold and even a little disturbed.<br />First of all the characters 'speechify.' The don't talk to eachother, they give speeches. About the church, politics, homosexuality, adolescent scarring, \\"swinging,\\" Catholics, on and on. People don't talk that way. An occassional rant, OK? 300 pages of it? Tedious.<br />Secondly. The church gets slammed. OK. Is this a Dan Rather expose or a novel? I firmly believe that it flirts with personal bias. If you want to take on that topic, give some balance. We are left with numerous \\"speeches\\" that the church is filled singularly with pedophiles, homosexuals and alcoholics. Cheap shot. Untrue. Yellow journalism.<br />Thirdly, for all they rant about, the characters are superficial. I know less about Mairead O'Clare, certainly the strongest character of the dysfunctional quartet, on page 295 than I did on page 1.<br />Finally, I find it boring to have these 1 and 2 page chapters. It's like flitting around with the remote control. Lots of pictures; no substance.<br />A poor book riding the tide of sensationalism and tragedy.

It has pathos, the breakup of the lovely, artistic Robin and Dr. D; it has confusuion in new loves, for both, it has great dialogue between the angry Petra and the new Eric; it has just the hint of things to come without readers being able to say &quot;I knew it!&quot;; and of course it has 'murder most foul' and not one and not two and not three but four reasonable perps.<br />When we have a series that has withstood the test of time, Crais' Elvis and Joe, Parker's Spenser and Hawk come to mind,  there's bound to be an occasional letdown. Some authors like Lehane merely stop, saying, inter alia, &quot;I don't want to do these folks anymore.&quot; (I kind of miss Patrick and Angie.)<br />But we as readers can't have it both ways. The alternative to us knowing every nuance of the protagonist(s) (this is #17 for Alex and Milo) is cessation. I don't want that; I'll take the once-in-awhile predictable storyline.<br />This isn't it. Someone is killing the artists, blues musicians, dancers, potters, painters, and the only clue in a limited field is that the victims appear to have won it all, lost it all, and are making a comeback.<br />Great dialogue, nice characters, good dose of unpredictability. Highly recommended. Five stars. Larry Scantlebury	2004-02-10

I know what I'm getting into.<br />If I read Follett or Koontz or Patterson, when time after time in recent years they have shown me they just mail it in, I'm the fool.<br />Bird children. OK.

No, I'll pass.<br />Jumping from one ambush to another? How do they do it? So much wasted dialogue and so few (if any explanations). How do the hunters know where the prey are? How do they find them? They're genius birds, after all. The adults speak like children (\\"Hugs and Kisses. Hugs and kisses. Coo Coo Coo.\\") And the children speak like no child I ever heard. The plot is unbelievable. The interconnecting scenes without bridges. The conversations without any basis in reality, suspended or actual. The facts are MIA. In the second to the last scene the characters we have come to love (or rather just put up with) are facing certain death. In the next scene, they are free! This is not David Copperfield.

And in his line of work that's a definite drawback. No EEOC here to preclude discrimination against the over 40 crowd. Here getting older might mean your death.<br />Samson worries about all of the things all of us do. His passion for his wife Fiona is often visited by equal doses of lust and insecurity. His car is shot; when is going to be able to pick up his new set of wheels? His boredom with the job and his immediate superiors are both frustrating and funny. One thing is clear, though, Bernard Samson holds loyalty above all. When he was much younger and the East German Police were closing in on him, a planted agent whom we know now only as \\"Brahms Four\\" comes back to get him, and saves Bernard's life. Now years later, that anonymous agent wants out and he wants Bernard to bring him out.<br />Carrying all the boredom of a careful precise job where to err is not human but terminal, Samson plots and plods to regain the mettle to cross the line into East Berlin and extract his friend. Bernard is of course in his own right, an excellent spy.<br />Bernard Samson is like Harry Palmer in The Ipcress File, the antithesis of the sleek, flashy James Bond. The normal man or woman caught up in the spy game, not necessarily of their own choosing, trying to get through another dreary, scary day.<br />The writing is excellent. Double crosses, infidelities, triple crosses, humor and lies frequent this is a trip into the past where authors like Deighton, LeCarre and DeMille cut their teeth, in the evil Russian Empire post WWII spy network.<br />If you liked Charm School or other works set in the shadow of the Berlin Wall when Russia was the reincarnation of the Nazi Empire, you'll thoroughly enjoy this trip back to the early '80s, and the first of Deighton's Bernard Samson trilogy.<br />Five stars.

It reminded me of Jeffrey Deaver in that the dialogue is crisp, the action substantial and the \\"New York kinda' attitude\\" ever present. Barrington must service the sleazier side of one of his lawfirm's clients, and while I am sure that it goes on, it might be odd that the \\"of Counsel\\" on the letterhead is tasked with this responsibility.<br />In any event the job is botched but one poor photograph of the encounter between a straying husband (of the client) and a \\"masseuse\\" appears to be the face of an international chameleon-like assassin (get ready for the play on words) code name \\"La Biche.\\"<br />This starts an exciting ball rolling that creates a series of murders, sex, but no Rock 'n Roll. You'll have to see George Pelecanos for that. Nonetheless, while perhaps not riveting certainly a great airplane read, and at a minimum, magnetic. The only portion I found truly unbelievable was Barrington's moralizing at the end. I mean he's a lawyer for God's sake.<br />At any rate, good stuff. I'll read more of Mr. Woods and take advantage of some of the readers' citations to other good Barrington tales. Four stars. Larry Scantlebury	2004-02-01

Giving him a 10 year sentence, cognizant of the joy Mercury Morris had brought the Dolphins and their Miami fans, the Judge said, &quot;Sorry Merc.&quot;<br />Of course, football afficianados were saddened by the sentence. What had happened? How did he suddenly fall? It must have been overnight because he was such a wonderful running back.<br />How does it happen that we lose sight of our heroes, are deaf to their problems, ignorant of the huge crash when the stands empty forever?<br />It starts with the Permian Panthers, a High School football team in Odessa, Texas in the late '80's.<br />Bissinger's book remains the quintesential 'not-feel-good-story' about high school sports. Nothing bad happens, there are no pregnancies, DUI's, deaths or shootings, but there are worse things. There is the false society that these young (for the most part) men live. The adulation. The absence of no other alternative other than what they have been taught as the only way out of poverty, boredom, and the greatest punishment of all, anonimity. We are all enablers. While Bissinger aims at the coaches we would have to include school officials, town leaders, fans, ourselves.<br />Extremely well written I picked it up again as in this year, as we closed in on the College Football Championships with all the controversy of &quot;who is the real winner?&quot;<br />Of course the whispered answer may be, do we really need one? Is there any point before professional sports that the joy of the game remains the joy of the game?<br />The parents of all high school children, ex-athletes, sports lovers, kids, and couch potatoes should read Bissinger.

One imagines almost a sullen Steve McQueen-like character, Mitchell never had a recollection of how the crime actually happened since he's a black out binge drinker. We are left to imagine that it was the circumstantial testimony of the victim and Mitchell's good mate, Billy Norton, that get him the sentence.<br />He gets out and tries to go straight but there's an entire cadre of people who keep setting up roadblocks for him. Billy meets him after his release and wants him to go into the loan shark collection business with him. Briony, his lovely sister, keeps telling him that she and her husband Frank will meet him for dinner, but Frank's been dead for 5 years. And Lillian, the aging actress who hires him to be a handyman on her enormous estate, wants him to be full service handyman. All this while he finds true love in Aisling, who loves him and wants to marry him, and in all of this confusion . . . he does too.<br />Ken Bruen is like James Crumley, high praise for both. There are no sensitive remarks between buddies and it's sure not written for the movies. It's a stark, tough life. Not everybody makes it and those that do are never the same.<br />The publishing is of poor quality, with occasional improper spacing, incorrect punctuation, missing periods, reverse quotation marks.

I say trilogy but there really is no connection except the chronology of historical events. The coherence of the three novels is in the relentless cause and effect of the World at War on millions of lives in the war as well as those bystanders and families.<br />Robbins has been criticized for the splintering effect of all of the individual stories, for included in &quot;The End of the War&quot; are representations of/from Stalin, Churchill and Roosevelt. I feel such criticisms are subjective at best because what we have here is an epic about something of epic proportions. When you have technology combined with will so advanced that 10,000 men can die in a single six-hour battle, perhaps what we need is to have multiple views to help us understand in the larger sense of the word, what happened.<br />For those of us reluctant to bick up a treatise by Barbara Tuchman, Cornelius Ryan, Doris Kearns or Max Hastings, David Robbins offers a compromise.

Charlie suffered the cruelest punishment of all, to be left alive after his wife and daughter were brutally murdered. It is now a year later, coming up on the anniversary of his family's death, and Charlie can't exorcise the demons, wants to try a new life with a lovely woman he met in a previous novel (Rachel), and generally wants to get some peace of mind. He's moved into his Grandfather's old home in Scarborough, Maine and is now refurbishing it.<br />But as we learn after a few dozen pages, Charlie, an alchohlic who gives up the bottle, also gives up any moral restraint against the concept of killing criminals. He becomes overnight a one man angel of death with no desire to curb his bloodlust when faced with the possibility that a murderer or rapist could possibly be freed by a confusing, liberal, system that favors the rights of the accused over the rights of the victem.<br />While this sounds like poor pulp fiction, several things occur that Mr. Connolly successfully weaves into the fabric of his prose to make it quite engaging. First of all, Connolly writes extremely well. There is an almost musical quality to his prose, heretofore only experienced (for this reader) with James Lee Burke in this type of novel. Additionally, Mr. Connolly introduces some oddities that seem to fit. Charlie is contacted by the dead, and while the body count rises, he seems to regret what he does while on the same hand he seems to listen to what his deceased wife and daughter tell him. That line from a Bruce Willis movie a few years ago comes true here: He sees dead people.<br />Then, there is the presence of his two friends and quasi partners, the gay couple Louis and Angel. Strange, but it fits.<br />Here he works as a private investigator working for a woman stalked by her ex-husband. The woman and her son are murdered, the ex-husband is suspected, and naturally Charlie \\"Bird\\" Parker is the only one that doesn't believe it.

Rhythm and Blues, Chief Inspector Roberts and Sergeant Brandt, R&B, serve the Queen and the nation in southeast London, a very tough part of the world. They face a variety of professional issues and personal crises. Not to say the least of which is a murdering criminal force that they are asked to keep in check.<br />These are three short stories written between 1998 and 2000, joined together in 2003. The stories relate to eachother and while the joinder is not seamless, Bruen's writing is sufficiently jolting so that the stories feel contiguous.<br />Bruen writes like the fifties. You see Mickey Spillane and Phillip Marlowe. Tough stuff. Great dialogue. He writes sharply. There are vigilante assassins, cheating wives, men suffering from vainglory, cheating husbands all along with pugnacious prose and teary endings.<br />There's a sense of humor between the two men and the other characters. When Inspector Roberts is asked by Brandt how long it's been since he gave up smoking, Roberts says \\"five years, four weeks, two days and [looking at his watch] nine hours. More or less.\\"<br />There's no morality here.

Like the British historian-novelist David Howarth, David Robbins is able to take an enormous yet isolated incident and wrap it around three separate stories, a Spanish officer in the German Panzer Division trying to recapture his dignity after a near fatal shooting the year before, a young Russian woman trying to find her pilot lover shot down behind enemy lines, and a father and son on both sides of Russian Communism incarcerated in tight, hellish quarters in a Russian T-34 Tank during the Battle of Kursk in July of 1943.<br />All this unfolds in the largest tank battle ever culminating with the American invasion of Sicily on July 11, 1943.<br />You don't have to be a WWII buff to be thoroughly mesmerized by this book, but as in reading an Alan Furst novel, it helps. Professor Robbins deftly paints an accurate view of Hitler's last stand in Russia after the savage defeat of the Germans at Stalingrad, rolling the dice before the Americans enter the war in Europe, thereby turning his near impossible two front war into the resulting three front war.<br />Yet Robbins does this with beautiful writing. At one point he describes a train station where a passenger train lays in wait while tracks are replaced from a bombing 12 hours earlier: \\"It had no roof left, just scored beams, and it's sills were marred with brows of soot.\\" Later Katya, about whom one of the stories revolves, awakens before her night mission as some other aircraft take off. \\"Once they took off [she] listened to the silence return . . . serrated only by crickets and a mechanic hammering at something stubborn.\\"<br />While telling his stories the description of the battle takes on a more vivid meaning as the reader has humans to appreciate as Churchill wrote, 'their blood, sweat and tears.'<br />An excellent novel.

Some are important to the plot; some are insignificant. What's really irritating is that by page 100, several of these names are flung at you again and you wonder where you heard about them before? You have to literally start thumbing backward dozens of pages to &quot;oh yeah. Page 47. He was one of the onlookers to murder #1. errrr #2.&quot;<br />This is the old story of the successful, educated boys-now-men, banding together for decades, well into middle age, &quot;doing things for eachother. Here in Portland, Oregon it's to murder people who will (a) uncover them or (b) get in their way.<br />So, the identification of the moving parties is weak and then the plot is far fetched, bordering on unbelievable.<br />Mr. Margolin tells an interesting story and overall, it won't turn off his cadre of fans. However the best you can say is it's like pablum. Weak; milky.<br />Successful attorney Amanda Jaffe (who carries blackout, nauseous bucketfuls of grief and trauma from a previous case)  is asked to defend a rageful, educated, wealthy, frequently high, pimp. See. This is also a little difficult to imagine but nevertheless a connection is made and as Amanda seeks to unravel incongruities in the evidence pointing to Jon Dupre, she begins to envision the conspiratorial arm of the aforementioned conspirators, now grown into middla age and power.<br />It will entertain you.

I feel more comfortable with books. However, I reviewed Pierre Boulle's book last May and still see it as a Top 10 novel with great juxtapositioning of truly dicey moral issues.<br />But a couple of weeks ago, I was at my local library and someone was returning the &quot;The Bridge over the River Kwai&quot; DVD. I had seen the movie as a youngster and recalled that it deviated from the book to some extent, but nevertheless I wanted to see it again.<br />Well, barring the fact that it was made in 1957 and it had some of those odd exchanges of dialogue that marked scripts of 50 years ago, it was a magnificent movie.<br />Alec Guiness as Colonel Nicholsen was credible, understated, courageous, and faced with decisions alien to the world of a British Army Officer. All of which he played to Academy Award standards. Jack Hawkins as the head of Force 316, the demolitions group sent to blow up the bridge . . . 'bloody good idea, take a walk in the woods, lay some plastic explosive, and blow it up. Good show!' . . . . is excellent.<br />But the biggest surprise was William Holden, absolutely brilliant as the American Officer in a role written for him which did not exist in the book, a man who escapes from the prison camp and is then hospitalized in Med Cruise splendor, who is then asked to go back and assist Force 316 in the destruction of the bridge. Holden, clearly an excellent &quot;big&quot; actor in the 50's and the 60's, only wants to stay in the hospital where he is recuperating and drink fine scotch and play with the nurses (it's 1957 so it's all very up and up). How he is lured into the mission and to see his physical demeanor and style change is very well done.<br />Highly recommended. Larry Scantlebury. One time movie critic.	2003-11-14

Ask him!<br />When Jocelyn Gaines, also a Professor like her husband Walt, is killed on a archeological dig headed by her husband, the family unites for the tragic farewell. Briefly following that dad drifts of to lala land, figuratively and literally.<br />There's a lot of places here for confrontation and love and therapy and the like, but these adult, highly gifted men walk around saying lines that would get rejected in a &quot;Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure&quot; script.<br />Good story; painful but somewhat insightful look at families.

This is nearly a responsibility more than just a style. In fiction, certainly the tale can be told with a main character you wouldn't want go on vacation with. But generally, you should feel some passion about him/her and about the struggles they endeavor to resolve. Not so with Lieutenant Colonel Cromwell.<br />I have enjoyed many of the Jim Brady books. I thoroughly liked the wry humor and courage and depth and loyalty of Billy Port in &quot;Warning of War,&quot; and read the final 25 pages of &quot;The Marines of Autumn&quot; with a lump in my throat recognizing the pain and suffering of Tom Verity and his Marine translators during the breakout from Chosin Reservoir.<br />I couldn't replicate those feelings for Jim Cromwell. Here was a man about whom an epic could have been written. If there were novels about men at war that we wanted shorther, here was one we clearly wanted stretched. It had all the earmarks of an epic: New York to South Bend to Berlin to Camp Pendleton to Makin to Tarawa to Iwo, then to South Korea.<br />But instead, Colonel Cromwell is shallow, almost superficial. He has the feelings, he just can't express them. We're not expecting 'it was a dark and stormy night,' but in 20 years he has 3 contacts with women that last less than 2 pages, and his most insightful dialogue about the meaning of what Orwell's 'the hard men' do, is with Gunnery Sergeant Arzt, who, like Cromwell's eventual injuries, dies offstage somewhere with litle pomp nor circumstance.<br />Overall, it had great potential and I can't help but think it could have been longer and more substantial, instead of leaner and more sparse.<br />I'll still read Jim Brady; this one fell short of his own standards.	2003-11-02

Believing he was/is responsible for the rape and torture of his 15 year old daughter, he becomes an avenging angel, wreaking havoc, anonymous havoc of course, on those pedophiles he finds registered on the Net. Basically he declares war on them, seeking them out on business trips he takes for his law firm, and then executes them.<br />He finds support from those who circumstantially witness part of his efforts (returning a young girl to the ER he unexpectedly discovered; a police officer who feeds him to the Pittsburgh sex offender registration book; a pedophile's unsympathetic neighbor) we assume because they support his brand of vigilante justice.<br />The big question is whether he is a hero like the Charles Bronson character of the 70's \\"Death Wish,\\" or just another psychopath without the horrific sexual baggage.<br />I believe the novel could have been exponentially better had Tim Green given the reader a real moral decision to make, as is often presented in the novels of Alan Furst or earlier, by Pierre Boulle. Killing criminals loses it's appeal, in the broad sense of plot, along with the tenth grade and Steven Segal movies.<br />The first 1/2 of the book is well written although the descent into pulp comic book plot and sophmoric dialogue is rapid and all encompassing.	2003-11-02

It seems more often than not that the heroes of the mystery genre are white. So for many of us to go back into a racially subjugated time, here in the early sixties, we may realize that we never heard the other side of the story. We missed the other background. No longer with Walter Mosely.<br />Mr. Mosely brings us back to the past, the very recent past, where the black detective really had all the problems the white detective had, i.e. the bad guys would attempt to put him in harms way, plus the subjugation of the (for the most part) white police force.<br />So it would be a mistake for us to say that Mr. Mosely brings a &quot;refreshing&quot; view. Painful, perhaps. Unfortunate, certainly. But always very well written.<br />Here Ezekial Rawlins is asked by his friend, John, to help his girlfriend Alva's son stay out of the limelight or rather, the  searchlights of the police department. Brawly has been influenced by a Black Group named the First Men. Whether they truly seek only the leverage and subsequent parity that equal education can bring (the 1960's in Los Angeles was only a few years after Brown vs. Board of Education) or as the police believe, they were but a front for gun running, bank robbery  and revolution, is denied to us as it has been in the last 40 years.<br />However, Mosely doesn't pass judgment on this. Who's to say that in some arenas of social justice the end . . . But we're not asked to go there. We follow Easy, troubled by a violent past he cannot avoid, haunted by the sins of omission and commission, as the bodies turn up. Easy is a noble man who struggles, like Marlowe before him, Spenser and Cole, to maintain his own sense of integrity. Like some of the music of that time, &quot;(you) who are on the road, must have a code, that you can live by.&quot;<br />And Easy has that code, not always accepted by the people who love him or even by himself. But the code works and Mosely has another winner on his hands. John, the friend who first asked Easy Rawlins to help, says at the end that he is grateful for Easy's help in sorting out justice and greed, insult and victory, but all the while John wouldn't mind if he never saw Easy again. And it makes sense.<br />Outside of George Pelecanos, few tackle the task of racial injustice but more, the painful &quot;getting along&quot; in the novel genre as a background to murder and the mystery.

One of the deadpan lines delivered by the heroic Indiana Jones in one of the 1930-1940 successful series, reminds me of the question how bad could a book be that continues to punish the Evil empire?<br />Jack Higgins never lets us down. We always know what's coming. The quips between Hannah Bernstein and Sean Dillon; the wisdom and experience of Charles Ferguson; the accolades from the President and the Prime Minister. We've seen it all before and we love it!<br />It's hard to give it a 5 star rating because there's nothing new. Here we have Baron von Berger, having survived certain death in the bunker, presently living the good life as an industrialist with access to Hitler's billions. He eventually becomes involved with Kate Rashid, the sister of Mid Eastern oil barons (the Rashid Brothers) and von Berger's empire becomes exponentially larger.<br />His long lost son, Marco Rossi, returns to him and the two plot vengeance on General Fergusen and Sean, as a result of the latters' involvement in the killing of the Rashid brothers and possibly of the death of sister Kate.<br />Mr. Higgins writes an enjoyable story.

Larger than life. A summa cum laude John Wayne. Big. Funny. Occasionally (and regrettably less frequently now) introspective. Literate. Well read. Able to quote Chaucer and Yogi Berra in the same paragraph.<br />So Jesse Stone would fail in that comparison, albeit coming from the same pen as Parker but without the moral compass, the clarity of right and wrong, the comfort in the ying and the yang of his lover Silverman. Juxtaposed against that Jesse, close to promiscuous, haunted by his relationship with Jenn, his ex-wife, and a borderline drunk.<br />Here though, in \\"Stone Cold,\\" he begins the ascent from his own pit, his rut in the emotional trail.<br />He accepts the love of women. Molly, his faithful aide, loves him and yet tells him where the line in the sand is drawn. And he ponders that. And Marcy, (...), also shows him the line in the sand. And it is not inconsequential that one loves him and won't sleep with him and the other will, but won't love him. Darn good, Mr. Parker.<br />His treatment of the teenage rape victim is extraordinary. The manner in which he solicits women's thoughts and fears from Marcy, Molly, and the ever present, ever carnal Rita Fiore, is casebook stuff from more than just Parker's whimsy. And his treatment of Candace, the rape victim, seems to me to be the stuff of true love and compassion, even up to the point where when she leaves, he let's her and her family disappear, not willing to intrude on their self sought exile.<br />Dix his therapist, tells him that \\"there's a point where security and freedom begin to clash.\\" And that's the story of Jenn, his ex-wife, whom he clings to, even though repeatedly she breaks his heart.<br />Good stuff.

Murder's the name but the players are the game. Here Lescroart touches on an emotionally charged issue, euthanasia or mercy killing. There's a nice analogy with the game of baseball, perhaps unintentional, which is that in the early levels of the game the adolescent players learn 'the slaughter rule,' allowing a team which has no chance of winning having fallen behind an insurmountable lead, to exit with some self respect intact.<br />Hence we have Sal Russo, years ago a bright guy married to his sweetheart, knowing all along she is from a different life, years later preparing to die alone, the target of an agonizing tumor complicated by the onset of alzeimers. He is reunited by his oldest son, Graham, who tried his own (and his father's) dream of playing in the big game, only to fall short. Sal dies under mysterious circumstances with a DNR (do not revive) warning in plain view.<br />That Graham is arrested, then released, then indicted for murder, reflects the indecision the politicians, their constituents and the police have on this painful topic. Do the terminally ill have control over the time that they cross the river, or do we let events rob them of their remaining dignity?<br />Dismas Hardy is again the reluctant guardian at the gate, not wanting murder as a crime he defends, all the while knowing it's where his true strength . . . and definition lies.<br />If there is an irritant, it is the tedious relationship he has with his wife, Frannie. So many alter egos of the novelist's heroes love their partner for what they do, yet make life difficult for them because they do it. Kudos as an aside to Lucy Chenier, Elvis Pike's lover, who got up and left.<br />But with that one comment, a multi-latered book for the reader who wants social issues, murder most foul, great complicated characters and unexpected twists. Not a fast read but a very good job.	2003-10-19

Most of the mystery writers we frequently read, Elizabeth George, Crais, James Crumley, DeMille, feel free to discuss the petty irritations, resentments and sometimes out and out disregard for the people surrounding the main characters. Not so with the Griffen series (any Griffen series.)<br />Here is the criteria for all of the characters central to the plot, as I understand it to be. The heroes are surrounded by a group of 'special friends' of different races, Church habits, drinking habits, wives, and (oddly enough) ranks in the Department, Marine Corps or the Army. These 'friends' all get invited to the same mansions for elegant, servant-staff served parties, and reaffirm that they all see life the same way the hero does. There is order and then there is retribution.<br />Here's the key: intelligence, sexy wives or girlfriends ('she looked just as good walking away from me as she had walking to me'), a love of Scotch or other alcohol, loyalty for procedure, and an agonizing amount of simultaneous inner thoughts written in italics while someone else is speaking.<br />The Griffen books are the most sexist books in print while at the same time being unrealistic in what conversations people who work with eachother will tolerate in eachother. The closest friends are Black, Irish, 'wasp'ish, whatever that is now, Jewish, Middle Eastern, (ditto 'whatever that is now'), Italian, Episcopalean, Catholic and Methodist. All the wives know eachother and more remarkably, like eachother, drink heavily, and know (in this case) as much about police procedure as the husbands/boyfriends do. Everyone drinks an enormous amount of booze. And along the way they solve terrible crimes.<br />If you want a taste of how people really get along, I vote for George Pelecanos. He writes brilliantly of the anger, resentments, confusion and dislike we find for people in our every day walk through the nine to five. Read 'Shame the Devil' or 'Soul Circus.' That's real. This is not real.<br />I found more obscene language frivolously spoken in &quot;Final Justice&quot; than in the other Griffen novels. Additionally, Griffen, like any popular writer, has a cult-like following. I'm certainly one of the members, having read all of the series. So if you're going to radically alter the timeline of the series, like three decades, didn't Griffen think someone was going to notice? Didn't he want to offer up an explanation? Or did he just feel that his fans would read it anyhow and didn't deserve an explanation?<br />I guess we didn't.

Like a blue collar boxer from the east coast who tires in anonimity, taking the wrong fights for the right reason, you keep hoping he'll have a million dollar payday sometime.<br />Here, Elvis helps three children find their lost father on the run from the Russian Mob. It's a nice twist and Robert Crais, as always, pulls it off well.<br />But the children are tedious. One acts out and curses constantly. You're hoping that the mob gets him. The father is tedious. He complains from page five and we have him figured out by page fifteen. Joe is tedious. He lacks that hard, scary edge that never fails to interest us. Here he has one liners that are a cross between Clint Eastwood and Jack Benny. Heavily armed.<br />Not a page turner and a book that would be a poor place to start what is a very well written series.

There's hardly a Michael Connelly novel in which you don't think Harry's, errrrr, human. And here he is haunted again by the incompleteness of his past. The missing pieces. The concertos that never ended. The unfinished stories.<br />Retired, and not necessarily regretting it, he tugs at old cases like an itchy scab, especially one in which, like the Harry of old, he is haunted by something near spiritual, certainly otherworldly. Here it's the vic's hands, prayerfully petitioning him in the last seconds, the closing moments of her life.<br />So he ponders limited clues, arrogant Hollywood producers, even more arrogant cops, wounded heroes and scarred victims. Never alone with his brooding inner self, he recalls failures at relationships and the clout he never knew he had as a cop that he has now lost, apparently forever.<br />He still misses his ex-wife and creates excuses . . . all too human excuses . . . . to see her again. He even has one embarassing yet recognizable moment of 'checking up' on her.<br />And he seeks and finds redemption.

A musician, a make up artist, and (almost) a lawyer. Little by little we realize they are all feints,  illusions to distract us from what's really going on.<br />regrettably, the characters for the most part live the same lives of lost hopes, temporary terror, the progeny of dysfunctional childhood trauma, while Damon and Pythias loyalty, the courage of the 300 Spartans, and the wisdom of Yoda.<br />And along the way, Rhyme's love of Scotch Whiskey, his self-hatred of his paralysis, Sachs' loyalty above all to her father, Rhyme and her Camero, Lou Sellito's unsuccessful attempt to lose weight, and all the rest.<br />A couple of years ago Mr. Deaver wrote \\"The Blue Nowhere.\\" Incredibly well researched, different, and in that novel, we knew not what to expect or what the characters were going to say.

He is most successful at taking an international issue, the IRA from Belfast, national, domestic letter agencies warring with eachother, and telling a tale about them, around them and through them.<br />Often there is a love story about which to hang other issues, and Babylon is no exception.<br />The peace mission . . . by that I mean THE PEACE MISSION, is about to take off and two Concords are flying from Lod Airport in Israel to New York. And as in every disaster movie, the planes are filled with people who aren't who they seem to be or who they are telling other people they are. What's new?<br />Security has been lax in the fetal stages of the aircrafts' building, and bombs have been placed in the tail of both aircraft.<br />The tool by which DeMille gets us there, in this case Babylon, is nearly irrelevant. What he does is put dozens of different people together, hawks, doves, traitors, heroes, cowards, zealots, and then throws in an untested Palestinian force (the Ashbals) with their great numbers attacking the defending Israelis. Hmmmmm. I wonder if Nelson fell asleep while watching John Wayne's \\"The Alamo\\" on cable before he began this prodigious effort?<br />And of course the story is brought together by DeMille's capacity to describe everything from the aluminum mesh in the baggage compartment of the Concord to mascara. And to do so very well.<br />The other DeMille characteristic is dialogue. He has a gift of making his characters speak in a manner in which we can nod our heads and say, 'yeah, a guy in that fix would probably have said something like that.'<br />If there's a drawback to Babylon I believe it is that it doesn't go anywhere. Physically I mean. Other books literally move from point A to point B. Here we are stuck in the desert in a sand storm, kind of motionless, going nowhere. The other point is that DeMille usually has one wisecracking hero-noir who brings us together. Here, there really is no one for the reader to grab on to.

But murdering him isn't out of the question.<br />When things add up and then don't add up, the reader is hanging together with Lehane but not sure we know where he's taking us. That's an infrequent pleasure, a brilliant novelist getting us to the last 20 pages with NO idea of what's going to happen.<br />The ending will knock your socks off.	2003-08-29

Certainly The Long Goodbye is one of the top ten mysteries written, maybe even the top three. It has that tremendous yet subtle notion of pathos, loyalty, the purity of truth, (perhaps uniqely American) 'stick-to-it-iveness' or relentlessness, and a gritty, scarred, hero.<br />And certainly Marlowe is the father of a whole bunch of bastard children. Spenser, the oldest, his brother Dave Robicheaux, the darker cousins Lucas (Davenport) and no, not Elvis but Joe Pike.<br />Juxtapose that against the beauty and insight of Chandler's writing, his voice resonating with the truth about, say relationships. He writes about the war-hero, shattered after the trauma of death, through the words of his wife: \\"I love my husband. Not as a young girl. That's passed. That man I loved then died in the war. But I love him.\\"<br />The names and notions intertwine. Marlowe's loyalty to Terry Lennox is the stuff of The Knights of the Realm. The women are tough and knowledgeable. The time is past. Or is it?<br />Top shelf writing from a man who wrote little but said a lot.	2003-08-19

That may not be true when you consider the Vietnam War, a backdrop for many DeMille characters either directly or indirectly.<br />This is my favorite DeMille novel. In many respects it may be the one in which he comes the closest to accurately describing the truth of the pain and haunting memories that all of us who served there or who had brothers, sons or daughters who served there, feel. Relentlessly. Over and over again.<br />Ben Tyson has come back from his tour \\"across the pond\\" whole. At least visibly. Married. Corporately knighted. Great wife. Great sex. Great house in the 'burbs. All that smell of blood and death locked up in a padlocked footlocker somewhere in the basement.<br />But as it turns out, now, years later, a book is about to be released about an event he participated in almost a score of years earlier.<br />We all recall My Lai and Lt. Calley and Captain Medina. This is like that, although geographically venued at a French hospital  \\"60 clicks north of Danang and 30 clicks south of Quang Tri\\" in Hue. (Those are my quotes not DeMille's. I know where Hue is. I spent a year there.)<br />DeMille brings us along slowly, drawing from vast personal experience. Tyson gets called back in to stand trial. Clearly the military wants to distance themselves from the war, savage Tyson, and go back to making those \\"Army of One\\" commercials. (This is only 10-12 years after the the war and life was still unpleasant for the professional military person.)<br />Tension; Tyson's life upturned; marital strife; a wife that wants out who 'didn't sign on for this;' a Military Court Martial; his guilt . . . all of our guilt.<br />Great story. The resolution is rewarding but it is the journey that teaches all of us, them that did and them that didn't, how we all lost innocence never to be found again.<br />You might want to read DeMille's \\"Up Country,\\" written 15 years later, about returning to Vietnam. It's a long journey. The reader has a chance to embrace great writing and learn a lot as well.writing and learn a lot as well.	2003-08-17

Introducing a few of Shakespeare's tragedies, he would joke that all the characters the venerable bard didn't know what to do with by the end of the 4th Act, he would bring together in the 5th Act and bump them off. Hamlet, Lear, Macbeth, and all the rest of them. Even poor Romeo and Julie. There's an element of that in the Stephen Coonts novels.<br />Liberty is great. Coonts takes aim at the blustery agencies and they in turn become 'the foolish player[s] who strut and fret their hour upon the stage.' And of course, the xenophobic terorists suffer the same fate at his pen.<br />The Russians, ever the evil empire, now have their own hero in Janos Ilin, who delivers the horrifying news to the almost John Wayne-like Jake Grafton that there are 4 nukes heading for the US. He exacts a favor from the ever level headed Admiral Grafton, and we are uncertain of it until the last 10 pages. Nice work, Steve, keeping those face cards close to the vest.<br />There are dozens of characters, good and bad, who populate the first 60 or 80 pages. There are so many characters that several hundred pages later, you have to go back to determine 'who was that guy?' There are assassins, bad guys turned good guys (see Zelda, computer criminal turned Joan d'Arc) and bad guys turned REALLY good guys (see Tommy Carmellini, again, a new hero of tremendous substance.)<br />The killings are somewat grisly so if that churns your stomach, beware. Heroes abound; love is good; fools are plentiful; and the bad guys suffer righteously ... in the 5th Act.<br />Stephen Coonts does a great job of bringing the reader up to date with his plot and characters, always well crafted and intricate. In the beginning there are almost too many but it all evens out.<br />Much more complicated than a beach read it remains overwhelmingly an excellent action novel.	2003-08-17

Or Hart to believe.<br />So in this case the John Katzenbach story of a UCMJ Military trial for murder in a German prison camp suffers, not so much from the writing, which is excellent, but rather from the movie, which wasn't.<br />This is a psychological thriller painted on the canvas of the atrocities in a NAZI prison camp. Tommy Hart, recently of a law school venue, finds himself defending a Black Pilot for murder.<br />The unrestrained sense of racism of the troops against First Lieutenant Lincoln Scott, ironically set in the heart of the Aryan nation, WWII Germany, is a tragic point and counterpoint.<br />In many respects it is an action courtroom thriller. But Katzenbach's success is that he shows the reader it isn't. It's more than that.<br />This is a great read for anyone interested in WWII. Like some of James Brady's novels of the Korean War, it weaves facts with the storyline rather seamlessly.<br />A good read. Certainly recommended.	2003-08-17

I guess it's kind of that John Wayne feeling, you like to have a big guy around who can always be relied upon to take care of business. Here, he almost fails, and that's the magnetism of Small Vices.<br />Spenser is hired by the now successful, leggy Rita Fiore. There is the usual overt flirting &quot;. . . too bad you didn't . . .&quot; and &quot;Boy, if you only had  . . .&quot; and &quot;you had your chance . . &quot; that we've come to chuckle at and with the honorable sleuth.<br />Here he's asked to track down 'the real murderer' which will free a man wrongfully doing life in the hard place.<br />It's hard to pity the imprisoned man Spenser is asked to free. It seems most feel he doesn't really deserve to be freed . . . even the loyal friend Hawk feels that Alves belongs in jail, &quot;either for this crime or one he got away with.&quot;<br />But Spenser, who again tells someone his first name but not us, gets too close and takes three slugs to the shoulder, leg and chest.<br />It takes Susan, Hawk, Quirk, Belson, Lee Farrel and Vinnie nearly a year to rehab Spenser, who loses 40 pounds in the process, has a hard time making his limbs do what he wants them to, and basically can't walk. But they do and honor and heroism prevail, villains are suitably thrashed, and Susan and Spenser hook up. Again. And again.<br />There's a lot of vulnerability in Spenser this time. Like Joe Pike in The Last Detective, his body has betrayed him and he is lost. Sadness, even tears. The pages describing Spenser trying to get up the hill in Santa Barbara after again learning how to walk again are riveting. Good stuff.<br />If I had a disappointment, it was Spenser's laissez faire attitude towards Hawk who took a year off to mentor/train/help him. But maybe that's part of the mystique, he knew how he felt and so did Hawk.<br />Great stuff. Rachel Wallace is still #1 for me but Small Vices is a close second.	2003-08-07

You must read Pelecanos. Stuck, sentenced, incarcerated or living there by choice, Derek Strange, black, muscular, aging gracefull, wise, and Terry Quinn, younger, white, more hot blooded, less introspective, prowl the streets of Washington and Maryland righting toppled lives where they can and seeking retribution when possible. They fail at the former from time to time but rarely at the latter.<br />When Derek signs on to help the Defense team for a self admitted Black crime king, Quinn goes along, admittedly with some reluctance. But Derek explains that he feels he must do something to stand up against the government from snuffing out the lives of black men when it chooses to. He defends, he tells Quinn, not Granville Oliver the mobster but Granville Oliver the Black Man whom the Feds have targeted for execution.<br />It's a tricky bit of writing but Pelecanos pulls it off. Franklin wrote about the signatories of the Declaration of Independance, \\"We had better hang together or we will certainly hang separately.\\"<br />And that is the sum total of Pelecanos' mysteries. They're good; they're harsh; they're even disturbing. But all along there is that call to 'hanging together.' We have to get along. Some are offended by Pelecanos' tendency to preach. But I don't see it that way. He just uses the forum of writing excellent mysteries to point out a few painful truths. Coughlin and Burke do the same thing regarding alcohol. Parker does it with relationships.<br />Quinn and Strange find enough evidence to support the Defense's strategy to reduce the Oliver sentencing from the injection to life. You'll have to read the book to discover if it works or not.<br />Along the way they find a few lives of children they can save and lose a few others. Great stuff.<br />If I have a gripe, it could be too much rock 'n roll memorablia. Too many 'muscle' cars from the '70's. Too much about sports.<br />Of course, that's what I like so maybe it is a good addition. 5 stars. Could be 6.ves of children they can save and lose a few others.

It is a novel but Jim Brady's own demons pop up relentlessly and the reader does himself a great service if he or she first reads &quot;The Coldest war,&quot; Brady's autobiographical recollection of his life as a Marine Rifle Platoon Commander.<br />William Manchester writes of his youth while staring through a glass of (I think) bourbon, on a flight west to recall &quot;the young man he had been,&quot; (ironically as I now recall also as a Marine.)Writing of the war a half dozen years later, Brady does the same with brief, terse, vivid, sparingly used prose.<br />Tom Verity, called back into service in the Marine Corps after serving as a Rifle Platoon Commander in the Pacific, reluctantly leaves the girl he loves at home. But this time it's a different love story because the girl is his three year old daughter, Kate, an orphan if Verity dies.<br />There's a lot of Harry Brubaker, the Navy Panther Jet pilot estranged from his wife and daughters in a similar situation in Michner's classic about Korea, &quot;The Bridges at To Ko Ri.&quot;<br />Verity, a Chinese linguist sent over just for the &quot;walk in the Park,&quot; finds himself at the Chosin Reservoir surrounded by 120,000 Chinese infantry soldiers. This is where Colonel Lewis &quot;Chesty&quot; Puller, commanding the Marines, supposedly remarked when being told he was surrounded by 10 Chinese infantry divisions, &quot;now we got the B******* where we want 'em.&quot; I don't know if it's true. Made great legend though.<br />We owe it to these men and women caught up in the ego of Commanding Generals and comfortable politicians to read as much about Korea.

Mr. Feinstein does an excellent job in discussing why (not how) this is such an intricate, wonderful, insane game. His introduction to Davis Love, now re-christened by TV wunderkind as DL3, was excellent. Feinstein's opening with the Ryder Cup battle(s) and Love playing his first Ryder Cup Match reminded me of the Bob Seger line, &quot; . . . and my hand was shaking.&quot;<br />The only caveat I would add is twofold: An executive non-sports oriented Oklahoman might be fascinated by life on a pro football team and be magnetized by the Philadelphia Eagles' tale in &quot;Bringing the Heat.&quot; Or a student-athlete cross country star who trains alone, mile after mile at a small high school in Decatur, Georgia, might finally figure out what the obsession is with High School Footbal by reading &quot;Friday Night Lights.&quot;<br />But you have to know a little bit about golf, love it, be addicted to it, hate it, be mystified by it, have an elementary school understanding of it to really enjoy Mr. Feinstein's observations.<br />And the second problem is that this is all pre-Tiger stuff. And unless you've been living in a cave for the last decade + and your subscription to Sports Illustrated ended because they couldn't find your zip code, the golf world changed A.T., after Tiger. 4 Stars; good read.	2003-07-20

Jeffery Deaver is authoring some of the best mystery novels to date. His 'Lincoln Rhyme' series is excellent, and it subtley puts to sleep (or at least out of the way) some of the frequently preconcieved notions even the best of us have about stereotyping people and pigeonholing their issues.<br />Lincoln Rhyme is of course the brilliant forensic scientist who suffered a spine severing accident rendering him a quad. Others would have given up at that point but Mr. Deaver has us  recognizing  that 'giving up' was not in Mr. Rhyme's character.<br />His association with Amelia Sachs is to some extent a happy alternative to the Susan of Spenser fame and the Lucy of Elvis Cole fame. A tough, single minded woman she is equally afraid of failure as she is driven to success. Which leads me to why I am tiring of the relationship.<br />It doesn't go anywhere. The story moves at breakneck speed. This paperback was 500+ pages and it only chronologically covers 48 hours. While the novels are great, the dialogue crisp and both literate as well as \\"New York-ese,\\" and the plots filled with Hichcockian surprises, the relationship is tedious. Why does she have to drive at 101 miles an hour on the Long Island Expressway, have crying jags and do nothing about her arthritis in her leg (Advil, Sachs, the key to anti-inflamatories.)<br />Having said that, this mystery picks up at the end of a long investigation, the smuggling of Chinese immigrants into New York. Once trapped by Rhyme's investigative skills which are both brilliant and resounding in common sense, \\"The Ghost,\\" a Chinese 'snakehead,' blows up the ship and murders a number of the \\"undocumented\\" passengers he was smuggling.<br />Clues abound. Who is he? Why did he kill the passengers? What more daredevil things can Amelia do as Lincoln's legs? Will the Ghost get to the surviving families?<br />Mr. Deaver drops clues to us throughout the book and we are well informed with the sprinkling of evidence that we learn along with the less able investigators from INS, FBI, State and NYPD.<br />The relationship between Sachs and Rhyme keeps intruding. Some readers may like this. I don't know. I want to read a book about a crime, murder, mayhem, kidnapping, evil genius perps pursued relentlessly by homeric investigators. \\"Relationships\\" are in a different section of Borders or Waldenbooks or Amazon.<br />Anyhow, that's my gripe.

This book should be required reading in high schools and in colleges where there is but a hint of racism, sexism, homophobia or any other of the \\"isms\\" that ignore the stark brutality of what we can do to persons all around us. Dr. King wrote, \\"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\\"<br />The Pianist reminds us of that.<br />No, we ourselves were not responsible for the extermination camps and the unbelievable brutality generated against members of a race. And yet this happened in our century in the time of our fathers and grandfathers. What were they thinking? What was the world thnking?<br />This is the darkest time of recent history. This is the darkest time in the last 1000 years. Nothing compares with it.<br />Szpilman was no passing fad. He was one of the most relished and sought after conert pianists in his time. That he avoided execution by the Nazi's is the result not so much of survival skills or random chance, both playing a significant role, but possibly because he was destined to tell the story.<br />The movie is brilliant but it should not offset the need to read the book, more powerful, more horrific, more meaningful. Szpilman and his survival is truly a juxtapositioning  of \\"beauty and the beast,\\" the true beast. Highly recommended.	2003-07-10

Greg Iles is a very gifted writer and I think it was for that reason I stayed with him for a looooong allegro before the entire orchestra kicked in. And then I felt the hackles on the back of my neck stand up.<br />Most of us, I guess we're either lucky or stupid, have loved \\"the wrong person\\" or been loved by \\"the wrong person.\\" So comes John Waters, repeatedly drawn into a painful past by the magnetic memories of the lovely but imbalanced Mallory Candler, his imaginative, enthusiastic, however insanely possessive lover of his college years.<br />Years earlier, Mallory dies a violent death, raped and murdered by a passerby. But currently, things are unsettled in Waters' life. His wife won't have relations with him, herself rudderless after two heartbreaking miscarriages. His best friend and partner seems to be stealing from him. His little girl is in a grade school where a pedophile has just been arrested. And strangely enough, after years of fidelity and near celibacy, John is attracted to Eve Sumner, a somewhat loose realtor.<br />And then, just as you're starting to get bored by the tortured introspection that frankly keeps this book from a five and makes it a four, Mallory, certainly dead for years, starts speaking through the throat of Eve Sumner.<br />Caught me dozing. Mr. Iles hung that third strike right past me and caught me looking. Very exciting after that. He really keeps you guessing. Not his best stuff but the last 1/2 is brilliant. The three way conversations are masterfully done. Recommended.	2003-07-08

There are some things in life that are fairly unpleasant. Some of our sarcastic colleagues say &quot;this is reality&quot; or another scripted (right from television) response, &quot;deal with it.&quot; And in dealing with the unavoidable, this is for the most part true. Somethings are just darn unpleasant, sad, and tearful. They are in our family or our neighborhood and we can't ignore them. They are, in fact, part of life.<br />Now reading is a special joy, at least for me. I read for three reasons. One, the beauty of the word. Everything from James Dickey to Tennyson to The Sonnets to The Book of Common Prayer. The words are melodious, strung together to create an almost  palpable feeling of comfort and enjoyment.<br />Secondly, I read to learn. Harry Truman. Omar Bradley. Phil Sheridan. George Custer. The Battle of Roark's Drift. The 300 Spartans. Things I never learned in school that interest me now.<br />And finally, I read for pleasure. Elizabeth George. Robert Crais. Parker. Lehane. Burke.

I'm pretty certain of that. Even when we know the guy's going to end up being 80 years old, still checking out the babes, beating up the bad guys, with an emotional United Nations of friends and camp followers, even then we'll always enjoy his company for a few hundred pages.<br />Here he hooks up with an old flame, Rita Fiore, tries to help her client, the incredibly dumb Mary Smith, hangs with Cimoli, Quirk, Belson, Vinnie and Hawk, has his ashes hauled as usual by the ever size 5 Susan, and in the end, well, you know.<br />One disappointment for me was that he doesn't seem as sad as he used to be once faced with the darker side of the whims of life. As  a consequence, Susan's sadness at the suicide of one of her patient's seems almost trite, certainly unnecessary. But it's Spenser being Spenser.<br />Hard to beat the early Spensers, but the recent ones ain't too shabby either. This one, &quot;Widow's Walk,&quot; is one of the better novels of Parker's cast in the last ten years. Nevertheless,  if you're new to the quintessential PI you shouild start with the early ones. These are some of the best mysteries in the last 50 years. Like the game we would play when we were kids, if you were going to take 10 mysteries with you on a deserted island, three would be by Parker written before 1985, possibly Gudwulf, Rachel Wallace, Ceremony, God Save the Child or A Savage Place.<br />But as Watson would tell Holmes, I digress. Spenser fans won't be disappinted in Widow's Walk.	2003-06-06

The point of all of the folks getting together in the lawfirm of his deceased buddy's employer, the evil senior partner, the hot trophy chick-wife, the tired but savage ex-wife, the wise-cracking partner, is the division of the \\"key man\\" policy of insurance, a cool 2 mil.<br />Savage ex-wife will lose it all to her lawyer to prevent the blond size 5 from getting a cent. And the blond, blue-eyed 'whatEVER' current wife feels the same. Tension. Witty arguments. Insurance executives who laugh too hard. Points and Authotities on 'accidental death.'<br />So it's a small thing and probably to Steve Marrini fans, of which I am one, it will make me appear petty. But you see, so much is made of this \\"key man\\" insurance policy that you wonder if someone didn't tell Mr. Martini . . . wives, ex, future, current, sizes 5 to 25, these folks don't get key man insurance benefits. They are not the beneficiary. Or husbands for that matter. Or beautiful, obedient children.<br />It's for the company who has a really important Doctor or Lawyer or Salesperson or Broker and will suffer if that man or woman becomes unexpectedly (aren't they all?) deceased.<br />See. It's not for the wives of Nick Rush, gunned down by accident on a San Diego street corner in a hail of automatic rifle fire. It's for his employer for whom he, the deceased Nick Rush, was a \\"key man.\\"<br />So this is kind of irritating. And so much swings on this. And subsequently it seems like a lot of effort wasn't put into the groundwork.<br />And for me, again liking Mr. Martini, it went downhill from there. Paul Madriani lacks the history of wisecracking of Elvis Cole or Spenser so instead he comes up scripted and shallow. And as a character he lacks the painful introspection of John Connolly's characters or James Burke's Dave Robicheaux.<br />So overall, a disappointment. I'll read him again. But this story was a let down.	2003-06-06

Pierre Boulle equates the ritual of the Japanese with the ritual of the British. Lots of room for disagreement here. Few people would disagree with the more American view that being a captive of the Japanese in WWII could well be a sentence of death. But of course, Boulle is French so that explains some of his xenophobia regarding either country.<br />The fact is, the moral issues are carefully presented. The soothsayer, Major Clipton, goes back and forth with the concept that imprisoned men with nothing to do often die of despair.<br />The time is 1942 in a Japanese prison camp. Conditions are atrocious. The Japanese are building a train route between Burma into points north. The route will carry men and machines to further the Imperial Japanese aims. It is early in WWII and the Americans (there are none in the book) and the British have pretty much been spanked by the advancing Japanese. Read retreat. Reat surrender. Read a long time in a jungle prison camp. Read dysentery, diphtheria and malaria.<br />So Colonel Nicholson's, he's the British ranking officer,isn't stupid. He knows that without some form of discipline many of his men will give up. The evil alcoholic prison warden, Colonel Saito, is his counterpart.<br />With concessions, Nicholson agrees to build the bridge crossing the 600 foot wide Kwai River. But should he do an acceptable job? An above average job? Or should he do the best possible job imaginable, a credit to the British Army, lasting into and beyond the next century?<br />Major Shears and his demolition team from Force 316 rendezvous in Siam (that's how old the book is) to blow up the bridge. And all three forces meet, Nicholson, Saito and Shears.<br />Certainly up there in the top ten books about the war. Read in conjuction with Katzanbach's \\"Hart's War\\" (For God's sake, skip THAT movie)or Jmaes Clavell's \\"King Rat,\\" all about the morality of prisoners of war.<br />5 stars.

Almost a John LeCarre sense of evil in the government (well, ok, the military) that Alex (again) has to penetrate. He and his huge boyhood friend try to help Sergeant Cooper, positively (and we know this from the first few pages) framed for murders he didn't commit. And like the New York Sanitation sign from the 70's that read \\"dig we must,\\" they keep pushing until they find massive coverups from Vietnam.<br />This is intriguing because if the cover-ups happened in the late '60's, let's see, add the three's and seven's, carry the nine's, hmmmmm, some of the senior field grade officers then would be, ahhh, 80? Late 70's?<br />Personally, I am uncomfortable with the analogy that the tragic foolishness that was Vietnam now reaches a new level of concern under the pen or laptop of James Patterson:  That these men need to be hunted down like Nazi War Criminals. But no matter, Cross and Sampon are up to the task.<br />So there's a lot of murder, high tech toys, reminiscings about the lost innocence of youth, as well as a lot of love (both the vertical kind and the horizontal kind), a marriage, a couple of illegal State sanctioned executions (imagine the wrongful death suits coming out of those!) and the typical mingling of family values and yet painful retribution for the evil doers.<br />A little confusing. A fast read. If you like a superficial novel, good James Patterson. If this is what you want and expect, he delivers.	2003-05-13

"	At one end of the mystery noir spectrum you have Michael Connelly and Robert Crais, and at the other end you have Stephen Cannell. And the difference is . . . television.<br />Or, as Tony Filosiani, the ex-NYPD top cop picked up by the founding fathers to lead LA out of its incredible slump might say, 'You ain't gonna find Tolstoy in the rack at the drugstore. Ba-Da-Bing, Ba-Da-Bang.' Truer words and all that.<br />It begins with an old Alfred Hitchcock premise, doomed rebellious (read 'still believing') police officer sees best friend but dead best friend in a random LA traffic snarl. And he must do what doomed rebellious police officers must do. Dig. Scratch. Keep looking.<br />All of Shane Scully's friends, and by the telling of this story they are are few in number, tell him to stop. But Shane can't. And I think we're suppose to feel that this time, Shane will lose what few remaining chances he has to become, well, happy. But Shane can't.<br />He seeks to restore his best friend's death to comprehensible logic (always a herculean task in television) and this leads to dishonest cops, the always present \\"other\\" informant on the inside, the Columbian cartel, drugs, silly Amazon women, and all the usual suspects.<br />It's television. Visceral. Visual. Unfulfilling but pleasant in a superficial manner. If I had a feeling of distate, it was not over the repetitive torture or sex scenes, it was with Cannell's flirtation with racial and gender profiling. By now I find tedious that all Italians are overweight and talk like extras in Goodfellows, all African American men have rippling muscles, women are always calmed down by life altering sex (unless they're bad women and then they are evil and satanic), and that all South Americans have beady, black eyes. As Tony  would say, 'wazupwitdat?' I like Cannell. But he reminds me of why I stopped watching television.<br />Nevertheless, billions of people watched The Wiseguy, Mannix, The Rockford Files and Starsky. If you go to a poorer country you'll still see those big chested (both genders) heroes and heroines wrestling with the baddest of the bad. In 60 minutes with commercials.<br />So the key here is, again in the words of the soothsayer who brings it all together, Tony Filosiani, 'whatjawannaread?'<br />Cannell tells a good story but it's very superficial. When you read Connelly and Crais, you get a feel for what characters might or even would say. There's nothing like that in The Viking Funeral. It is a great pool read or airplane read. You don't have to work much. But it's like TV.

It is beautifully written with descriptions heretofore the province of James Lee Burke or James Dickey. John Connolly, a new read for me, has a style that's almost musical. His writing occasionally transcends the dimension of the word. The above mentioned Burke (through his character Dave Robiceaux)writes of his prayers for the dead, 'that God is not limited by time or space' so he hopes that God will alleviate some of their suffering. And Connolly visits the killing field of a young girl and prays over the site of her 'murder most foul,' telling her that he may not know her and had he, he quite possibly wouldn't have liked her. But he promises her justice and retribution.<br />If you recollect some of the scary novels of Steven King when he was in his prime like \\"The Shining\\" or \\"The Stand,\\" and you combine that with some of the intricacy of Dennis Lehane along with the prose of Burke, you're getting close to what John Connolly is all about.<br />My personal feelings are that there might be too much time spent on the near mystical qualities of certain characters or events. If an author wants to give us some historical data about the characters or plot but of course he or she's writing a novel so they can't use a footnote, an occasional italicized paragraph is not distracting. Mr. Connolly sometimes goes on and on for pages. Too much for me but that's personal taste and doesn't distract one from an excellent read.<br />Charlie Parker, the emotionally beaten ex-NYPD cop, leaves his home in Maine to help a friend in the South. He runs into one twist after another involving Klan racism and murder, unresolved issues of class struggle and the nazi-like right wing movement. This may all be the same bugaboo but Connolly delineates it well.<br />Parker is helped by his girlfriend whom readers will discover is neither squeamish nor shy but a woman of action. You'll forget Susan in the Spenser series or virtually all of the other femme de guerre.<br />And likewise he's helped by the odd couple, kind of a \\"the right thing at any price\\" with a touch of psychosis, Louis and Angel. They're not Felix and Oscar.<br />Which leads me to my second criticism. This really is a book for which the reader should have some background. So don't be like me and ignore other reviews. At least read \\"The Killing Kind\\" first, the previous book (but Connolly has only written three earlier books so read them all!) \\"The Killing Kind\\" will introduce you to some of the characters and you will better comprehend certain references that my first time through left me in the dark.<br />It's always enjoyable to find a new author.

I had a real high stress job in the '80's and the late '80's and I decided to go back to one of my first loves, reading. I hadn't read a novel in years and I was literally, killing myself. So I picked up Joe Weber's \\"Rules of Engagement.\\" My recollection of it was that it was a little superficial but good plotting. Trouble was, I hadn't read a book in 10 years. So by that standard it was \\"War and Peace\\" meets \\"Tale of Two Cities\\" with \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\" thrown in.<br />Since that time I have probably read 50 books a year but I've always had a soft spot in my heart for Joe Weber.<br />Well Joe, we're even. I don't know where you were going with \\"Dancing with the Dragon,\\" but you didn't get there.<br />PLOT:  Confusing. I lost track of what ocean I was in, what frigate I was chasing, who was flying what and what type of aircraft was being flown.  C<br />INFERENCE:  I was uncomfortable with the racism, but more importantly, I was uncomfortable with the assumption that all Chinese were evil or drunk or drunk and evil, politicians are fat, and that there are two ex-military pilots that are on a first name basis with the Secretary of Defense, State, NSC and the President.  C-<br />DIALOGUE:  I think that the characters should be allowed to report what has happened and what they are going to do about it, once in awhile for the reader's benefit. This is a good way to keep the characters, the reader and the writer figuratively and literally on the same page.<br />But every page we have these silly conversations between Scott and \\"whatever she is to him\\" on why this happened, what could have happened, why what could have happened didn't happen and what they're going to do about it.\\" This is really exceptionally tedious.  D<br />CHARACTERS:  Come on. I kind of like Spenser and Susan where they go into the bedroom and the next scene we see is that  pathetic dog sleeping on the bed with them and Susan is sighing and Spenser is trying to reach over to the bedstand to turn on the Red Sox game. 'Nuff said. We're all adults. We don't need a schematic.<br />But Scott and Jackie? Do they like eachother? Do they kiss? Do they sleep together? How about a really hot tango? Something.

Let me start off by saying I like Stephen Cannell. There's a certain type of writing he excels at. It's action packed, not hard to figure out. Good guys prevail, bad guys get the stuffing kicked out of them.<br />It's also predictable, superficial, anticipated and expected. It is, for the most part, like TV. It is in fact, TV.<br />It's difficult to feel nervous about Shane. We know at the end of the day he's going to have an Amstel Light, hug his son, and have life changing sex with his model-like wife. How bad can it get?<br />The problem with TV is of course, it's there to sell the sponsor and is never, never very believable. Ergo, the take-off on the reality shows. Who gives a hoot about greedy people with tattoos and abs, except that for the first time since the 70's, we're not really certain how it's going to end.<br />Not so with Shane, Chooch and Alexa. We know what's going to happen. Shane overhears one of his wife's friend's boyfriend say that he murdered his two ex-wives. Now that's a plausible beginning to a novel. So he follows up on that. And gets hooked up with the New Jersey mob. And Chooch's girlfriend gets kidnapped, and Shane starts a movie company.<br />Actually, it's a fun kind of story. And it has it's place. It won't be quoted like Dickens or mistaken for Leo Tolstoy.<br />But see, that's why we stopped watching TV and turned to reading, and that's why we implore our children to stop watching television. Because it's shallow, superficial and unchallenging.<br />So I can't disregard Stephen Cannell. In fact I like him and I will continue to read him. But he's not going to have me sweat like The Guards did, or Lehane does, or Elmore Leonard or James Lee Burke.<br />But boychik, don't be a goniff. Love 'ya. Loved your work. Keep it up babe.

So with a totally unexpected result, he takes over the Foreman child rearing duties and becomes a \\"Mr.Mom\\" with an attitude.<br />The biggest problem he has is his wife, also a gifted software designer, who has recently become inattentive, ornery, flash fire tempered and guilty of unexplained absences. He begins to think that her research in artificial intelligence (AI) and as the moving force behind a 'next stage' of nanoparticles that can think themselves into an airborne camera for government snooping may be, well, more than meets the eye.<br />Jack gets a chance to consult with his wife's new company and arrives to see that the nanoparticles his wife has assembled, smaller than a human cell, truly have a mind of their own. Further, that they are regenerating at an alarming rate, that they are \\"learning\\" from the errors of prior generations, that they have escaped out of the company facility onto the Nevada countryside, and that they are beginning to kill animals of increasing size.<br />Too miniscule for the naked eye, able to slip through the cells of the human body, en masse they are able to 'chameleon' themselves into taking human form. Once in the facility, Jack realizes that the nanoparticles are now trying to get back into the facility with the intention of wiping the inhabitants out.<br />Kind of a mixture of \\"Jurassic Park\\" and \\"Andromeda Strain,\\" with a touch of Stephen King's \\"Cujo.\\" Not terribly in depth development of the characters, a constant criticism of a lot of Crichton's heroes and anti-heroes, yet offset by good scare tactics and an above average storyline.<br />Readers who long for the old Crichton and earlier stories won't be disappointed.	2003-04-01

One of the reviewers entitled the review with 'strap yourself in,' and I literally did that, on a flight from the midwest to London with time to spare.<br />Elvis Cole, not as committed to solitude as the enigmatic, self exiled Joe Pike, struggles in his relationship with the attractive lawyer Lucy Chenier.

It's 2:30 in the morning and I couldn't put it down. That's the best compliment you can give an author.<br />Jack Taylor is often drunk. He hangs around drinkers and flirts with the insanity that constant drunkenness and binge drinking create. All of his relationships have been gunned down in the crossfire of alcohol. His friend Sutton is a vicious man that  on rare occasions of sobriety, Jack rationalizes and explains to himself. He is kind to winos as in the ancient Padraig. He says 'I drink with'em; then buy them a foolish wreath when they die.' His closest friend is Sean, a bar owner. All of this takes place in Galway, Ireland, where Jack Taylor has disgraced himself and been cashiered out of the Siochna Guards, nearly impossible to do, and lost everything along the way.<br />A lovely woman, Ann, asks Jack to disprove the notion, public and private, that her teenage daughter committed suicide, and thereby proving that she was murdered. Jack begins to suspect that she stepped in front of harm's way from a part-time job she had at a business owned by shady characters.<br />There's a lot of James Crumley's \\"The Wrong Case\\" in The Guards.

Does he share it with his little brother, coming to grips with the fact that while he is successful in appearance, they are both lonely middle-aged men? Will he and his brother, dysfunctional from birth by the same forces yet traveling in different directions, ever unite? Will Ray piece his life together with the fine Kaylie or the even finer ex-wife, Vicki? Will Ray ever get his FAA instrument rating?<br />We know none of these things and we will never know any of these things because Mr. Grisham repeatedly takes us back and forth across rural America, again, and again. And again. The book ends, gratefully, and we come to the same concluusion we came to around the thirtieth page.<br />So, wipe the road dust from your car, take it to the car wash, stretch the kinks out from many 15 hour one-way trips, and be grateful you bought this book in paperback or got it from the library.	2003-02-24

And I think you have to have a lot of patience to read it. I got to page 115 and the latter overcame the former.<br />In reading Dumas, Seinkewicz, LeCarre, Furst, Hemingway, even Chandler, one is bound to get a flavor of the time. You might get that in author's description of the architecture. Or perhaps in the transportation. Those gifted authors, especially those writing from a later time describing a much earlier one can amplify the scene with dialogue. Conversations between the characters. How people spoke. Somehow we can rest assured when D'Artagnan is invested into the Musketeers, he doesn't say, &quot;Dude. Thanks.&quot;<br />But there's a limit to how much 'flavoring' we can take. If we truly don't understand what the characters are saying, then we lose the impact, sense, feeling and meaning of an entire scene.<br />I struggled with Mr. Lawton's dialogue and I certainly applaud those readers who understood what he was saying.<br />However, 'boffins,' 'wobbling,' 'saggar-maker bottom knocker,' 'are you going to have her put to tup this month?' 'for a moment he thought they'd both corpse,' and 'morris dancing in middle wallop,' all before page 11 . . .<br />well reading with a glossery in my left hand while turning pages with my right, was something I ceased doing in the 10th grade. It sounds like a heckuva' story, though. If you can get through that I'm certain you'll be fine.<br />Bloody silly of me. I just fagged out. Cheers.	2003-02-23

And visions. If Elvis Cole is funny and irreverant, Dave is sad and wry. If Patrick Kenzie is haunted by his catholicism, Dave can't forget his alcoholism.<br />But most of all, Dave Robicheaux speaks in metaphors and aliteration. James Burke is the Poet Laureate of detective writing. The plots are intricate, the friends have tarnished feet along with the hero, and the bad guys, well, they're really bad.<br />All of the series is beautifully crafted. Mistakes he made, loves he cherishes, loyalties he prays for, all of these are part of the man.<br />Black Chery Blues is the beginning of a great series. Start with this one and read them all. You won't be disappointed. James Lee Burke is one of the best. He'll be on your shelf with Lehane, LeCarre, Parker and Crais, and all the rest.	2003-02-18

The early works cast a shadow on the later works because of the brilliance of earlier successes.<br />Likewise Ken Follett gives us white knuckle espionage in \\"Eye of the Needle,\\" a great intricate plot in \\"Night over Water,\\" an extraordinary story in \\"A Dangerous Fortune,\\" and my own favorite, \\"Pillars of the Earth.\\" All early on.<br />So in the last ten years we seem to be stuck in a rut. I thought the recent \\"Jackdaws\\" was just dreadful.<br />If you want to say that Mr. Follett has been hitless for the last several innings, by that comparison \\"Hornet Flight\\" is a darn good read. It is not the Follett we stood in line for (...), but it's still pretty good. My report card:<br />Telling a tale in a venue we know little or nothing about: A+<br />Character development: A<br />Unpredictability of the conclusion: C<br />Dialogue between the two teenage leads: D<br />The Nazis as equal foes, skillful, cunning and scary: D<br />Flying scenes in an old, old airplane: B+<br />All in all, I read it straight through and it kept me turning the pages. Recently, Mr. Follett has embraced a tendency to recite support for virtually every imaginable politically correct group, even though in 1939-40 and 41, there seems to be little evidence to support some of his observations. Frankly, this gets tedious and seems to be almost purposeless.<br />In any event, Hornet Flight is a good tale, a little saccharine in parts but a quality read. Maybe there's another Pillars still out there. We can hope.	2003-02-18

John Corey is the kind of character that pops up in Vietnam as an officer or an enlisted man, on airplanes, or working for \\"the Company.\\" If you like that style of protaganist, wise-cracking, irreverant, rough around the edges, funny but self-effacing nonetheless, you'll enjoy the heck out of Plum Island. If you don't, go back to LeCarre and Furst, two distinguished authors who write great novels and where nowhere in their body of work appear anyone even remotely resembling John Corey.<br />Corey is a New York City Detective recuperating from a near fatal shoot out. He's staying out on Long Island where DeMille grew up and still lives, I understand, in far posher environs.<br />Corey, like all good protagonists, very reluctantly gets drawn into a web of intrigue, lies, arrogance, sex and murder that mark all DeMille (and all good) mysteries.<br />If this is your cup of tea, or glass of beer, or flute of champagne, you're in for a real treat.	2003-02-18

People often have, at least I do, ambivalent feelings about our favorite writers exploring uncharted territory. For example here, with Elvis Cole and Joe Pike, on the one hand we enjoy the dialogue, courage, integrity and overall, the prose of Cole & Pike. We even go to the peculiar step of stating 'which Cole' we like more, the early Cole or the later Cole, or in which novel he's 'more Cole.'<br />But the end result of our attentiveness to Elvis and Joe is predictable. Eventually we'll tire of Cole, or like Spenser, Cole will continue to take on the bad guys while taking metamusil and geritol, both pumping iron . . . and taking it.<br />So we want our favorite authors to explore different characters so we don't know so much about them, so that there still are surprises, and so that we don't get too used to them.<br />In Demolition Angel (great title, Bob), Robert Crais does an exceptional job with Carol Starkey and Jack Pell, using their physical trauma to represent their emotional limitations as well. They want so much to be together and although we're hooked on the pursuit of evil and the drama of the chase, we hook into their characters as well. Kudos to him. And besides, a darn good read, too. I don't know if we'll see Carol again. But I'd like to.	2003-02-08

It would be difficult (if not unbelievable) to claim one is a student of the American novel and not have read Hemingway. And then . . . .read him again.<br />I think there are more enjoyable books. Social maladies and the concept of being \\"lost\\" neither began nor ended in the post World War I era. Lost generations do seem to follow a war. The Civil War for example produced enormous social discontent, and certainly the foolishness called Vietnam produced a generation of, if not lost, hopelessly confused men and women. (Have you seen some of our pictures from 1969?)<br />So while he was drawn to post war Paris, that venue for the odd mix of abusive characters may become irrelevant, knowing what we know now.<br />Having said that, I think that there are two reasons we treat Hemingway with awe. You ever try to write like him? I mean it's a simple paragraph. Staccato thinking. Bang bang bang. Economy of prose. Tightness of verbiage. Compression of thought. Read the extraordinary sentences of him in the Cathedral. Or fly fishing in Spain. Simple, or so it appears. But then try to replicate it. It's nearly impossible.<br />The other point is Hemingway's disguised repetition. He tells us something. Then in a different city, with different characters, forty pages later, he tells us the same thing.<br />Ecclesiastes tells us on page one what the story is about, everything changes, only to repeat itself:  \\"unto the place from [where] the rivers come . . . .they return again.\\"<br />I feel every character speaks for every character. Mike's bankruptcy represents all of their bankruptcy, financial and otherwise; Jake's frustrations are all of their frustrations; Brett's promiscuity not only speaks to all of them, she needs all of them.<br />John Donne's line about the bell tolling for all of us rings true. A brilliant, brilliant book. You may not care for the story but you can't escape Hemingway.	2003-02-03

Griffin's \\"Semper Fi\\" series, in Captain Billy Port, U.S.M.C. They're are both 'China Marines,' underscoring the presence of an American Infantry force in China that in the summer and fall of 1941, had been in Asia since the turn of the 20th century. They both are encouraged by a strong sense of honor or fidelity, have expensive tastes, high intelligence, and have earned the respect of hard men. I am reminded of Orwell's comments that we who are bathed in the warmth of freedom, sleep well because there are 'hard men' who guard our gates. Billy Port, trapped behind enemy lines by the whims of the Japanese government having selected December 7 to bomb Pearl Harbor, doomed by his own sense of honor, recognizing that the only chance he has for himself and his men is to advance smartly in the opposite direction toward Russia, is one of those men.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the novel. It is a novel, we have to remember, although things like that surely happened. Perhaps there was a Billy Port. There certainly were White Russians, Jewish intellectuals, French dilettantes, beautiful courtesans, Mongolian bandits and the above mentioned Marines trying to get the heck out of Dodge when Pearl Harbor happened.<br />Brady, who himself is not unfamiliar with winter in that part of the world, having spent a cold year in the Marine Corps in Korea 9 years after the events described in Warning of War, does an above average job in making the reader 'feel the cold.'<br />You might want to pick up \\"The Coldest War,\\" Brady's auto-biographical account of his year in the infantry in Korea in 1950-51.<br />Additionally, I believe the style of the infantry officer, his concern for men, his focus in times of battle, his remorse for losses, brief but heartfelt, is well reported. At one point Captain Port arises at 2 in the morning to walk the perimeter in 18 below zero weather. He stops and talks to the men on watch, saying a few words to each of them, spending a moment with them. He does that, he tells us, because 'that's what combat officers do. Let the men know that you're willing to spend time with them when it's damn cold.'<br />Despite the tale revolving around the character of this infantry officer, this is really a tale of an event. Billy Port is the central piece of the puzzle, but it's a well crafted story of an escape from the great shadow of war by an odd crew of individuals cast, inadvertantly, behind enemy lines.

If it's the first Carl Hiaasen book you've read, you'll be rolling in the aisles. But if you've read Stormy Weather or Native Tongue (my favorite), you'll be disappointed.<br />Mr. Hiaasen has an extraordinary sense of humor. He's very articulate and has a great delivery. But like a gifted series on television (granted there are few) eventually you run out of plots. And if you continue to use the misunderstood but passionate and cynical but lovable and extremely funny protagonist, who has looked for love in all the wrong places who suddenly finds a fabulous girlfriend AND solves the crime, well pardon the run-on sentence but there's only so many times you can go to that well.<br />If you're going to be comedic, you have to be fresh. Maybe there's a Carl Hiaasen out there who is sitting on a manuscript that's angry, righteous and slick, and not funny. But Basket Case becomes repetitive and tedious. We've heard that joke before. A lot of times. It reminds me of a comedian who goes on a rant. At first you nod your head in agreement. After the 7th or 8th time you realize that the anger and outrage is for effect and it detracts from the message.	2003-01-18

I'm certain you've shared that experience where you are watching someone on the screen just \\"go through the motions\\" and you say, 'he/she 's just \\"mailing it in.\\"<br />That's what Mr. Follett does in this novel. He just mails it in. His dialogue, normally witty and insightful, is boring and superficial. The emotions make no sense. Speaking of the six women in \\"Jackdaws,\\" Follett writes \\"the giggling stopped as they remembered the danger they would face.\\" The giggling?<br />Here's another. Follett describes one of the Nazi, Gestapo, SS Field Grade officers, formerly painted as virtually the devil incarnate, as replying 'grumpily' to a question. The Nazi officer in charge of torturing civilians was grumpy?<br />This has all the earmarks of a movie made with a minimal budget starring all of the actors from the '60's.<br />I like the plot. I like the 'one man [or one woman] might get through' premise.' Us against them. Horatio at the bridge. What I don't understand is the need to force feed political correctness down our throats at every level. It's 1944! The world literally hung in the balance. Yet Mr. Follett lectures us that 'transvestites can be brave,' 'fat, older women can be sabotuers,' and 'love between lesbians is, well, cool.'<br />All of this is true, I guess. I just can't imagine why Mr. Follett uses the platform of the French Resistance on the eve of the invasion of Normandy to remind us. No. Bombard us. We're in the \\"drama\\" section of the bookstore. Diversity; Self-Help; Emotional conflict resolution. They're in the other part of the store. I'm not putting those issues down or making light of them.

An excellent novel.<br />Growing up on the East Coast, I remember old guys who had fought in WWI. One fellow lived into his late 80's with one lung gone, having given the first one up to mustard gas at Belleau Wood. So there's a 'reaching' aspect of Eureka that transcends a number of years. And we really don't feel it. Diehl is able to interrupt conversations in the past, flash forward, come back chapters later to finish them. Very tricky; very well done.<br />Diehl captures the chronology swiftly and smoothly. Sometimes he's writing of events a 100 years ago, sometimes 60, sometimes in between. \\"The bohunk got ironed out in a hit and run.\\" The dialogue is crisp and seemingly accurate. Very timely. Great conversations.<br />Everyone who reads the reviews knows the plot by now. Honest cop, diamond in the rough, investigating the accidental electrocution of a widow in a 1940 bath tub, with only two things out of order: no will and \\"100 large in the bank.\\"<br />A tough WWI veteran about to run for Governor, unanswered questions about the past igniting the future with a 40 year fuse. The quote from Gatsby, 'boats against the current,' is as prescient now as it was then.<br />Some romance that might be too much but everybody finds someone sometime.<br />The best dialogue is found in Elmore Leonard. Diehl gives him a run for his money in Eureka. Strongly recommended.	2003-01-05

Yet Connelly's extraordinary skill at bringing us to see the dark side and then bringing us back, wiser but always a little shaken, remains unparalleled. Harry Bosch. Can there be any doubt that this is Humphrey Bogart 60 years ago? Harry Bosch belongs in the lexicon of the American novel alongside of Dave Robicheaux, Patrick Kenzie, Elvis Cole, Joe Pike, Hawk and the rest.<br />Harry reluctantly gives his partner, Jerry Edgar, New Years Day off and spends the day \\"catching suicides,\\" one a \\"no change of mind\\" and the other an \\"accidental.\\" We are drawn into the dark side of a once heroic profession, cleaning up the detritus of lost and sometimes stolen lives. His new friend \\"Boot\\" Julia Brasher tells him that she hates to clean the vomit out of the back of the squad car. And right away, we know where we are. Like Tchaikovsky's \\"Pathetique,\\" we have a sense that the tale will be beautiful and yet very, very sad.<br />Connelly is a master and possibly after several less than satisfying ventures, this is again classic Bosch. On that same empty New Years Day, a call comes in that an aging Doctor's dog has discovered a child's bone while rooting around Laurel Canyon.<br />What Connelly does perhaps better than anyone else lies in the subtle dialogue of his characters. The petition of the forensic anthropologist, telling Harry that without faith, we are all lost. The conversation with the old Doctor, wealthy, happily binding Harry's broken ribs, who had given 1/2 a century to curing ills but who has no place to go on New Years Day. These are all part of the deep background Connelly paints.<br />The child was a victim of serial abuse and naturally, this triggers recollections of his own lost foster home youth. The conversation with Julia Brasher on how he removed the tatoos from his fists before he went to Vietnam and the brief, understated recitation of his time in the tunnels is orchestrated in such a manner as to make the telling of the story, while not predictable, secondary to the characters.<br />Mike Connelly can still make his point about those who believe that last blue shield can still make a difference with a conversation over a box of donuts.<br />Good stuff.

Jack Mullen longs for the presence of his brother, who died on a deserted but very lucrative piece of beach estate on the eastern tip of Long Island.

Actually four record stores. So successful, Pelecanos points out, his wife Elaine has left him.<br />Right there is an extraordinary subtlety. Pelecanos paints his black characters with the same confusing mish-mosh of emotional color as he does his white characters, saying, 'we are all the same, all confused, all looking for love, losing it, trying to recapture it.'<br />Marcus resists the encroachment of drug dealers in the location of his stores and that resistance turns not surprisingly to bloodshed.<br />Karras, his colorblind Greek friend, suffers the moral dilemma of his own drug habit and recognition of the consequences of his acts.<br />Very compelling; very noir. Highly recommensded.<br />The only caveat I might suggest is that you may want to read some of the earlier works to get a better grip on the personality of the characters. Kudos.	2002-11-24

This is a brilliant biography about a savage sport and what we observers do to the participants. Mark Kram has been criticized by those who feel he takes liberties and cheap shots with the hero-mania of Muhammad Ali and for that matter, \\"Smokin' Joe Frazier. The reality, I believe, is that Kram lifts up the rock and shows us that we live under it. At least from time to time.<br />How can we fail to acknowledge what we did to these two men, what we expected of them, and what we turned them into? How could we expect Ali, who by all accounts while being self described as \\"pretty\\" and certainly personable, was seriously unintelligent, and Joe, who by all accounts, lacking personality, was at least Ali's intellectual equal, to shoulder the extraordinary burdens we placed upon them.<br />We made them symbols of racial upheaval, liberal sexuality, Vietnam, the blue collar worker, the Black Muslims, agitation, revolution and class struggle. All this against the backdrop of the most savage of all sports, witnessed by millions who by the words of Cosell, rightfully castigated by Kram, \\"never played the game.\\"<br />We took athletes and made them spokepersons for issues that Phd's differed on. This would be like having Joe Dimaggio give political insight on the Korean War, Johnny Unitas explain Vietnam, and Micheal Jordon give a seminar on the fall of President Clinton. It doesn't make any sense. This is the use of the 'rock star' to save the whales and the ingenue to push margerine.<br />It doesn't matter who won. Who won had nothing to do with the issues that we described, created, and hoisted upon their backs. They were bound to fail.<br />Finally, the fight in Manila, the third battle of the brain damaging trilogy, just makes you cringe. Kram's book is excellent if you want a flavor of the '70's, the users, the hangers-on, the tragedy, the false issues, and the two hero-victems, Ali and Frazier.	2002-11-13

Like any novel by John LeCarre, you have to work at an Alan Furst novel. It doesn't necessarily come easy.<br />With the poetry of James Burke at his fingertips, and the  haunting portrait of Europe under fire, the truthfully global loss of innocence, Furst begins with a tale that is fascinating for rich, human characters, then for the geography, and finally for the plot. It reminded me of those grainy photographs taken in European train stations in the mid 1930's when people literally ran for their lives.<br />Ilya Serebin is not interested in war, but as Trotsky wrote, \\"war might be interested in [him.]\\" And it is.<br />On escape from beseiged Russia and communism, torn between a safehouse in Paris and his conscience, reluctant to leave a dying lover and a new one playing the deadly game he has been ante-upped for, Serebin is recruited by the OSS to asssist in a \\"cockleshell heroes\\" attempt to block the oil route ('oil, the blood of victory' from which the title is taken] from Romania to Nazi Germany.<br />It is a classic WWII novel of love, betrayal, confusion and sadness. Despair. Melancholy. I can't recommend Alan Furst enough. He may not be your cup of tea or shot of vodka because of the subject matter, but his writing is brilliant. You get a feel of \\"real\\" to the story.	2002-11-11
US	39425588	R1E5Y0ILEFJ7C	0375506233	464158273	Revenge: A Novel	Books	4	2	3	N	N	"Revenge is a dish best served cold."	When Edmond Dantes is wrongfully accused of treason and sent to suffer in near isolation to the watery prison called Chateau d'If, Dumas begins one of the greatest thrillers of all time. It is so good we forget that \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" was written 150 years ago. We are swept up by the unfairness of it all, the betrayal, the lost love, the misappropriation and violation of justice, the never-to-be-returned armed robbery of youth. Naturally, we cheer the painful retribution years later.<br />Stephen Fry makes no bones about lifting Dumas' plot.  Realistically, why should he? It's a great plot, one of only  two dozen or so plots available to any author. Samson bringing down the temple, several thousand years before Alexander Dumas, is a revenge story when stripped of its biblical implications.<br />So when Ned Maddstone, good guy, in love with Portia, athlete, loved teenage son of a former British General, is asked by a dying sailor to deliver a letter to (what he does not know) an Irish-Sinn Fein mole planted in British society, unless we've read of Napleon's request to the young Dantes, we have no idea what tragedy Ned is about to unleash upon himself.<br />It's a great story. Stephen Fry is a true European writer, so we get a view of the world not necessarily American.<br />Good prose, good command of the dialogue, nice use of the language. My only complaint is that the embryo of the story, the planning, the execution, the meeting with Ned's mentor in the mental institution (prison), and the training of Ned in chess, foreign language and 'the art of war' is all very carefully constructed. As he should, Fry brings us along patiently so we can savor what's coming. But then it comes . . . and it's over. The ending is too swift, almost 'time's up; let's off all these bad chaps and have a pint.'<br />Never the less and most importantly, a good, credible novel from an author I would gladly read again.	2002-10-27

Like most young men he was unappreciative of his gift when he had it. Like Roy Hobbs' father tells Roy in \\"The Natural,\\" 'Roy, you have a gift . . .'<br />With a tragic, predictable hubris, Charlie loses his gift. And like Roy, the real life Jim Morris, maybe Kevin Costner's  in \\"For the Love of the Game,\\" he gets a chance to reclaim it.<br />Recapturing it is really just a metaphor for all of our second chances. We all get them; some ignore them and some jump at them. We don't always know why we have this opportunity. We're just fairly certain we won't get a third.<br />So Charlie Stoddard get's a chance with Chang, sort of a 'Hawk-like' Yoda character into healing, and refinds his lost 94 mile an hour fastball.<br />There are no doubt many women will enjoy Mike Lupica's writing. But the real appeal may be to the little boys who grew up with Reggie Jackson and even Kyle Rote and Frank Gifford and Vida Blue and George Brett and Bucky Dent. And the American League. And the designated hitter.<br />The real lesson is somewhat like Gene Shallit wrote about the Rocky I movie in 1975. Shallit wrote, \\". . . it ain't about boxing.\\" And \\"Wild Pitch\\" may not be about baseball. Well. It's probably about baseball with a heavy dose of the moral consequences of your acts.<br />Lupica has  a nice style. I especially enjoyed the dialogue. Mike Lupica is an excellent narrator. The paper better watch out or he'll do this full time.<br />It's a feel good book with Charlie's son finally coming to grips with 'his' gift and an acceptance of his father's frailty and humanity. I prefer H. G. Bissenger's \\"Friday Night Lights\\" but I'll put Lupica next to him.	2002-10-21

In Casablanca, when Claude Rains utters &quot;round up the usual suspects,&quot; undoubtedly he had no idea his throw away line would be used over and over again 60 years later.<br />And that's the key to Griffen's success. He keeps rounding up the cadre of his friends and ours, puts them in harm's way, saves them and moves on.<br />The two things that tire me are present in all of the Griffen novels. Each time he introduces a character for the first time in THE THEN CURRENT book, he spends pages reciting that individual's history, poverty, wealth, bi- and tri- lingual capabiliies, marriage, and life in the Corps since boot.<br />The second thing are those constant, repetitive, boring, childish &quot;second thoughts&quot; in the middle of a conversation. (Why did I say that? Oh. I know why I said that. Because I like this guy and that makes him dangerous.) Or, (I can't believe I want to kiss him? Oh. I know. This guy could be the one.) There are so many of them you forget who's talking and why.<br />Other than that, typical Griffen Corps book. McCoy, his billionaire &quot;hottie&quot; wife, Flem, the promiscuous Pick, Ernie Zimmerman, Major Banning, Milla, Patricia. You know. The usual suspects.<br />This one plods and you need a couple of tumblers of Famous Grouse to get you through the first 100 pages. But then it moves.<br />A better book is James Brady's The Coldest War, but then you wouldn't have billionaire shipping tycoons hanging around with Presidents and knife wielding Marine Captains, and drinking Famous Grouse (what is that stuff and how do cases of it follow him around the world?). If you like Griffen you'll like Under Fire. Not his best but OK.	2002-10-16

Silly	When Robert Parker tells me that \\"tough\\" Boson PI Sunny Randall is \\"cute as Meg Ryan,\\" I have to ask \\"why?\\"<br />Why is it important to know, among other things, that she's cute? I have a picture of a 100 pound woman, cute, who keeps a loaded sawed off shotgun in her bedroom closet. Frankly, I'm perplexed.<br />I don't think it's necessary for women protaganists to be cute. I like cute. Beautiful. Attractive. I just think it's unnecessary for the lead in a mystery noir to be \\"cute.\\" We're not interested. It's irrelevant. It's sexist. I've read all 30+ Spenser novels and I couldn't tell you what he looked like. Ditto Dave Robicheaux in the James Burke series or Elvis Cole in the Robert Crais series. I glanced through some Elizabeth George novels and some Francine Matthews novels and the word \\"cute\\" never came up.<br />On top of that, every man in the book, reticent ex-husbands, former lovers, mobsters, all want to \\"take out the bad guys\\" for her. Yet, she keeps singing that song from the '70's, \\"I gotta' be me!\\" What is it about her that all these men want to help? I mean she's got that darn sawed off shotgun in her bedroom!<br />Finally, I have a hard time not believing that this is just another Spenser novel with the lead a heroine instead of a hero. Matthews and George and dozens of others write some of the best mysteries of our time. But Sunny's got the same friends, the same issues, the same code of conduct as Spenser. She's even got the same dog.<br />And the fact is, Spenser did this 30 years ago in Rachel Wallace, a thousand percent better. That's it for me. Good luck Sunny.	2002-10-16

Well, to start, that's confusing. The embryo for Billy's \\"I'd take a bullet for my friend\\" friendship is extremely vague, exacerbated by the trouble that we all go through, readers included, for the next several hundred pages.<br />But then Doc's teenage daughter is raped and things get dicey. Doc is charged with the torture-murder of the lead biker-suspect and Billy Bob sets out to defend him.<br />I'm troubled by using the rape of a child to further a plot.  Certainly the violation of a human in such an unspeakable fashion is an oft relied upon explanation for revenge, guilt, remorse, retribution and passion. I just don't see the need to use children as victims.<br />I see the real problem in that Billy Bob is like a James Crumley character. As the reader, I spend a lot of time in the company of a man I'm not sure I like. He's promiscuous in his bed partners. He doesn't seem to have been a good father, and continues to remind us of that at every juncture. He's infuriated by the Sheriff in the town, who's kind of a soothsayer or narrator, but never tells us why. He tries to murder one of the protagonists and doesn't understand why this should trouble his friends...<br />Ultimately, the plane never gets off the runway. Lots of turbine noise, lots of baggage handlers, good flight attendants, but we never get anywhere.<br />Dave Robicheaux is a fantastic character, loyal husband, confused yet sacrificing and vulnerable parent, relentless in his code. Billy Bob is kind of tedious. Tedious for 500 pages is, well, tedious.	2002-09-28

Somewhere in the United States there are schools that teach \\"Leonard Dialogue\\" in their writing courses, don't you think? Because clearly nobody writes dialogue like Elmore Leonard.<br />He doesn't really require much of a plot and frequently doesn't bother giving us one. He can be in Cuba at the time of the Maine or Rawanda 10 years after the genocide. It doesn't really matter. Leonard writes about people, not necessarily good people, and what they say to eachother. And the thing is, as we traverse life's highways, even if we've been lucky to avoid hit men and racist scoundrels and drug traffickers, scammers, con men and con women, we end up believing that if we had known such people, this is what they would say to eachother.<br />Here we have another collection of oddballs bent on an entire panoply of various goals. Dennis wants to keep diving the 80 foot board and fall in love, probably not in that order, and Robert wants to love the wife of his boss and make a lot of money, probably not in that order. And involved with them is a cast of the usual suspects, villains, idiots, lost souls, alcoholhics, exiled lovers, misplaced wives and bad guys. And girls.<br />With Tishomingo, we get a course in Delta Blues Music, con games, and falling in love. A little violence, a little sex, and the best dialogue being written today. The heroes aren't that heroic and the choices are vague and ambiguous. And the stories that are told and the promises made are usually lies.<br />But it's enjoyable and a must read if your a Leonard fan. And I will read him again. And probably again, in that order.	2002-09-22

Or a least they start out convincing us that various people that we have known in our lives might have gotten themselves in this kind of fix.<br />But the truth be known, silk stocking law firms don't ever hire blue collar hard cases, and the State Disciplinary Commission never licenses lawyers who have been in jail. But no matter, we like Dan Ames, tough guy turned articulate lawyer seeking justice, in kind of a graduate school version of &quot;can't we all be friends?&quot;.<br />Dan's got the age old problem that every young lawyer gets asked by pretty girls at parties, &quot;how do you defend someone whom you know is guilty?&quot;<br />Justice Cardoza once said, &quot;when the lawyers tell you it's not about the money, it's about the principle . . . it's about the money.&quot;<br />And here the money is about the defense of a birth control pill that causes horrific birth defects. Sensitive topic (albeit not as sensitive as some of the real life issues Mr. Margolin has dealt with, for which we Margolin fans all wait patiently.)<br />But the problem with the characters is that we never get to know them. They're superficial. Kate falls in love with Dan, but all she can tell us is that he's &quot;a nice guy.&quot; There's a villain in here, actually several, but we're not sure how they got there.<br />Having said that, Mr. Margolin treats his characters equally well, with strong women and inquisitve, apologetic men. So in the words of my children, that's kind of cool.<br />A good fast read. Well written and exciting. Worth the price.	2002-09-21

He takes a case for all the wrong reasons, and then Crumley shows us that he would likely as not have taken the case even if he had known the right reasons. If there were any right reasons.<br />He falls in love with Helen Duffy and offers to help find her lost brother.<br />He has the wrong information from the wrong friends. He is disliked by any and all that would help him, misled by clients, aided by winos and criminals, and continually sifts through misinformation, disinformation and lies. But it's tough to ferret out the truth when you're going from one binge to the next.<br />It's difficult to find something redeeming about Milo except there is a certain nobility in his tenacity. The characters are strong. This is dark mystery and not for the weak of heart. But it is particularly native to America and the American myth of the hardboiled Private Eye. We're talking hardboiled. Vintage Mike Hammer and Phillip Marlowe.<br />Good stuff. And life goes on after it's all done. At least for Milo.	2002-09-04

So like John LeCarre's image of \\"love your country, fear your government,\\" virtually everyone has a hidden, perhaps evil agenda.<br />But DeMille is a master storyteller and the descriptions are vivid, beautiful and frightening. His recreation of the Cathedral at night, with two terrorists playing Gaelic hymns on the organ and bells, is extraordinary. An excellent novel told of strife thousands of miles away brought to the five boroughs of New York.<br />One point. It's one of DeMille's earlier works written in the early '80's. Readers might recollect some of the Catholic - Protestant tensions that are now gratefully dimminishing.<br />Classic DeMille. Worth the effort.	2002-09-04

My Dad went to the gathering of WWII vets, both sides, of the invasion of Normandy nearly a decade ago. It was an undefined moment in America so naturally, it became defined by the photo journalists and television crews. And to their credit, it was terribly moving and was depicted with honor and sensitivity. Yet I recall it was difficult to appreciate what these old men had accomplished, because, well, we weren't there. And try as we did we couldn't extrapolate the fear, courage, terror and youthfulness of that instant.<br />And Nelson DeMille takes on a similar journey to his anguished youth, Vietnam. The A Shau Valley. Khe Sahn. Quang Tri. Hue. Cam Rahn Bay.<br />So you have to start out with the fact that Mr. DeMille is writing of his past. Travelogue? I'm not sure. That's kind of harsh.<br />Paul Brenner lands at Saigon, Ho Chi Minh City, and begins his journey to a village in North Vietnam to track down a witness to the murder of an American Officer in the center of an ongoing battle in 1968. So certainly it's a difficult task, and I think DeMille does it well.<br />That DeMille often writes of numerous acts of violence, love, sex, betrayal, and retribution, and does it extremely well, shouldn't become the standard for the quality of this book.<br />Paul Brenner is sarcastic, cynical, funny, tedious, angry and smart. These are all the usual qualities of the Nelson DeMille hero. And they're present here, too. That he is contacted by Susan Weber, who like Paul is not all that she appears, is also not far from the DeMille norm. At one point she accuses him of hypocrisy saying, inter alia, 'you lied to me, I lied to you. Why am I held accountable for the lies I told and your lies are justified?'<br />And of course that's true. Paul Brenner is given only a few facts and we are asked to figure out the evidence with him as he goes along. And we do.<br />It's a long trip. But those guys on Omaha and Utah Beaches had a long trip, too. So we should cut DeMille some slack. I believe Nelson DeMille has paid his dues. He's written thousands of pages and millions of words. Once in awhile an author will ask his readers to take a chance and listen to a different story.<br />Paul Brenner writes to his boss, Karl Hellman, \\"the shadows of the past are long but if anything happens to me I am glad that I came.\\" Paul is having an (that horribly overused word) epihany.

Europeans continually criticize Americans for having as much vicarious pleasure in building our heroes up, as we do in then tearing them down.<br />So we start with Robert Crais' quintesential duo, Elvis Cole and Joe Pike. But they're not all. Dave Robicheaux is the creation of James Lee Burke. And of course Angie and Patrick from Dennis Lehane; Lord Lynley and Barbara Havers from Elizabeth George; Lucas Davenport from John Sandford.<br />But as a reader, one of the thousands who revel in the dialogue, the gritty prose, the intimacy of the characters, and the plot, I have to wonder how much can these characters take? Adultery; alcoholism; the loss of a child, a mate, a partner; the breaching of trust; injury; beatings.<br />So after awhile one hopes that the author will utilize his or her enormous talent, and bring us down a new path, a new road, a new adventure.<br />Lehane has his Mystic River and Sean Devine; Crais created his Carol Starkey. And sometimes we forget why we wanted these new characters. Because the old ones couldn't do anything else. They had done it all. They needed a vacation. And often we are critical of such literary courage. It has to be tough to cash in your chips on a completely commercial success and start anew. I would imagine it takes more than a little courage.<br />So with that, Robert Crais introduces Jeff Talley, former LAPD S.W.A.T. hostage negotiator, running from his self inflicted torture, now up to his neck in deja vu.<br />I won't tell you the plot or the outcome. I like the idea that Hostage is an enormous play on words and that we are all  hostages of our past until we reconcile that the past has no grip on the present. But Robert Crais didn't tell me that and either does Jeff Talley.<br />This is a good book. Really, I give it 4 1/2 stars. Enjoy one of our best contemporary writers at his craft. I'm sure Elvis and Joe will ride again and we can go back to them and chuckle at their witicisms. Well, we can chuckle at Elvis. Joe doesn't say much.<br />But Hostage is the real deal.

In the subsequent conflagration, his corpse remained remarkably preserved.<br />Despite his height and weight, obviously being quite smaller than us, the presence of muscular tone and apparent physical strength is both startling and revealing. National Geographic did an extraordinary photo-essay on this about 15 years ago.<br />Needless to say, these men and women were at least physically the same as us 2000 years later.<br />Sienkiewicz describes for us the debauchery of ancient Rome under the aegis of Emperor Nero and the blossoming of Christianity.<br />The dialogue of the early Christians is, while not disturbing, distracting. By example, Stephen Pressfield's dialogue between Leonidis and the emissaries of Xerxes in Gates of Fire is  wholly conjectural. Likewise, Vinicius' coversations with Paul of Tarsus and Peter are also guesswork.<br />Yet, this is a brilliant story of societal conflict, love and treason. One is reminded of some of the correspondence between Lord Acton and the Pope of Rome hundreds of years later. Acton wrote, \\"Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\\"<br />And the backdrop of this remarkable love story between a Christian Princess and one of the battle weary Tribunes of Rome is one of total immorality and corruption.<br />Additionally, we get to read a novel over a 100 years old. The first printing of Quo Vadis is in 1896 so we see a great historical romance in a style a century old. No quips here. No witty remarks between Danny Glover and Mel Gibson. It's hard times with Super Bowl-like events in the Coliseum where the losers get eaten.<br />It's great read. You really can't go wrong with one of the first \\"best sellers\\" ever written.

The story he tells is not how it should have been, it's not even how he would have liked it to have been. It's like it was. Brady is like any other 19 year old, brash, filled with adventure, drunk on promise and the illusion of immortality. Then he signs up with the Marine Reserves if not avoid, then to postpone his own appointment with destiny. Unfortunately, destiny has a mind of its own, and a few years later he finds himself the Platoon Commander of a Marine Rifle platoon on Hill 749, in the winter of 1951, in Korea.<br />Brady doesn't judge. I like that most about his reflections on a horrible war in a freezing place. If you want to hang Truman, MacArthur, Eisenhower, and John Foster Dulles, this is probably the wrong book for you. It is brilliant but it tells only the story of one man-boy's experience placed in charge of 40 men in combat.<br />To some extent we look down on those boys. We judge them, forgetting that like us, they too were caught in the flotsam of other people's decisions. Although with most of us, the whole world doesn't subsequently judge us. War's change, the technology of killing becomes more sophisticated, sides change, enemies become friends, and bad guys become good guys.  Frequenly we forget that it's the young men who take the fire. The greatest homily to Brady and the only self serving remark he makes would be truly understood by a few.

We should not judge those boys. And we should not judge them after they become men. 5 stars. A sobering read.To Jim Brady, if no one told you, welcome home.	2002-07-15

You see snippets of that in Brady's The Coldest War about the Marines in Korea, as well as contemporary historical reports. We love it. When Xerxes sends an emissary to the Hot Gates to permit the remaining Spartans to live and asks for their shields, Leonidas, already mortally wounded says, \\"Come and get them.\\" This is not unlike Colonel Puller at the Frozen Chosin Reservoir in Korea in 1950, who when told they were surrounded by 10 Divisions of the Communist Chinese, quipped \\"now we got 'em where we want 'em.\\"<br />We cheer. We applaud. It's Horatio at the Bridge; the 600 at Balaclava; the Brits at Roarke's Drift.<br />Yet what we really have never established is the balance between that \\"all or nothing\\" society, and our contemporary life (for the most part in the USA) in a civilized society. We can't send men to die. We can send them to fight valiently and maybe die, but we can't send them to die. And, as the heroes of Vietnam learned, sometimes we take those innocents and villify them.<br />So it's a great story. But it's real fiction for two reasons, one because it can't happen again and two, because we're not sure it really ever did happen.<br />It does contain a great picture of life 24 centuries ago. A very worthwhile, compelling  read. However, like the PG-13 caveat, it is very gory.	2002-07-12

Potshot is trembling in the shadow of a bunch of hoods (cowhoods?) demanding weekly \\"pertecksion\\" money. Spenser travels out west (this is only peculiar if you haven't read the preceding 30 odd novels) and realizes it's time to call in some favors. There's Hawk of course, equally literate and only a shade less Homeric, his gay friend from Atlanta, Vinnie from the mean streets of Boston, Chollo, a Mexican hitman from LA, his (Chollo's) native american friend, the homophobic Bernard from Las Vegas, hmmmm, there might be a couple more. And of course the unsinkable Susan.<br />This is great Spenser. Still blinded by Susan, like Caesar's wife, above reproach, jabbing with the left, hooking with the right, quoting Shelley and Keats.<br />My favorite still remains 'Rachael Wallace' and some of the more definitive views of a man of high values for himself, who like Stills sang in the same generation, having \\" . . a code that he can live by.\\"<br />If you've missed the Spenser series, pick up some of the early ones and see where Crais and Lehane and Coban earned their spurs. It's still great stuff. Unpretentious. Inspirational. Funny. Worthwhile.	2002-07-03

If you taught a University level course on the mystery-noir, this would follow Hammett and Chandler and precede James Lee Burke and George Pelicanos. Additionally, W.C. Sughrue, Crumley's (I hesitate to say hero) lead, places us smack dab in the middle of the post Vietnam, pot-smoking, alcohol drenched seventies. So we get a chance to travel back in time, a time which some of us have forgotten by choice, and recollect how foolish we were. And Sughrue reminds us of all of that, because he readily embraces the release points of that decade: sex; drugs; rock `n roll.<br />The dialogue is tight, realistic and sensible. I suppose the drawback is that all of the characters are such low lifes. Even the good guys you wouldn't hang around with if you had a choice. Sughrue, unlike Elvis Cole, Spenser and Dave Robicheaux, doesn't do the right thing, really isn't faithful too much and really has . . . . well, no standards.<br />But I have to rate it high. It has no pretenses. It is what it is. A good, tight, straight, melancholy, angry story about angry people in angry times, who weren't very nice to begin with. Worth your time.	2002-06-28

Vietnam veteran, bereaved father of a lost child, lawyer, bartender, bar owner, lawyer again, and, championship dart thrower.<br />Hard Evidence is a play on words, I think, balancing on the fulcrum between lots of circumstantial evidence, individually or piece by piece not compelling, and direct evidence. In a manner of speaking, this Wigmore definition on evidentiary substance mimics life.  Hardy's ex-wife, Jane, remains his friend and becomes, inter alia, his current wife's friend. I would think that the first circumstance would be difficult; the second preposterous.<br />Hardy has joined (again) the San Francisco DA's office as a junior prosecutor, and inherits, almost by accident, a homicide case involving Owen Nash, an enormously wealthy financier. Hardy investigates his partner's status, exponentially more wealthy now that Nash is dead, the sexually obsessive daughter, the Japanese prostitute that Nash fell in love with, all the while drinking a huge amount of alcohol and having a lot of sex.<br />Lescroart seems to be on the periphery of becoming a \\"sought after author\\" like Parker, Crais, and Burke, and to a lesser extent, Lehane and Pelicanos. You can see people ordering up in a bookstore or e-mailing Amazon asking, \\"when's the release date on the next Lescroart?\\" Or, if they're fairly young, \\"when's the release date on the next Lescroart, dude?\\" But although this is a 1991 novel, even now he seems to be still just on the edge.<br />The writing is excellent; the plots are intricate and like a form-fitting rug, interwoven. I would say, too interwoven. And that amplifies that the interwoven characters are just, well . . . weird. Unbelievable. To follow the implied legalese, incredible.<br />Nash, who has 8 gazillion dollars, falls in love with a prostitute. Wants to marry her. Not live with her. Marry her. As in, \\"Honey, what time are Trevor and Brie coming over to play Bridge?\\" Imperil the whole financial house of cards because at the age of sixty, darn it, it's time he did something for himself. Dismas is constantly having sex with his wife. OK, this is good. He worships her and her child, Rebecca. Also good. Yet he fools around, literally, with Nash's daughter. As they say on ESPN, \\"what's up with that?\\"  Frannie, the current pregnant wife, is friends with Jane, the ex-wife, and they're all friends with Andy, the ex-father in law, who has his own secrets. The prosecutor is sleeping with the DA, one of Detectives on the staff, and another DA. Yeah. That's why the books are not in the inner circle.

LeCarre weaves a tale of deception, broken trusts, conspiracy, murder, becoming of age, and retribution. In that regard, this wonderfully written novel strikes several chords similar to his 1970's - `80's novels. The KGB/CIA becomes Three Bees, a pharmaceutical monopoly intent on sucking the life out of the African countryside. The British Government remains the same as any government, duplicitous, dishonest, uncaring of individual life, greedy and ineffectual. Africa represents innocence; it's government, pimps. The characters are frequently cowardly; the protagonists often confusing.<br />Tessa Quayle is the young wife of Justin Quayle, a career Foreign Service Officer. Passionate about the death of Africa, she embraces the causes of AIDS, tuberculosis, spiraling downward poverty, sexual abuse and the imprisonment of women. Where she is a whirling dervish of ideas, hopes, tears and prayers, he is nonchalant and distracted. She loves him and recognizes the danger lying beneath still waters. She protects him, and early on, reportedly trapped in an affair with a Nigerian Doctor, she is murdered.<br />Like many of LeCarre's heroes, Justin Quayle becomes resolute in proving his worth, but more importantly his wife's worth. After a certain passage of time for mourning, he announces `Tessa's mission (is) henceforth (my) own.'<br />Here's the deal on LeCarre. He is a brilliant author. Yes, he takes 100 words when 15 would do. Yes, there are some long paragraphs, long pages, and long chapters. He uses words like macabre, polemic, winged seraph, lank and inconsolable.<br />He also writes beautifully. He is the kind of writer in which the words occasionally sound like music. He drafts the kind of sentences you want to read a few times over because of the way the words flow out of your mouth. He writes of resignation \\"dumped at the railway station with bad memories and promises.\\" Later, when he grows into the idea of what he must do, LeCarre says, \\"freed of his burden, he moved with symbolic lightness. Sharper lines defined his features. A strange light burned behind his eyes.\\"<br />But this should not go unnoticed. Do you want to read something light and superficial? Do you want to read something akin to a TV movie? If you want to read something fast like an airplane novel, don't buy Hermann Melville. Don't buy Leo Tolstoy.  Stay away from William Manchester. Watch out for John Keegan. And for Heaven's sake. Stay away from John LeCarre.<br />This book is the main course, not an appetizer. This is the main event, not the undercard.

In a world in which he makes no pretense about being illusional, his characters seem real. At least insofar as they reside in an unreal world. Wyatt Gillette is incarcerated in the California Penal System for . . . something.<br />I liked \\"The Blue Nowhere.\\" So let me get my solitary criticism out. It seems for us troglodytes and cave dwellers who were alive when HAL made his appearance in 2001, the movie not the year, we are left to surmise that there are bad computer crimes, and then there are good computer crimes. Somehow the latter has a Sherwood Forest smell to it. A gorgeous and loving (but innocent) Maid Marion; rowdy but loyal men singing songs of freedom and togetherness; the smell of pine needles; the squeal of children; and a concerted effort by Robin to screw up the evil empire by robbing them blind. Which by the way, even in King John's time, was a felony.<br />Anyhow, regardless of my cynicism over the \\"good\\" crimes, Wyatt Gillette is temporaily freed from prison to help capture the demonic Phate (John Sandford and Thomas Harris come to mind). We are led to believe that given the right set of facts and alignment of the planets, Wyatt might also get his wife back, whom he loves desperately, but oddly enough is still harboring a grudge over his felony conviction. OK. OK. I've run it into the ground.<br />I like Deaver because I can count on him to be truthful to his characters. Wyatt isn't necessarily applauded for joining the team. Most dislike him. All distrust him. And his ex slaps him silly at their first encounter<br />But for the most part there is a lack of grotesque description of the victims and simultaneously, you start to like the characters. It's fiction. You have to suspend a bit of your common sense. Phate's a bad dude (read 'play on words') and Wyatt's at a minimum a not-so-bad-dude.<br />I found the technology to have a ring of credibility to it. I don't believe that Deaver is a hacker, at least so he says in the Author's Notes, and yet he seems to have researched his topic well. His characters are not the stereotypical characters with the stereotypical problems including (1) clean cut sensitive guy, (1) slovenly but darn loyal friend who eats terrible fast food, (2) busted marriages, (3) twists in the narrative, (1) close black friend, (1) close gay friend, man or woman, it doesn't matter, and (1) nagging, whimpering partner who constantly urges the Homeric lead to \\"give it all up and let's just be together.\\"<br />No. Deaver's characters are a bit bruised by life, not necessarily funny at all, and not too forgiving. And even at the end, most of them still don't like Gillette.<br />I'll read some more.thor's Notes, and yet he seems to have researched his topic well.

Its heroes carry with them the limp of painful beginnings. It's villains are often visionaries; its protagonists, short sighted.<br />Meet Sean, growing up in the poor section of Beantown, the most gifted of a band of 11-year old vagabonds, secretly jealous of Jimmy, born on the wrong side of the tracks, if there is such a place when you're already downtrodden. And finally there's Dave, the most severally emotionally crippled of the three, born into poverty and confusion, journeying into middle age and alcohol because he couldn't think of anything better to do.<br />Jimmy ends up with his own crime crew and does hard time in prison. Sean ends up as a decorated Statie Officer who confuses love with ownership and loses his wife. And Dave never survives the crimes against him as a child.<br />It's an amazing book. Kudos to Lehane, who temporarily put aside the on again off again lovers of his Pentology. What else could he have them do? But if you briefly thought Lehane lacked vision, grace and courage, read this novel. He takes chances and reminds us of his most-valuable-rookie-of-the-year awards. He's not running the sprint races. Settle back for the marathon.<br />Sometimes those who are cowards in the face of ignorance are punished. Sometimes those on the path of righteousness are rewarded with justice, albeit in a different direction. And evil is always punished. We hope. Eventually. If you are a mystery novel fan, put aside the hip talking, super sensitive, \\"I'm into cross gender issues and saving the planet\\" accidental Horatios, and get your hands dirty.<br />This is the real deal. This is a great book.	2002-06-03

In fact, with the exception of Robert Crais' Elvis Cole, I can't recall any author who will repeatedly make me laugh out loud. I was in a Dentist's office in Jackson, Michigan, waiting for a root canal (no lie) and read about Myron Bolitar's relationship with \\"Big Cyndi.\\" I laughed out loud. Mothers moved their children away from my couch. The receptionist looked sternly at me.<br />I guess that's the problem I have. Mr. Coben seems to have the need to be all things to all people. Humorist. Philosopher. Retributionist. He reminds me of the \\"Lethal Weapon\\" directors (I think there were more than one) who wanted humor, racial sensitivity, a code of honor, love, pathos, retribution, introspection and everything else in the self-help bookshelf.<br />When you can't make a decision as to who you are writing for and you decide to write for everyone, your audience loses track of where they are. 'Am I sad now or is this a funny part?'<br />I like things more direct. I had the same problem with \\"Tell no One,\\" Mr. Coben's most recent venture. I couldn't make up my mind what I had just heard so I would tell no one.<br />Pick a virtue; stick with it. Pick a vice, stay with it. Myron is brave, yet cowardly. In supposed love, yet with a wandering eye. He is offended by the amorality of Win, yet always calls him to clean up his mess. Refuses to punish the evil villain, yet arranges then pushes the dominos over in a fashion that will lead the villain to far more suffering. And like another character I just can't cheer for, Robert Parker's Jesse Stone, abused by the woman he loves (could 'doormat' be tattooed on his forehead?) but stickin' around for more.<br />That's it for me.	2002-05-14

This is his strength. Here we are introduced to Fr. Terry Dunn, a missionary Catholic priest in Rwanda. Dunn drinks Johnny Walker and sleeps with his housemaid. I had visions of Humphrey Bogart and an obscure old movie with Spencer Tracy called \\"The Devil at 4 O'Clock.\\" 'I have lost my faith but I'll help them keep theirs'.<br />We are told that after 5 years, missionary priests are permitted to go home to \\"refresh\\" and to raise money for the missions. Terry goes home to Michigan and does a lot of refreshing with the funny, felonious Debbie Dewey. We also learn that Father Terry left Detroit shortly before he was about to be arrested following a Federal indictment. And then we realize that raising money for the Rwandan missions might be no more than a ploy and a scam. Halfway through the book we come to the conclusion that not only have we no \\"connection\\" with Terry or Debbie, they kind of disgust us.<br />The conversations with the Mutt, Johnny Pajonny and Randy are vintage Leonard and worth the price of admission. Or at least the price of the paperback. And the cross examination of Father Dunn by his sister-in-law, Mary Pat, is worthy of the belief that most hard working mothers raising teenage daughters are tough enough to go 5 or 6 rounds with a solid middleweight. My problem is with Rwanda as the back drop for sex, drugs and rock 'n roll. And a lot of humor.<br />We don't know much about the Rwandan genocide and if we are to believe Bernard Goldberg in \\"Bias,\\" the reason we don't is because the big three networks don't see it as a money making story. Come on. You know about the Irish Protestants and Catholics, right? And certainly, could we learn anymore about Palestine and Israel? Kosevo? Yeah. That was pretty well covered. We're making movies about it now. Must be important.<br />But did you know that in Rwanda, one million natives were slaughtered, in many instances by machetes, in 90 days! I don't know why we don't know more about it. I mean to say why we know so much about certain stories but virtually none about this one. Some pundits suggest the very unpleasant possibility that there is a racial undertone here.

I like Harlan Coben and gratefully, he will be around for a long time. I look forward to reading another Cobenesque tale, but not like this one.<br />He is a master of plot, unfolding one surprise after another. The problem is that some of the surprises qualify as surprises only because they are completely unbelievable. Look at Alfred Hitchcock. He was successful because he took ordinary people like James Stewart (Rear Window) and Cary Grant (North by Northwest) from ordinary jobs (photographer; sales manager) and exposed them by accident to extraordinary events (witness to murder most foul; mistaken for a KGB counter agent). But they were ordinary folks and remained ordinary.<br />Dr. Beck seems to be disengenuous, almost dishonest. And what bothers me here, is that he is disengenuous with me, the reader, who plunked down X amount of dollars to listen to his story.<br />Let me give you an example. If I scrape the bumper of our car at the mall, I may forget to tell my wife; if the nordic blond secretary kisses me on the cheek for my birthday at the office, lacking any kamikaze-like inclinations, I may avoid telling my wife; if I take my sons to the Lions game, and they overhear some foul language from a row behind us, I may elect to not tell my wife. But if I see her boss robbing a bank, if I witness a shoot out between armed insurrectionists, these are things I'm going to share with my partner.<br />And Dr. Beck doesn't do that. He leaves things out, doesn't give her the information he ought to have. For someone that he has worshipped since the second grade, he witholds certain information from her.<br />She is murdered he believes and he still weeps for her 8 years later but they had secrets from eachother. I think the simplest but honest relationships wouldn't keep those kinds of secrets from their spouse.<br />It's a good action read. Lots of twists. I'm left with the feeling that it was written for another medium that absolutely pays no attention to logic, ergo the movies.<br />I'll read Mr. Coben again but frankly I was disappointed.

You could buy a Giant comic on The Lone Ranger, one or two on the Green Lantern, one on Superboy, and get change from a dollar. At some point, the comic powers to be determined it would be more profitable to channel the virtues of the super heroes together. How hard would this be to believe? Not only did we live in a world with a Batman and his androgenous sidekick, his homeboy was Superman! And eventually, the three of them  hooked up with Captain America!<br />The end result was, it didn't work. The heroes had certain virtues that when juxtaposed against ultimate evil, shone even more brightly. When they worked together, they seemed kind of silly.<br />That's what I found to be the case with A Darkness More Than Night. Connelly is a first rate author. There is no doubt about that. His Harry Bosch quartet, The Black Echo, The Black Ice, The Concrete Blond and The Last Coyote are first rate literature comparable to anything written by Chandler or Parker or Crais. The Poet, for other reasons, introduces Terry McCaleb and in it's own way, excels. Angels Flight, ditto. Void Moon, ditto. But in all those cases/stories, the hero lives and dies by his own wits.<br />In this case, we put McCaleb and Bosch together, and frankly, both end up the worse for wear. McCaleb makes an enormous mistake that one has the feeling a first year profiler wouldn't make. Bosch, on the other hand, comes off seedy, almost like a second rate gumshoe out of Spillane.<br />Additionally, I am beginning to find it tedious that all profilers are looked upon by their spouses as having to descend into the caverns of Hell in order to pay the rent. John Sandford does this in his Lucas Davenport series. Susan is always trying to talk Spenser out of matching wits with the bad guys, because somehow, I guess, it changes them and maybe, we are led to believe, in a parapsychological sort of way, the men they love will never come back.<br />Come on. This is Starksky and Hutch schtick. This is Chips. Graciela is crying in the dining room because Terry is going back. To where? Earn a living? Keep his job? We don't know, but we hope and pray he will be OK.<br />Finally, the first 130 pages were brutal. A struggle. Trying to get across the street. Swimming against the tide.<br />Skip this one.

First of all, I enjoy Pelecanos more than any mystery writer I'm reading now. His dtories are gritty. It's Raymond Chandler with enhanced First Amendment Rights. It's a movie both by David Mammet and Jerry Bruckmeier. The writing is compact and concise. There's nary a wasted line or paragraph. The prose is tight. And heroes live from paycheck to paycheck. And girlfriends don't wait for good guys who are \\"works in progress.\\" It's not Danny Glover and Mel Gibson.<br />In \\"Right as Rain,\\" Terry Quinn is a competant white police officer. One night in a semi-hostage situation, Terry kills a black man on the mean streets of Washington. The victim, who clearly put himself in harms way, was also a police officer, only tonight, his night off, he was wearing street clothes.<br />All involved, IAD, most of his friends and the Police Department in general, exonerate Quinn. The killing, they sing as a Greek Chorus, was rightful. Given the overwhelming evidence that Quinn acted as any police officer would have acted, without the issue of race in any way being present, his shield and his gun are  returned.<br />But Pelecanos and the readers aren't quite sure. And I guess either is Terry Quinn, because he quits the force.<br />These are several stories at once. Redemption. The death of denial. Self-awareness. Retribution. The attempt if not to do the right thing, to do the next right thing. And a lot of it has to do with members of two differing races that have harmed eachother so much, and the lack of a roadmap on how to end ignorance and begin breaking bread together.<br />The victim's mother asks Derek Strange, an older, retired African American, now a private investigator, to help clear her son's name. Thus begins an intricate story, and the loose bond of friendship between Quinn and Strange.<br />I think what's unique about Pelecanos is his uneasy sharing of things close to their race between black men and white men. Because we don't get along. And we have to. Some have criticized Pelecanos as sermonizing but I think he's just giving us his roadmap of how to get out of the tricky situation that we put ourselves in.

US	39425588	R13VH5SAMY11WS	0895261901	148709607	Bias: A CBS Insider Exposes How the Media Distort the News	Books	5	2	6	N	N	(Almost) All the News that's Fit to Print	Bernard Goldberg worked for CBS for 28 years. From civil rights to AIDS, this man had (and does have) an extraordinary resume. His body of work is what aspiring journalists, I would hope, learn from. Are inspired by. Is sought to be replicated. However, there was a certain madness in his work. A level of hidden insaniy. Mr. Goldberg felt there was a liberal bias in the way CBS, NBC and ABC presented the news.<br />He didn't want a conservative presentation, he just felt that there was no balance to the news. He acknowledges he's a liberal, or, more liberal than conservative. He just stated that there was no voice from the loyal opposition. So he asked for a forum to air his views. Doors were slammed. Windows shut. And he was totally ignored.<br />And then he committed a Garden of Eden level sin. He went to the Wall Street Journal and wrote an article on the liberal emphasis of the network news. And that was the end of an illustrious career.<br />On a much more subjective level, I've often wondered how CBS, NBC and ABC get the stories they present. If you are paid by the amount of fans you have, surely the selection of stories becomes important. Paul McCartney doesn't do rap. And The Who decided against doing a Gershwin medley. Erode the fan base equals no money. So when the success of your business is to be better than the two huge businesses putting out exactly the same product you are, how do you sell your product in a way that's better than the competition? The station telling the best news, best, gets the most viewers. And somehow, using a formula that would have left Albert Einstein scratching his head, that means more money.<br />Well the stories I saw for decades didn't make much sense. And I am happy and relieved that Bernard Goldberg saw he same hing I saw. They were important stories, no doubt, about AIDS and the Homeless  and why Bill Clinton was the victim of a massive Republican plot. But I didn't know anybody who felt the way Tom and Peter and Dan was telling me to feel. It was for the most part, 'this is how we feel and this is how you ought to feel unless you're an ignorant Druid living in the uncharted land west of the Hudson.'<br />The other thing that struck me was that there were nations in unpopular foreign countries that were dying.  I mean the entire country was evaporating without so much as an Armani clothed Britt Hume or Sam Donaldson saying a homily. An obit. These stories got no coverage and yet, two income couples in Manhattan making six figures each and \\"oy, the guilt\\" of putting young Brie into day care, these stories got serials. Docu-dramas. By all three networks.<br />So I did the only thing I could do. I changed the channel. I watch O'Reilly and ESPN. Every other year I switch over and see Tom getting more (I think the polite phrase is) thick waisted, Dan, like Dorian, unchanged with nary a mark on his face, and Peter, well Peter's just so darn GQ. Then I quickly turn back to O'Reilly in case there's a chance I might catch the horrific, truly terrifying  things the Troika is talking about if I don't get my middle aged stuff together.<br />And now I know why. Bernard Goldberg squealed. He ought to be in the Witness Protection Program but he's out here telling us what we always suspected but were afraid to assume.<br />The evening news is ENTERTAINMENT! It's not news, it's SHOW BUSINESS. And, (Ethel Merman, where are you babe?) \\"There's no Business Like Show Business!\\"<br />So, this is a great book. It should be required reading for every kid in high school or college. I'm a Bernard Goldberg fan. Keep on writing!s telling me to feel.

Reading some of the reviews of Spencerville, I'm surprised DeMille had the guts to ever pick up a pen again. He's a sexist. He's cruel to women. His hero is an idiot, blinded to the emotional superficiality of the woman he pines for. And the villain, Cliff Baxter, is a bad, bad man. We can hope he's worse than DeMille is in real life.<br />All of this criticism of the whims and vicissitudes of the FICTIONAL characters reminds me of, to name a few, Hemingway, Dumas, Ludlum, Chandler and Michner. I think Michner wrote 750,000 pages without treating women like anything but fleshy Tonka toys.<br />So I like DeMille. And I read to be entertained. Wilbur Smith. Dennis Lehane. Robert Parker. Francine Matthews. Elizabeth George. All of these people create events that I have never seen replicated in my life, with heroes and heroines who do things I could never do. That's why, I think, it's called fiction.<br />I like Keith Landry and I like Annie Prentiss because they both made mistakes. Landry thought that if he helped clear the woods of dragons, someone would care. There are men like this. I have been lucky to know a few. I suspect DeMille is one of them. And Annie never realized that she didn't have to SETTLE on anyone who came along. Prince Charming may only live in Reader's Digest or Redbook or Cosmo, but there are some good guys out there and Keith Landry was one of them. And he came back for her.<br />Golly. I must have been completely misled. I think that's kind of inspirational. We make mistakes, we have the courage to ask for forgiveness, and the people we choose to be with have the fortitude and the wisdom to forgive us. Then we move on.<br />So it's a love story. Maybe that's where DeMille let us down. He didn't tell us that he was going to write about would-be-heroes after the war was over. After Vietnam was shown for the charade it was with 60,000 dead and 10 times that number emotionally crippled. Maybe he should have warned us that he, having served in Vietnam, like the aforementioned Dumas, was writing \\"Twenty Years After.\\"<br />Billy Marlons belongs on The Wall, with the footnote \\"for wounds suffered 13,000 miles away and 20 years ago.\\"<br />And the Porters were idiots who smoked too much grass, but that's what happens when you do a lot of herb.  And Charley Adair was like the soothsayer, reminding us of conscience and ethics, and the sacrifice of both and the relentless search for a second chance.<br />I'm still a fan. A little romance never hurt anyone. You critics, lighten up. His best effort? No. An excellent read?

Michael Havelock watches his lover Jenna Karats murdered off the coast of Costa Brava. He is in agony. We learn so much about her as his lover, his friend, and his partner in the first couple of dozen pages. We learn about their likes, their time together, why he loved her and why she loved him - and she's dead.<br />Thus begins Ludlum's \\"Parsifal Mosaic,\\" the best spy novel/ romance I have ever read. I reread it again after Francine Matthews' \\"The Cutout,\\" just to remind myself about lovers and murderers and the evil empire and the Darth Vaders and the KGB and the CIA and all the rest of the symbols of oppression that kept Jenna and Michael from being together.<br />The problem with Cutout is that I learned so much about the cities of Berlin, Budapest, Prague and others that I thought I was reading the New York Times' Sunday Travel Section. But I didn't know much about Caroline and Eric. I mean she seemed to dig him, but who knows why? Did they sleep together, wake up, eat bagels and lox in bed and then sleep together some more? Did the go to the Louvre? Did they get lost on the Montreal subway system? Did he play baseball in high school? Did he dig Jimi Hendrix or Eric Clapton? Was he her one and only? Could she ever be with another person after he died? Had she waited the 2 1/2 years after his death for . . . what?<br />See, some characters can be one dimensional, just not the lead ones. I think you have to have a tree upon which to hang the ornaments. I knew a little about her, a little less about him, and nothing about them.<br />Did she love him? Why? He seemed like a real knucklehead. He seemed selfish, self centered, biased, out for himself, reclusive and secretive. And those were his good points. She was with him for ten years! Surely there was some basis for their relationship. Matthews just doesn't tell us what it is. Maybe she was into boredom and a near abusive (certainly emotionally) relationship.<br />And for her, the nom de plume \\"Mad Dog.\\" What was that all about? Sorry. I found it tedious. Obviously, there's a talent here for descriptions because the cities are either interesting or lovely or both. Too bad it wasn't a travelogue.<br />I'll read Matthews again but this one was hollow.that all about? Sorry. I found it tedious.

I thought I was embarking upon a Burger King of a novel and instead I found myself at a Five Star restaurant. Well, Four Stars. The characters are both interesting and magnetic. Moral conflicts arise that remain unresolved, always a believable result. Kirsten Lord doesn't have all the answers, but she has enough of them to recognize that if she doesn't address something in her past where she \\"went along to get along,\\" whether she survives the Witness Security Program or not won't make a difference because she would have become 'a witness' [was this intentional? Brilliant if it was] to her own moral decay.<br />Carl Luppo is one of the best supporting characters I have ever read. Like Kirsten, I'm not sure I like him but I would certainly like him on my side. Carl would always have my back.<br />The daughter is a loving, intelligent, pain in the you know what, just like real 9-year olds.<br />Wonderful moral confusion, observable growth and fascinating characters. Good dialogue. Very good book.	2002-02-02

He reminds me of Lehane, who burst upon on the scene with rare economy and language, only to seemingly run out of ideas and characters. We keep rooting for a comeback and hoping that fate doesn't happen to other favorites.<br />But with Flinch, the brilliant, millionaire doctor and his twin brother, the underworld haunted, World Wrestling Federation attendee, the friend of criminals, righter of the wake of evil psychos, just didn't work for me. I tried, Bob, really I did. The dialogue is crisp and funny and witty, as long as you could suspend knowledge of who was the speaking. But after Heartbreaker, an extraordinary effort, this was going-through-the-motions-like. And in Heartbreaker, I never saw the ending coming. Last three pages . . . knocked me out. In Flinch I saw it coming in the first three pages. And clairvoyant, I ain't.<br />One last point. I'm really getting tired of the serial killer \\"because I am a confused genius having fun\\" motif. Have we used that one enough? I think there's a legion of really excellent auhors who never wrote a serial killer plot: Chandler, Parker, Crumley, Burke all come to mind. It's tedious. It borders on offensive. I'll read Ferrigno again, and probably again. This one, in the words of Luca Brazi, 'sleeps with the fishes.'	2002-02-02

His prose is tight; his characters are multi dimensional and speak in compressed, vivid dialogue. When Charley Burke asks Ben Tyler, having just been released from the Arizona State Prison at Rosemary, Arizona in 1898, if he learned anything following his incarceration for bank robbery and the ensuing, relentless pursuit of the posse, Ben tells him &quot;Yes. Next time I need more fresh horses.&quot;<br />Charley, Ben, the lovely Amelia, her evil keeper, the Spanish captors and the homeric insurrectionists (ocassionally they swap moralities), all coalesce on the island of Cuba a few days after the USS Maine is blown up in the harbor.<br />This is Leanord at his best: Colorfully, flawed characters, women who love hard, oftentimes for the wrong man, evildoers with streaks of decency, downtrodden individuals with streaks of evil, fabulous booty that's chased, followed, captured, lost,  gained, lost again, regained, and the type of dialogue that from time to time makes you put the book down, repeat the line to yourself, and smile.<br />Just like Hammet, Chandler, DeMille, and Parker, you have to first like Leonard. If you do, this is a master at the heighth of his craft. Enjoy.	2001-11-10

Apparently living a contented, normal life as a Boeing 737 pilot, his wife is killed in a car accident. Then his only child Melinda, aged 11, is kidnapped, tortured, raped, photographed in the midst of all of this horror, and killed. Ken Wolfe snaps.<br />He contributes to the capture of the pedophile and then is forced to stand back in shock as the defendant is released on a &quot;technicality.&quot;<br />The anonymous phone call that led the police to complete a  fruitful search, now becomes truly anonymous. The person the police detective swears called him, now denies the call. Wolfe and the police believe that man to have been the then US Attorney for the State of Connecticut. Rudy Bostich, the US Attorney and the &quot;voice&quot; the detective recognized on the other end of the &quot;tip,&quot; disavows any knowledge of the defendant or the crime. Hence the &quot;fruit of the poisoned tree&quot; defense is actuated and all of the evidence of the defendant's complicity is lost.<br />Two years later, unable to become an assassin, Wolfe boards one of his company's 737's where he is a left seat 4 striper only to find that Rudy Bostich, now a future Attorney General, is seated in First Class. Having failed at using normal means to get both attention and justice for his little girl, and knowing that his life is over without her, Wolfe hijacks his own passenger airplane to draw national attention and coerce Bostich to &quot;confess.&quot; Sounds really, really unbelievable?<br />I have two problems with this book. Dick Francis, one of England's most notable steeplechase jockeys, became an excellent and prodigious author after his career was over. But his books only &quot;relate&quot; to races. They are about the friends of jockeys. They are about GP veterinarians, about the tranportation of horses, they are about detectives investigating crimes at races. They're all about horses and horse people, but only peripherally.<br />However Captain Nance seems forced to place the center of attention in the left hand seat. Everything revolves around the pilot. Female characters are one dimensional and always &quot;fall&quot; for the Captain. This belittles Captian Nance, because he's such a good story teller. There's a lot of interesting things that go on around an airport. A lot of them aren't in the cockpit.<br />The other problem is the pedophilia angle. Bad move. Most people are disgusted by that and Captain Wolfe's potential medieval retribution offers little solace for the reader who is frankly turned off by that angle. I would read Nance again.

I've read some of them twice. I read Rachel Wallace three times. Spenser is Homeric. If I were a kid, in a common sense sort of way, he's who I would like to aspire to be. At least to have a code like him. Loyal. Smart. Fair. Relentless. Reminding us, we must never be cowards in the face of ignorance.<br />His relationship with Hawk is perfect. It chastises us for racial hesitation, reminds us of the sanctity of loyalty, loving Susan in different ways. Colorless, gender less, ageless, lacking homophobia, frequently inspiring us that while convention is important, three people can love each other in their own fashion. And finally it tells us that occasionally, the bad guys need an exceptionally painful beating. And Spenser and Hawk are up to it. Except. . . .<br />Let's do the math. Spenser was a Corporal in Desert Storm? No. Vietnam? No. Korea. 1952. And Spenser and Hawk fought professionally. Let's see. Spenser fought Tyson? No. He fought Larry Holmes? No. Spenser fought Archie Moore. So let's see. Subtract the 3, carry the 6, allow an error of, hmmmmm. Holy Beacon Street. Great Jamaica Plain. Good Charles River. Bloody Fenway Park. Is Spenser over 70?<br />So Parker, who is a brilliant author with a near rabid cult following, brings us Jesse Stone. And while Spenser was a man for all seasons in the amoral 70's, Jesse Stone is introspective. Where Spenser quoted Coleridge and Keats, Jesse acknowledges picking up a writer and suspected killer's 465 page recent novel, 'that he might never have read 465 pages in his life.' While Spenser lives a lyric out of Stephen Stills, &quot;those who are on the road must have a code that you can live by,&quot; Stone struggles with his lost youth in the Dodger farm system. That, and the fact that he's a drunk.<br />No, seriously. Get away from all of that controlled drinking rationalization that Parker weaves.  Jesse's a drunk. Just a regular garden variety drunk. Angst has got nothing to do with it. Cause is not a reason, it's a mantra drunks quote to explain their self destruction and a willingness to take all around them with them. In the words of Hawk mocking his best friend, &quot;ain't no such thang.&quot; Oh yeah. And Stone's on again off again wife sleeps with other men. And it tears him up into little pieces. But he keeps on loving her, getting drunk, losing jobs, and telling every beautiful woman he meets that as soon as Jenn stops sleeping around, he's out of here. Hmmmmm.<br />This is a hard guy to admire. It's like your Uncle Bob. Come on Bob, get it together, you want to say. Go to a meeting. Move. Find a new partner. Take classes. Take a trip. Learn how to macrame. One thing you don't want is Uncle Bob showing up at the kids' sleep over with half a quart of Dewars in him and a .38 Colt in a holster on his hip. And you probably don't want him at a crime scene, either.<br />So I'm sorry Professor Parker, I'm getting tired of Jesse. I liked the first three novels but he's like your best friend whose wife left him 7 years ago. You're willing to take one last chance at talking him into getting over it. The Moving Finger Writes. The clock is ticking. Get a life.<br />And that's what you got for me, Jesse. You got one more chance.gst has got nothing to do with it.
