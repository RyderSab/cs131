There are 38 photographs of artifact collections that were drawn from the Smithsonian and New York's American Museum of Natural History.  The Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian, opening 21-26 September 2004, will certainly allow more detailed study.  This book's 249 pages give a general anthropologic overview that can be used as a guide for further research. <br /> <br />Editor Colin F. Taylor, the book's technical consultant, is the curator of North American ethnology for the Smithsonian.  His involvement allowed publication of objects and photographs that just possibly have been included in the new National Museum of the American Indian.  In many ways, this book would be excellent to review prior to visiting the new museum. <br /> <br />The book is divided into nine geographic areas of North America then is further divided into tribes from that area, informing us about linguistics, ethnic styles of clothing and embellishment, and whether the tribe relied upon hunting and gathering or had an established agrarian culture. <br /> <br />Many old photographs are sprinkled throughout the book to show how Native Americans dressed before they were absorbed into non-native culture.  Both the index and the bibliography are thorough -- a very beautiful book to add to your collection. <br />	2004-09-28

The montage incorporates a religious picture, jeweled ornaments, and a hanging candleholder which, in a former life, was a coffee urn lid.  Binky provides tips on how to bargain at estate and garage sales, such as paying in cash or using inclement weather to find a desperate seller.   <br /> <br />Binky has a super idea for using those one or two beads you have leftover from other projects -- wire them together for a beaded curtain.  She suggests that you look around for inspiration.  On a recent shopping trip, I saw some very expensive beaded and embellished pillows.  With some exotic fabric scraps, beads, and old brooches gathered from a rummage sale, you could quickly and easily make a similar project without spending much money. <br /> <br />She includes a gallery of the work of others who use found objects.  Jo Packham and Chapelle Designers make holiday ornaments.  Mary Jo Hiney's work has a distinctly Victorian influence.  If you are a pack-rat, collecting bottle caps or used gift-wrap, this book will give you inspiration for their use. <br />	2004-09-28

In it, you'll learn to recognize tribal jewelry styles and techniques.  Although the first native American to learn silversmithing is not known, it appears to have begun among the Navajo in the 1850s, then was passed to the Zuni and Hopi.    When the railroads opened the Wild West, silverwork began to respond not just to the tastes of the silversmiths themselves, but to the travelers looking for a souvenir of their encounter with the exotic Southwest inhabitants.    The Navajo developed their style of setting large stones into cast, hammered, and stamped silver.  The Zuni made clusterwork their forte, setting small turquoise stones in silver, called petitpoint and needlepoint.  You'll learn the differences among mosaic, channel, and overlay inlays, about Pueblo fetish, and Santo Domingo heishi.  The book shows both old and modern jewelry styles and is pocket-sized for easy reference when shopping.	2004-09-24

Realizing that the diamonds will be around long after she's gone, Liz cleverly states that she's only \\"borrowing\\" them for awhile.  The jewelry is pictured actual size unless otherwise stated, giving an up-close and personal picture of, not only the jewelry but, the owner.  Both Liz and the jewels are dazzlers.    Pictured here are the jewels given to Liz by her husbands, Michael Jackson, or purchased by her just because she wanted them in her collection.  Liz gives the story behind where and how she obtained each piece and many of the stories are hilarious.  For example, she tells about the time her dog ate the historically important \\"La Peregrina,\\" a huge pearl with a royal history; Prince Philip II had given it to Mary Tudor as an engagement present.  Fortunately, the pearl was rescued from the dog undamaged.    You'll really enjoy this book if you're the type who only has a few hours to spend in Washington DC and decide to use that precious time to visit the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History gem collection.	2004-09-23

This exposition showed how modern technology could be fused with the arts, bringing German bauhaus design to America's attention.     <br /> <br />The prior year, 1926, saw the release of the silent film \\"Metropolis,\\" Fritz Lang's anxious vision of a world demanding conformity in which \\"the masses\\" are controlled by machines and their owners.  This film's art direction makes use of many art deco design elements which find their way into mainstream costume jewelry design.  Geometric shapes and simplicity dominate costume jewelry in which new, inexpensive materials, such as bakelite and corolite could be incorporated, adding translucent and opaque color. <br /> <br />Fashion jewelry components in the 1930's were manufactured primarily in Bohemia so, when Jewish owners lost their factories in 1938, art deco costume jewelry also vanished from the fashion scene.  This book gathers -- and preserves in photographs -- much of art deco jewelry's beauty within its pages.    <br />	2004-09-21

A piece of kuba cloth stimulates the creation of her \\"Spirit of Africa\\" neckpiece.  Compared to Helen's earlier book, this book's collar designs are a bit more ethnic. <br /> <br />Helen incorporates Tory Hughes's faux stones made from polymer clay, taking advantage of the clay's lighter weight to prevent neck strain in what might be uncomfortable if real stones were used. <br /> <br />The set-up of the book may seem backwards, at first view, because a gallery of completed collars are shown one after the other, followed by technique and design elements.  Seeing page after page of gorgeous weavings will make you say, \\"I want to learn how to do this!\\"  After you make this decision, here are lessons on focal point, color, texture, rhythm, balance and scale. <br /> <br />Helen's designs cannot be copied stitch-for-stitch nor are they meant to be.  What she teaches you is a general off-loom weaving technique and encourages you to use the technique in whatever direction you choose it to go.  I took a class from her several years ago and she taught us how to set up the pins and warp, then turned us loose.  The hardest part of the class was the preparation -- choosing the thread, ribbon, and yarn for the weft and the elements to incorporate into the weaving.    <br /> <br />	2004-09-21

His thorough textbook documents not only native American beadwork techniques, but the tedious methods of leather preparation that are necessary prior to beading. <br /> <br />A San Antonio local artisan, Ken Yanez, is familiar with this process of scraping, lacing and brain-tanning leather.  Ken befriended a native American while in the Marines and accompanied him home to the reservation during military leaves.  There, an elder showed Ken some magnificent, old beadwork.  Ken was surprised to learn that the tribal youth showed little interest, including his friend.  Although Ken doesn't have sufficient native American ancestry to qualify for tribal membership, he made a personal commitment to learn these techniques.  Ken's projects are authentically produced but cannot be labeled as \\"Indian made.\\"      <br /> <br />Why don't tribal youth show more interest in native American craft?  Preparation for beading in the native American tradition, such as brain-tanning of hides, is labor intensive, although the results are buttery-soft, making the leather pliable for decorative beading and quilling.  Because of the work and time involved, few of today's tribal youth want to perpetuate the craft.  \\"Time\\" has become \\"money,\\" so if there is interest in doing crafts in the classical tradition, it's to make some money.  Ken will attest to the amount of time it took to make a cradle board for his son.  He certainly couldn't sell it for a price to equal the months that he put into the project. <br /> <br />To offset the lack of interest in fine craft, author Joel Monture has captured the steps needed to recreate the obvious beauty inherent in native American beadwork.  The book features 43 color plates of beadwork, including the styles of many North American tribes.  <br /> <br />In one respect, Joel is preserving an anthropological record of the personal ornamentation used by various tribes by showing us the differences and similarities of style.   To lose these tribal identifiers results in cultural homogeny and a disconnect with our human history.  Joel's sense of history has led him to capture these artistic techniques before they are lost.    <br />	2004-09-17

We are currently going through an Arts and Crafts revival with the available abundance of Mission and Prairie furniture knock-offs.      We learn from this book that the current revival is limited to the style of New Yorker Gustav Stickley who, in 1892, was inspired by the English designers William Morris and John Ruskin.  Stickley favored simple linear lines in his furniture.  The Arts and Crafts movement had many variations, evolving from a backlash against the rise of industry and mass-production.  The movement emphasized pride in fine handcrafting and workmanship, attention to detail, and rejection of Victorian stylings having little artistic integrity.    As applied to jewelry, the Arts and Crafts movement took on different interpretations depending upon the designer's location.  In France, some jewelry tended toward the grotesque.  Following a different muse, Lalique's jewelery was themed on nature, such as insects and flowers.      In Sweden, Georg Jensen's silver jewelry sought classic new shapes.  In the US, Tiffany used multi-hued glass in his jewelry designs.  In Ireland, there was a Celtic revival in jewelry.  Ancient Celtic designs such as swirling, swerving, symmetrical knots were Arts and Crafts \\"naturals.\\"    Precious stones used in Arts and Crafts jewelry include gold, enamel, opal, amethyst, diamond, garnet, and pearl, particularly baroque pearls.     If you are interested in the Arts and Crafts movement, this book will give you not only an idea of how the design was applied to jewelry but also to architecture, furniture and accessories, and clothing.	2004-09-16

First, the collector of netsukes will find that they are expensive.  Second, the purpose of a netsuke is to fasten an \\"inro,\\" or case holding valuables, to an obi or belt.  \\"Ne\\" translates as \\"root\\" and \\"tsuke\\" translates as \\"to fasten.\\"  An inro's cords are held tightly by an \\"ojime,\\" or bead, to keep it closed and the netsuke keeps the inro from falling off of the wearer. <br /> <br />The highly-detailed photographs of netsukes are in harmony with the scenery and objects surrounding them, so lusciously artistic that you may consider framing them.  <br /> <br />HIH Prince Norihito of Takamado, who wrote this book's foreward, says he looks for \\"warmth, wit, and a certain twist\\" in his own netsuke collection.  To fully appreciate a netsuke, \\"hold it, feel it, and examine it closely in one's hand.\\" <br /> <br />Netsuke figures have stories associated with them.  Many figures are puns in which the same word may have several meanings.  For example, monkey is \\"saru\\" which is pronounced the same as \\"to leave,\\" so it would be unlucky to marry in a monkey year. <br /> <br />If you are not familiar with Asian astrology, this book will teach you much about the associated legends.  One tale that fascinated me was about Daruma, the 28th patriarch of Zen Buddhism.  Daruma meditated for 9 years, sitting so long that his legs lost their strength.  My sister, who lived in Japan for many years, sent me a wooden Daruma doll with two blank eyes.  When you knock over the Daruma doll, it pops back upright, reflecting an undaunted spirit.  Here's what you are supposed to do with a Daruma doll: you color one eye to make a prayer, then you color the other one when the prayer is answered. <br /> <br />You'll learn much about  Japanese life and legend from studying these tiny netsukes -- and Symmes provides us with a  fun way to learn. <br />	2004-09-16

The Beader's Companion (Interweave Press) is a far better book for \\"complete beading techniques.\\"  For working with seed beads, though, this book does provide instructions that are fairly easy to follow. <br /> <br />Jane allots a chapter for each technique: loomwork and stitches including square, brick and ladder, peyote, netting, herringbone, right-angle weave, and knitting. <br /> <br />The 30 projects provided may scare or discourage a beginner.  For many seed bead projects to have a successful outcome, much depends upon consistent thread tension.  Beginners must practice thread tension on simpler projects than Jane gives us, although her suggested sampler gives some practice.  The projects are absolutely stunning, so this book would be the cat's pajamas for someone already-skilled in working with seed beads who is looking for a challenge. <br /> <br />Interspersed with the diagrams and text are examples of finished work, both antique and new, serving to inspire the bead artist.  Blank pages that can be copied for graphing a design in various bead stitches are a handy addition. <br />	2004-09-16

As is true in many collector books, the price guide is not in the back of this book.  Instead, a price range is handily placed by each item's photograph, so no flipping to and from the back of the book is required.    The jewelry is sorted by maker, accompanied by a bit of history and general recognition characteristics.  In case you forget the designer as you move through the book, the name is in a blue bar at the top of the page.  You may not see the exact piece of jewelry you are trying to locate, but you will learn how to recognize a designer's general style.    The photography is do-it-yourself; Sparkles's husband, Kenneth A. Brown assisted in this department.  Although a few of the photos are a bit out-of-focus, they are sufficiently clear to make out the main details.      The book is divided into general categories, such as: \\"designing men, designing women, disciples of Haskell, Hollywood stars, manufacturers, metalcraft, and unattributed pieces.\\"      In order to determine the age of a piece, Sparkle tells us to look at the soldering, the catch, magazine advertisements and art or fashion trends of various periods.  She gives us tips on care, restoration and storage of our costume jewelry.  To my surprise, I learned that the value of a brooch that I bought at a thrift shop, just because I thought it looked pretty, is valued at about $90 (and I surely paid nowhere near that price).  I'm certainly glad my brooch's consignor hadn't looked at this book.  You might find that you've got a surprise treasure, too!	2004-09-16

The pictures of personal ornamentation in this book will test how you define `jewelry.'  Simplicity is thematic, giving the viewer an impression of movement in the swoops and curves shaping each piece.

Try some of Jeanette's ideas.	2003-04-08

Instead, Mary shows you how to use easily-found materials to make some fabulous beads.  Mary recommends candy foil because it can be formed into shapes and is light and colorful.  Other materials she explores are clay, polymer clay, felt, natural materials, aromatics, plastic, and embroidery.  Seeds and shells are pierced to make beads.  Paper can be used to make papier-mch' beads or can be cut into strips and rolled around a toothpick and glued to make a bead.  Mary's roses made from colored tissue paper and wallpaper paste are lovely -- I'll use this technique to decorate holiday gifts.  Raid your spice rack to make aromatic beads from anise, cloves, cinnamon bark, cardamom pods, and whole nutmegs.  For Valentine's Day, sending velvet hearts decorated with embroidery would be more fun than a greeting card.  Mary's book will send your imagination soaring.	2003-04-08

If the instructional pictures are good enough, it doesn't really matter in what language the script is.  Beadwork that I've found overseas reflects the local culture, being very different in style than beadwork in the US.  Japanese style is evident in Matsuko's book.  Like Ikebana, the Japanese art of arranging flowers, beadwork in Japan reflects simplicity in its use of line, size, shape, and space.  Starting with the book's cover, you will see the influence of these sparse design elements in Matsuko's beadwork jewelry.  Owner of Hiroo Bead Bazaar in Tokyo, Matsuko gives us almost fifty projects, including rings, lariats, chokers, brooches, earrings and hair ornaments.  The beautiful finished projects are in the front of the book and the easy-to-follow instructions are in the back.	2003-04-08

You'll say, \\"Wow!  How can I make these gorgeous little necklace purses?\\"  Author Enid Taylor shows you how.  Bead stitching is pretty much the same from book to book, offering the same techniques shown here: brick, square, peyote, and netting stitches.  This book is special because Enid shows you how those stitches combine to make a fabulous purse.  Enid, a home economics teacher for 24 years, started a craft studio in 1982, so there's lots of teaching experience behind her book.  Although her craft studio's focus was on lacemaking, spinning, and needlework, her expertise in beading shines through.  Not only are there many techniques shown for the body of the purses, but there are multiple ways shown to make the neckchains and fanciful decorative finishes.  If your aim is to concentrate your efforts on amulet necklaces, this is the book for you!	2003-04-04

And, like potato chips, you can't have just one.  Unlike most bead books, this one does not start with tools needed or techniques.  Linda starts with the elements of design, important to all art.  You need to know about line, shape, texture, color, and creating a focal point before learning how to make a piece of art.  Linda does not neglect techniques, leading you through wire work, bead stringing, beading on a ground, woven beadwork, and the use of polymer clay.  To inspire, she includes a 12-page gallery and designer notes.

Like at Topkapi, this Mughal exhibit features the dazzling glitter of thousands of gemstones set in gold, overwhelming me to the point of gaping at each item.  I spent so much time studying the items themselves that I took scant notice of the exhibit's cards.  This book provides the leisure to study the story behind the artistry.  Little wonder that metal and gemstone workers were prized by Mughal rulers who enjoyed lavish gift exchanges.

The book is one of a series funded by the Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict.  In this formal setting, the two authors have collaborated on peace-making and peace-keeping policies.<br />Together, Feldman and Toukan write the opening chapter.  First, they define the Middle East as all nations west to Morocco, east to Iran, north to Syria, and south to Yemen.  This area contains five percent of the world's population, sixty percent of the world's known oil reserves, and thirty percent of the world's arms imports.  The area is plagued with a shortage of water and with refugee problems.  Despite deep hostilities between Arabs and Israelis that have their roots in ancient history, there are real attempts at peacemaking between Israel and Palestine, Israel and Jordan, and Israel and Egypt.  The Arms Control and Regional Security (ACRS) working group, with members from Israel, Palestine and thirteen other Middle Eastern nations, has been negotiating to reduce suspicion and promote dialogue.  <br />The early 1990's brought drastic changes to the Middle East.  First, there was the end of the Cold War, changing attitudes between the former USSR and the US.  Soviet Jews were permitted to emigrate to Israel, bringing their talents and skills.  <br />Second, the Gulf War changed attitudes of the Arab countries toward each other.  Where they had forsworn to defend each other from a common enemy, they had not reckoned that the challenge would come from within when Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990.  When the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) leader Yasir Arafat supported Iraq's action, the PLO gained the ire of their Arab allies.  In spite of such obvious disagreement, peace negotiations began in 1992 andhave continued even after unsettling incidents such as the murder of Yitzhak Rabin in 1995 and acts of Islamic terrorism.<br />Toukan counters Feldman's viewpoint with statistics from Israel's wars of 1948, 1956, 1968-70 and 1973, all of which involved their territorial expansion.  The Arab world views Israel as dangerously aggressive and expansionist.<br />In the end, Feldman and Toukan come together to summarize the difficulties that negotiations bring.  At the same time, they recognize that continuing negotiations are necessary for the mutual survival of Israel and the Arab countries.  They would prefer that Syria, Lebanon and Iran be involved in ACRS talks.  Actions have been accomplished to remove media attention away from the talks, so that they may freely continue without public scrutiny and pressure.  Unfortunately, the lack of media attention has also kept the public ignorant about successful progress in the talks.  One of the more unusual agreements made at ACRS talks was to revise school textbooks to remove myths and built-in prejudices.  This will certainly help to reduce the paranoia.<br />An index of abbreviations used in the book is included, a glossary, and a thorough index.  The book lacks a map of the Middle East.  I referred often to the abbreviation index and glossary, and would have found a map just as handy.  While reading about disturbing, current Middle Eastern events in the newspaper, it is comforting to know that the negotiations described in Bridging the Gap still continue.	2001-02-13

Robert Allison packs the book with romance, adventure, and action.  Among his heroes are Steven Decatur and James Riley, and  others of this fascinating period of United States history.  Allison writes with a wry sense of humor, bringing history alive.  The Barbary pirates, the stuff of legends and fairy tales, were real.  Allison demystifies the origin of the words to the Marine song: \\"to the shores of Tripoli.\\"<br />  Author Robert Allison's accounts are so vivid, you can almost imagine a movie script in progress.  The last chapter of The Crescent Obscured is another extraordinary story, that of James Riley, captain of the Commerce, and his crew.  Shipwrecked in the Mediterranean near the Spanish Sahara, James Riley endured two years of captivity, remaining all the while concerned about his crew and trusting Providence for their deliverance.  Riley wrote a book about his experiences, called Travels and Sufferings: An Authentic Narrative of the Loss of the American Brig Commerce, Wrecked on the Western Coast of Africa in the Month of August 1815.  Not only did Riley recite the events of the captivity in his book, but also made references to the state of slavery.  Riley's book was one of six that Abraham Lincoln claimed most influenced him.<br />The Crescent Obscured is history made fun to read.  Robert Allison teaches us what influence the Muslim world had on the infant nation.  We learn that there certainly was much more than we might have expected before reading Allison's wonderful book.	2001-02-13

Paul Bailey presents a concise and readable analysis of the events in Japan after World War II.  He includes a smattering of 19th and early 20th century Japanese history that led to Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor and enumerates the terrible loss of life caused by the war.  <br />Paul Bailey uses the changing faces in the office of prime minister to characterize Japan's internal and external turbulence.  Bailey elaborates in great detail about the public shifts in attitude and activism based upon the directions the prime minister in office chose to go.<br />Paul Bailey concludes that Japan's postwar period is not over because there are too many unresolved feelings about the war that affect the way Japan views the world.  The postwar period may have ended at Hirohito's death in January 1989, but old hostilities and feelings resurfaced at the 50th anniversary ceremonies marking the atomic bombings and the surrender.  Bailey's book includes a handy outline chronology and a map at the beginning of the book.  He suggests further readings, includes an extensive bibliography, translation glossary, and a detailed index.  Postwar Japan is excellent reading for those who want to study how sweeping lifestyle, economic and cultural changes in a country can be effected by a single person - General MacArthur.  Readers will learn how those changes affect the long-term relationship between the victor and the defeated.	2001-02-13

In addition to the editor James Boyce, contributing authors are Carlos Acevedo, Deborah Barry, Michael Conroy, Colin Danby, Manuel Pastor, Jr., Eva Paus, Herman Rosa, Alexander Segovia, and Elisabeth Wood.  <br />El Salvador is located in western Central America.  The nation suffered through twelve years of civil war (1980-1992) that ended in stalemate.  With the help of the United Nations, peace was declared in January 1992.  The Chapultepec Accords spelled out the conditions of peace.  They included provisions for the redistribution of property, a legal system to enforce property rights and contracts, and defined state obligations to provide economic tasks unfulfilled by the private sector.  Although the intent was to link the peace process with economic policy, the new government did not fully support what was visualized.  The peace process was in the hands of the United Nations, while the economic policy was in the hands of the World Bank, The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the InterAmerican Development Bank (IDB).  The peace process was not tightly bound to economic policy.<br />According to Alexander Segovia, twenty percent of the population emigrated during the twelve-year war, mostly to the United States, and over 75,000 lives were lost.  In 1986, an earthquake hit the capital of San Salvador, killing 1,200 people and leaving 300,000 homeless.<br />Carlos Acevedo outlines the history of El Salvador's inequality of land ownership and wealth in El Salvador.  The peasant farmer of El Salvador has had a rocky time since 1882 when the government abolished communal property.  Up until that time, farmers had collectively planted the land with a wide variety of subsistence crops.  High demand for coffee became the driving force for establishing private ownership.  El Salvador's powerful elite swiftly took control of the land, resulting in the most inequitable pattern of land distribution in the world.  Fourteen families controlled the vast majority of arable land that constituted 40 percent of El Salvador's total land area.  In 1889, a rural police force was established to enforce the policies of the landowners.  To grasp the enormity of the power of the coffee growers, in 1890, coffee constituted 56 percent of El Salvador's exports.  By 1931, this grew to 96 percent of all exports from El Salvador.  <br />Manuel Pastor, Jr. and Michael Conroy note that El Salvador is not alone in the population's reaction to inequality in resource (land and wealth) distribution.  In other Latin American countries, when distribution pressures build, the result has been flight: people take their capital and/or themselves abroad, go into the hills to wage armed revolution, or adopt long-term radical economic policies that cannot work.  This is precisely what occurred in El Salvador.<br />James Boyce provides the excellent introduction and final summary to this book in his straightforward style.  The theme he wants you to follow throughout the book is that \\"unless the peace process is allowed to shape economic policy, both will fail.\\"  Peace rests upon social equality in income and wealth, investment in human natural and physical capital through education and environmental protection, and democratization to achieve balance in the distribution of power.  The book's message is one of hope for El Salvador, but only if the government puts full throttle toward making social equality a reality and not merely words in a peace accord.	2001-02-13

I enjoyed applying what Nigel Harris says about immigration to events in my daily life and to debates appearing in San Antonio's media.<br />You cannot deny that there are recent immigrants from Mexico when you see the Mexican license plates on cars on San Antonio's highways.  Some Mexicans, like my next-door neighbor, own property.  Strange to me, my neighbor visits his San Antonio home about once a year for only a few days.  While I struggle to pay a mortgage, he paid cash for his home.  A Realtor explained to me that many wealthy Mexicans purchase real estate because of the peso's instability when weighed against the relative stability of the US real estate market.  <br />Was the fellow who installed marble on my kitchen floor an illegal Mexican immigrant?  I don't know, but he did a crackerjack job and his price was competitive.  Where do I go to get my family's prescription drugs?  To Mexico, because in Mexico I can buy for five dollars what will cost me $50 at the drug store two miles away from my home.  My actions are echoed as the basic premise of Nigel Harris's book.  The immigration question is basically one of supply and demand.  As soon as Christopher Columbus set foot in the New World, there was a call for immigrants to come from the Old World.  They came first to conquer, then to settle.  Settlement was, and is, power.<br />The trepidation about the closing of Kelly Air Force Base and the reopening of its facilities to private industry is tied to the existence of polluting maquiladoras operating in Mexico.  In Mexico, the industries are free from scrutiny of the US Environmental Protection Agency.  Why would a manufacturer want to move to Kelly, when cheaper labor and less regulation exist only two hours further south?  A recent article in the San Antonio Express News talked about the amount of pollution in the air at Big Bend NationalPark; sulfur dioxide and other pollutants from Mexican factories are affecting the people who live in Alpine, Texas.  A Mexican worker who makes car parts spoke at a stockholders' meeting about the 90 cents per hour Mexican wage versus Detroit's union scale.  When visiting Aguascalientes in Mexico a few years ago, I saw many Japanese people in the mercado.  Curious, I asked about their presence and was told they produced automobile parts there.<br />Harris addresses all aspects of immigration in a tidy, organized fashion.  He contrasts voluntary immigration with the status of involuntary refugee.    Harris's only weakness is his view of national sovereignty.  He thinks that government regulation of immigration is a major inconvenience to free labor force movement.  Economic growth occurs, as Harris states, because of legal and illegal immigration.  If governments stand in the way of immigration, they are obstructing economic growth.  Harris would like to see nations behave more like large corporations, rather than as restrictive governments. <br />The current US debate about immigration has to do with two aspects of the USA.  First, US citizenry expects inhabitants to integrate into US society - to naturalize.  This fosters individual cooperation rather than separatism.  Citizens are supposed to celebrate their ethnicity, not to segregate themselves because of it.  Second, citizens view individual income tax collection like membership dues, as if the US government were a vast mutual benefit cooperative.  The US government and its citizenry are certainly concerned about immigration, especially if immigrants do not pay taxes, their dues, yet are provided with government services.  The US is a participatory democracy; whether or not a US citizen chooses to vote does not make it less so.  Government provides infrastructure, such as subsidies for roads, to increase the economic benefit to its people.  Citizens have a right to expect that all those who use the infrastructure pay their dues.<br />We truly live in a global economy.  Business, family, communications and transportation networks are making our world smaller.  Immigration may eventually level the playing field, or it may cause greater international tensions, or both.  Reading this book will give you greater insight into the effect of immigration on the global economy.	2001-02-13

Authors of the various chapters are university-level scholars and teachers of history, political science, sociology, religion, and African studies.  The subjects covered are African history, politics, national economies, international relations, population growth and urbanization, the environment, familial structures, women's effect in society, religion, and literature.  There is an entire chapter devoted to South Africa.<br />This book contains many helpful references.  Full page maps are near the beginning of the book, showing major physical features, the ITCZ and vegetation zones, natural resources compared to railroads and navigable rivers, early states and empires, colonies in 1914, and current countries and their capitals.  I needed to refer to them often enough that I put a paperclip on the pages.  Table 5.1 is a current export chart.  Each chapter ends in a lengthy bibliography for further study.  At the end of the book, acronyms are defined and there is a thorough glossary to which I referred many times.  Basic Political Data is the third appendix.  Each country is traced from independence to the present day in terms of its leaders.  <br />Although the book suffers from sweeping generalizations, many times these are acknowledged by the authors.  There are too few examples of these generalizations for my own taste.  I personally prefer more \\"real people\\" stories to demonstrate points being made.  This does not detract from the excellence of this intended introductory textbook for college-level African studies courses.  <br />The last chapter of the book leaves the reader on the upbeat.  There is hope for Africa in the current generation of young, educated middle and upper class men and women.  They are seeing a bright future for Africa with hope in place of despair.  Autocrats are being replaced with democratic leaders.  Small businesses areon the rise; this is always a healthy sign in an economy.  Health services and public education have increased since independence.  The book closes with the observation that it will take a world partnership with Africa to make things work to neutralize the long term effects of exploitation of the African continent.	2001-02-13

Author James C. McCann uses his thorough research into archival evidence and current oral history to demonstrate the persistence of these farming methods to the present time.  McCann's easy writing style takes farmers' narrative tales and translates them into social science language.<br />McCann clearly shows how Ethiopian farmers have been moved, in this century, from self-reliance to dependence upon political whims.  Farmers now rely upon the state to provide seed and fertilizer, and so are forced into growing crops from those seeds, whether the environmental conditions cooperate or not. <br />McCann's writing style holds the reader's interest because he includes so many first person narratives and examples to illustrate his points.  More detailed maps that show locations of old and new trade and market centers would be appreciated.  McCann often talks about these changes, so maps could have acted to clarify the text if he had placed them near to the specific locations under discussion.  His book is meticulously researched.  This book is an excellent introduction to the general interaction of government and agriculture and its specific interplay in Ethiopia.	2001-02-13

Women with dots on their foreheads wearing flowing, silken saris?  Ravi Shankar playing strange sounding melodies on the sitar?  Beatle George Harrison sitting in the yoga lotus position in deep meditation while patchouli incense wafts through the air?  Gentle Mother Teresa ministering to the poor?  The language of love in the Kamasutra?  Brahman cattle wandering the streets, free from facing the slaughterhouse?  India paints a peaceful picture in your mind.  In truth, the cattle are treated more humanely than the majority of people in India.<br />A caste elite dominates India, totally monopolizing the nation's power and wealth.  Members of the highest caste, the Brahmin caste, use their power to suppress dissent from those who are not members of their caste.  We learn from incidents cited in this book that their suppression has included the use of unspeakable torture, racially based and religiously based exclusion from educational and economic opportunities, and an appalling inhumanity towards non-Hindus.  In India, there is no social democracy for the lower castes and non-Hindus.  This book repeatedly reinforces this theme.  <br />Caste is a condition determined by birth.  There are no social classes in India; there is only caste.  In 1980, an appointed commission counted 3,743 castes composed of people who are socially and educationally deprived.  Each caste is defined by their traits, such as dialect, and their occupation, such as leather workers or weavers.  Over half of India's population are denied opportunities that Brahmins claim as exclusive to their caste.<br />When the British made India their colony, they assisted in legitimizing the Brahmin position by employing them and collaborating with them by using their existing power over the Muslim minority and the Shudra majority.  When India gained its independence, the transfer of power went to the Brahmins, or from the \\"white\\" British to the \\"brown\\" British.  But power over the lower castes had never left the Brahmin Hindus.<br />In 1938, Mohandas Gandhi, known as the Father of India, defended tradition in The Story of My Experiments with Truth.  He did not want to upset the status quo too much, tending toward \\"separate, but equal\\" when talking about providing opportunities to Shudras and breaking down the barriers between Brahmins and untouchables.  Gandhi saw caste as a natural division of labor.  Although Gandhi had visions of a nonsectarian society for India, his words and ideas are largely forgotten in today's India.<br />At the same time, another leader named Bhim Rao Ambedkar emerged.  An untouchable who was educated to the doctorate level in New York and London, Ambedkar called for the complete annihilation of caste.  The culture of caste, he said, is \\"a four-storied building without a staircase.\\"    The ideas of another leader are also forgotten.  Jawaharal Nehru preached Hindu secularism and called for a national government based upon truth and justice.  He wrote: \\"There can be no equality of status and opportunity within the framework [of caste], nor can there be political democracy, and much less, economic democracy.\\"  His attempts to eliminate caste by forced economic development were ultimately a failure.  Today, the government, the legal system and law enforcement represent the Hindu elite.  Members of the lower castes cannot expect truth and justice from religious and racial bigots.<br />Statistics about India are staggering - slum and street dwellers account for one half of the main cities' population.  This equates to 4.38 million people in Calcutta,  4.12 million in Bombay, 3.2 million in Delhi and 2.1 million in Madras.  The top one percent of the people controls 14 percent of the wealth while the bottom fifty percent of the population accounts for seven percent of the monetary resources.  In rural areas, only one out of a hundred girls who begin school will finish class twelve.  Eighty percent ofillnesses are caused by water-borne diseases.  Out of 142 major cities, 72 have no sewage systems at all.  In New Delhi, with a population of 9.4 million people, untreated wastewater, including 450 tons of solid waste, is dumped daily - directly into the Yumuna river.  Unequal land distribution, social inequality, threats of disease, rampant illiteracy, alcoholism, and poverty seem like insurmountable problems when Democracy in India reveals the huge numbers of people affected by the problems.<br />The population of India is estimated to increase to one billion people by 2000 and 1.7 billion by 2025, but these projections are dependent upon changes in social policies that encourage education of females and improved health care vice sterilization.  The government's  sterilization efforts are viewed as anti-Hindu, particularly since Muslims may have several wives and many children.<br />This book brings the reader greater understanding about the institution of caste and how it causes social inequality.  The economic health of India suffers because of the immense inequality.  India's only hope is mass education, training and human resource development that reaches all of India's people, without regard to their caste, race, gender or religion.  Until the population is educated, inequality will cause continued religious intolerance, racial and gender discrimination, and will result in further acts of violence.  Although there is a slight editorial error (missing text between pages 133 and 135) in Democracy in India, the authors present a large amount of factual information and clearly interpret the information in the context of caste.	2001-02-13

Chapter Ten is an excellent overview of how twenty nations on six continents became deeply and fatally involved with what Stueck calls a \\"substitute for World War III.\\"<br />I was grateful for the maps that Stueck provides along with his text.  Because Stueck rarely provides a year along with a date, I could not tell if he was going forward or backward to explain a point.  His skipping around in time was confusing.  My knowledge of the Korean War before I read this book was fairly limited, gleaned from years of watching MASH on TV.  Because of Stueck's thorough coverage, I now know many of the international nuances behind the historical relationship between the US and Korea.	2001-02-13

Author Stanley Wolpert, UCLA professor of Indian history, presents well-researched information.  Wolpert was given access to private files and letters that make his text gleam with insightful tidbits of Nehru's life.  There is no doubt that Nehru's influence on India was profound during his life and since his death in 1964.  <br />I began to think of Nehru as a \\"rascal\\" and this label for him continued to cross my mind as I read further.  Although Nehru studied law at Cambridge, he had little interest in it.  What did interest him was wandering around Europe, sitting in hot tubs at Harrogate's hydro, and acting, dressed as a seductive woman, in Victorian tableaux.  Whenever he needed money to pursue his dalliances, he would ask his father for more.  If Motilal would refuse, he would ask his mother to intercede.  <br />Meanwhile, world events began to change India's attitude toward British colonialism.  During World War I, over one million Indian troops fought for the British Empire, with over 100,000 killed.  Not ones to show their gratitude, the British passed the Black Acts in 1915 that suspended Indian civil liberty and judicial due process.  Nehru traveled through India with Gandhi to speak about Indian independence.  Of the masses who greeted Gandhi, Nehru said that they were \\"dull...and uninteresting individually,\\" but \\"produced a feeling of overwhelming pity and a sense of ever-impending tragedy.\\"<br />By the late 1920's, Nehru was heavily entangled in Indian politics.  Although he signed the Delhi manifesto, a compromise that gave India dominion status rather than full independence, he felt guilty about going against his inner voice.  His fervent speeches about Indian independence led to years of incarceration.  While in court in 1934 charged with sedition, Nehru stated his desire to \\"achieve the independence of India and to put an end to foreign domination.\\"  His approach to Indian independence became even more radical, moving further away from Gandhi's peaceful resistance.  In public, however, Nehru did not admit his swing away from Gandhi's passivity.  He recognized Gandhi's popularity as a guru.  Gandhi, in turn, recognized Nehru's political support.   <br />If ever a movie is made about Nehru, I am certain that the bulk of the story will be on his liaisons with Edwina, Claire Boothe Luce and others.  Fortunately, author Stanley Wolpert does not dwell on this portion of Nehru's life in his book, but rather concentrates on Nehru's obvious impact upon India's government.  Of course, a movie about Nehru's many years of incarceration would be quite boring.  I found many parts of this book difficult to follow because Wolpert jumps around in time faster than a Quentin Tarantino movie.  The absolute worst omission from the book is that there is no map of India or of south Asia.  I am not the sort who carries a world map in my head, so when a book like this is chock-a-block full of references to geographical features and political strife, why is there is no map to which to refer? Other than this serious lack, the book is a thoughtful and well-researched focus on a great world leader.	2001-02-13

Nicole Nagel uses multicolored sponges (Spongo) and pieces of licorice whips (Annisac) to make purses.  Sharon Peters makes Oreo cookie beads out of glass and mixes them with glass cow beads and udder beads to make \\"Recycling at Daisy's Dairy.\\"  One Jurors' award went to James Edward Talbot of Austin, TX who made \\"Fully On #2,\\" three faucets with beads as water.  <br />\\"One Alcoholic's Life: A Tangled Web\\" was Sue Eckman von Ohlsen's artistic statement that received another Jurors' Award.  An Early Times whiskey bottle is in a hoop haphazardly webbed in thick black beads.  From the bottle pours whiskey-colored seed beads, followed by white beads, then larger, blood-red beads.  Of this art, Sue says, \\"As alcohol flows, it becomes tears and then blood,which symbolize the pain, destruction and ultimate death caused by addiction.\\"	2001-01-03

It is a culmination of over thirty years of  Oppi's research.  His book covers more than just Indian jewelry, but  forehead marks and henna mendhi.<br />Inspired by trips to New York's museums  when he was young, Oppi crafts a anthropological journey through a  fascinating history of human ornamentation, beginning with wood ash and  mud.  Oppi traveled extensively to personally research his subject in  association with scholarships he won, including a Fulbright scholarship and  funding from John D Rockefeller III.  <br />He shows the use of natural items  in jewelry, such as leaves, flowers, seeds, vines and wood.  Unusual  jewelry materials like anteater claws are pictured.  Of course, gemstones  and precious metals are included.  There are photos of elegant gold  filigree and fist-sized gemstones.<br />My favorite part of the book is called  \\"Typology from Head to Toe\\" in which Oppi takes you on a journey in  pictures of people wearing ornaments in their hair to those worn on the  toes.  The book includes an extensive index and bibliography.  It is a very  human book, showing how ornaments are worn by people, not just showing  photos of the ornaments alone as many other ethnic jewelry books  do.<br />Although you might think the subject of Indian jewelry is narrow  before you see the book, a glance through the book will make you want to  own it even though the sticker price is high.	2000-08-03

In her book, she shows six beadwork techniques to create 23 necklace and earring sets.  Techniques include: backstitch,  netting, brick stitch and edge beading, peyote stitch, and split-loom  weaving.<br />Even if you are familiar with these techniques, Jeanette's book  is worth a look because of her last chapter, a \\"Gallery of Beadwork by  Alaskan Artists.\\"  Readily apparent is the influence of Alaska's wilderness  on the work of these artists.  <br />Donna Affinito submitted an earth-toned  amulet bag and a butterfly barrette she fashioned from \\"bits and pieces  from my bead box.\\"  \\"Fire and Icicles\\" and \\"Sitting on the Dock of the Bay\\"  are Ruby Brooks's seed bead contributions.  Jana Chisum Coffey does  lampwork using Morreti glass.  She fashions beads that look like shells.   <br />Lillian Ann Dewilde uses unusual, natural materials for her jewelry.   She embellishes smoked moosehide with Swarovsky crystals.  Most unusual is  her use of dyed caribou and reindeer hair, arranged in tufts like on a  chenille bedspread.  Porcupine quills decorate a heart-shaped box and  necklace.<br />Jacqueline Poston uses one of lampwork artist Andrea Guarino's  beads in a complicated \\"Tidal Pool\\" necklace.  The author Jeanette shows  her sense of humor with her \\"Moose Nugget Factory\\" amulet bag  necklace.<br />Rebecca Starry lives up to her name with a spectacular \\"In Full  Bloom.\\"  She employs brick stitch and horizontal square stitch in colorful  three-dimensional flowers, using Michelle Waldron's delicate lampwork beads  for stamens.<br />Yes, this book may echo others in beadwork techniques, but  you can certainly get new ideas from the Alaskan artists represented in  Beaded Adornment.	2000-04-21

Not knowing that much about jewelry construction at the  time, this book became my primer for techniques and ideas.  Over the years,  I have returned to Beads! for a refresher anytime that my ideas start to  run out.<br />Stefany has a keen sensitivity toward bead history and  craftsmanship.  She includes interesting photographs of ancient beads and  contemporary beads and jewelry.  One photo of English lace-bobbin spangle  beads is worth at least an hour's study time.  The variety of glasswork is  so amazing on these bobbin beads which helped lace weavers to remember the  order of their threads.<br />I have Stefany to thank for two awards I won for  two necklaces, both made with beads I crafted using the papier roule'  technique she shows on page 73.  A long, narrow triangle of paper is rolled  with glue with the long point on the outside of the bead and the short base  on the inside.  Using interesting paper for your papier roule' results in a  very pretty bead.<br />The detailed glossary, bead history timeline, and  appendices are worth the price of this book.	2000-04-21

Jane asks you to look at  the world around you - the way a tree bends or the texture of a rock.  Everything can become a source of ideas for design by their shape, feel,  composition, whether the material is stiff or pliable.  Craft stores are  shunned by many artists and should not be ruled out.  They, too, can be a  springboard to another idea.<br />Jane's book reminds you of your Kindergarten  class.

True, this exhibit is possibly the only time these items from private collections will be on display.  But do not despair.  There is still a wonderful catalog out there to be had.   <br />When my friends and I went to see this exhibit, we were so enamoured by  the beauty of the jewelry, we wanted to carry it all home with us.  The  catalog was the best we could do.<br />The items in this exhibit that were  designed and made by Rene' Lalique moved classicism to modernism.  Although  the luminosity of the jewelry is certainly lost in the book's photographs,  like the sheen of the perfectly matched opals and the glow of the glass  enamels, the level of detail is not.  <br />The exhibit was set up to light  the plique-a'-jour from the rear of the pieces as well as from the front.   Plique-a'-jour is similar to cloisonné.  Both techniques use glass enamels  separated by cells created from metal, but cloisonné is applied onto a  metal surface, whereas plique-a'-jour is openwork, more like a stained  glass window.  The difference in effect is that plique-a'-jour has a glow  that lights up the jewelry, whereas cloisonné receives its shine from the  metal behind it.<br />The plique-a'-jour technique was not new, having been  used during the Renaissance but had been virtually forgotten.  The  influence of the relatively new trade with Japan opened up the eyes of  those artists who were participants in the new arts &amp; Crafts movement  centered in London.  In fact, Lalique studied in London and picked up on  the Japanese influences.  In addition, there was also a religious movement  centered in Germany at this time that centered more upon appreciation of  nature than a single deity.<br />These influences combined in Lalique's  jewelry that stunned the world when he unveiled over a hundred pieces of  bijou at the Exposition Universalle in Paris in 1900.  Critics of his work  charged that he was merely trying to provoke the public.  Thepublic  crowded around the exhibit during its run nonetheless, although not all of  the items in the exhibit sold during the Exposition.  The opal necklace  that all of us loved when we saw this exhibit in Dallas was one that did  not sell, surprisingly enough.<br />So, if you simply could not get to Dallas,  then the catalog rates a good look so that you can study Lalique's  breathtaking style.  He was never matched and, in fact, abandoned making  jewelry for glass when cheap, shoddily made knock-offs began to appear.   Lalique felt he had gone as far as he could go with jewelry and became a  direct Tiffany competitor.	2000-04-21

Jane and Renita used embellished cloth to create clothing  that glowed with imagination.<br />The main message of the book is to play, as  if you were a child, with materials of all sorts.  Jane asks you to look at  the world around you - the way a tree bends or the texture of a rock.   Everything can become a source of ideas for design by their shape, feel,  composition, whether the material is stiff or pliable.  Craft stores are  shunned by many artists and should not be ruled out.  They, too, can be a  springboard to another idea.<br />Jane's book reminds you of your Kindergarten  class.  Everyday, found materials can be made into beads.  Whether the  resource materials were meant to be used to make beads will be of no  consequence.  You can make beads with them anyhow.  Prepare to be  surprised!	2000-04-21

It is full of intriguing new ways to fasten jewelry.  The author has a ready resource of  fantastic materials from Gablonz Glass World in the Czech Republic.   Certainly, after looking at the beads and findings, you begin to wish  Gablonz was as near as Houston. <br />One of the simplest, but very effective  methods of fastening E-beads together is with jump rings.  The effect is  delicate, but sturdy.  This method can be used for a bracelet or necklace.   <br />Another striking way to use beads is to put beads of different shapes on  headpin, then loop the end of the headpin to make a charm.  Alternate  stringing a bead directly on wire with five of your charms.  This gives the  necklace a loose, swingy effect.<br />Many of the materials in Renate's book  are unique to Europe, but don't let that discourage you.  I caught myself  thinking that I could make similar jewelry elements using polymer clay,  although I admit to a sudden urge to visit Gablonz.	2000-04-21

I had studied comparative religions when I was in college, so the origins and practice of vodou are of natural interest to me, but I knew absolutely  nothing about vodou until seeing this exhibit.  Having lived in New  Orleans, I had always thought that voodoo involved sticking pins into dolls  to bring bad luck or disease to an enemy and other darkly occult rituals.   Obviously, I didn't understand vodou at all, not even to know the correct  spelling.  The Hollywood film industry is responsible for a large part of  our misconceptions about vodou.  <br />I quote André Pierre, a contributor to  the catalog: \\"The Vodou religion is before all other religions.  It is more  ancient than Christ.  It is the first religion of the Earth.  It is the  creation of the World.  The World is created by Vodou. The world is created  by magic.  The first magician is God who created people with his own hands  from the dust of the Earth.  People originated by magic in all countries of  the world.  No one lives of the flesh.  Everyone lives of the  spirit.\\"<br />Spirits (lwa) of vodou define parts of the universal human  experience.  The spirits all have names and personalities, very much like  Roman Catholic saints.  Like Mexican altars to deceased ancestors for El  Dia de los Muertos, these vodou spirits are offered their favorite things  that represent these personalities.  These items are placed on altars or  sewn in sequins and beads on 36\\" x 36\\" flags in their honor.  The spirits,  like saints, are invoked to grant favors or assist in getting through a  difficult time, or they are praised for their virtues and help.<br />My two  favorite Vodou spirits are Ezili Freda and Ezili Danto. These cousins are  diametrically opposed forces of femininity.  Ezili Freda represents love  and luxury, a city girl who has elegant fashion sense, likes sweet drinks  and Virginia Slims cigarettes. She looks pretty, dressed in white lace with  pink trim.  Her day is Thursday.  Mater Dolorosa represents Ezili Freda.   <br />Her country cousin Ezili Danto is linked to protective motherhood.  She  dresses in bright red and blue calicos and drinks strong rum.  Black pigs  symbolize Ezili Danto and her favorite food is fried pork.  She smokes  unfiltered Camel cigarettes and her days are Tuesdays and Saturdays.  Our  Lady of Mount Carmel and Mater Salvatoris represent Ezili Danto.<br />This  catalog allows a closer study of the brilliant sequin art associated with  vodou.  Spirit bottles, mirrors, jackets, vests, leggings and flags are  covered with the flash of sequins that are anchored with seed beads.  The  symbols of the vodou spirits and their aspects are reflected by the designs  made with the sequins and beads.<br />The Sacred Arts catalog is an obviously  well researched and comprehensive look at Vodou.  I highly recommend it for  a broad range of people, from cultural anthropologists to decorative  artists.	2000-04-21

She had a penchant for the unusual with her ostentatious accessories.  She was born in 1899 in Tell  City, Indiana to immigrant parents (a Russian father and a Prussian  mother).  <br />At the dawn of the Roaring Twenties, she moved to New York  City with $500 in her pocket, opening a small boutique.  Named Le Bijou de  L'Heure, there she sold costume jewelry that she designed.  In the early  1920's, Haskell advertised that \\"colored glass necklaces, one for each  outfit, are considered a necessity this year.\\"<br />Not only was Haskell  riding the wave of the Roaring Twenties, she was creating a wave of her  own.  The Twenties were the years that all of the fashion rules were  broken.  Haskell's unbounded creativity met with enormous popularity.  The  prices for her costume jewelry were much lower than the cost of precious  metals and stones, so anyone could afford to look fashionable.  <br />The  popularity of her costume jewelry continued, even after the stock market  crash.  Her sales did not drop significantly until 1931.  Another  difficulty Haskell encountered was the lack of material available for  jewelry during WWII when glass from Bohemia and white metal was  scarce.<br />Haskell never registered her designs, although she began to sign  her pieces in 1950.  The Miriam Haskell trademark was not received until  1988, 64 years after she began designing.  Because there were no marks to  identify her work prior to 1950, it took a great deal of research on author  Cera's part to verify pieces of costume jewelry as Haskell's.  Cera relied  upon advertisements in magazines and newspapers, and photographs of movie  stars shown wearing jewelry attributed to Haskell.<br />Haskell drew  inspiration for her designs from many cultures - South America, China,  Greece and the US southwest Indian designs.  Her designs mimicked or  consisted of any and all materials, including flotsam, stones, seeds,  berries and beans.<br />For the collector of costume jewelry, this book is a  keeper.	2000-04-21

Ger catches  every tiny detail in his sketches of people wearing not only jewelry but  body tattoos and fantastic costumes.  In most cases, the sketches were made  from photographs, some of which were very old.  Wood engravings and objects  from private collections are additional sources for his sketches.<br />The  illustrations are grouped together, with only the country of origin listed  under the picture.  A detailed description of each item precedes the  illustrations, so you have to do a bit of flipping from one section to  another to learn about each picture.  That's OK, though, because you can  compare and contrast the styles of different cultures without distraction  of text, then later go back-and-forth to learn more.      <br />Because the  illustrator is from Germany, he may not sufficiently appreciate the  familiar European ethnic jewelry.  Only a very few pages are devoted to  Europe compared to the many pages for other parts of the world.	2000-04-21

There she sells antique and traditional folk art from Latin America.  Her studies of Latin American folk art have led her to write this book.  She has also written a book about milagros and a novel about art brokering and smuggling.  She is currently working on a book about Latin American  jewelry.<br />On 13 Feb 2000, I attended her lecture at the San Antonio Museum  of Art where Martha has her private collection of relicarios on loan for  exhibit.  I encourage you to see this exhibit while it is at  SAMOA.<br />Relicarios are devotional miniature pendants or lockets.  They  sometimes contain bits of bone, tooth, or cloth, reputedly from a saint.   Many have survived from the conquest because they were treasured by  families or the church.  They are often elaborate and finely crafted.   Materials used to make relicarios include wood, metal, bone, ivory, and  shell.<br />Relicarios were worn suspended around the neck from a chain or  cord.  Some are displayed on walls or hung onto church sculptures of saints  to honor an answered prayer.  Relicarios are still used today as a talisman  to \\"inspire, comfort, and protect the bearer from harm.\\"<br />A miniature  painting or sculpture of a saint is sometimes protected by glass on a  relicario.  Some relicarios are two-sided works of art.  For this reason,  SAMOA displays some relicarios so thay can be viewed from both sides.<br />In  her book, Martha describes the ancient origins of relicarios from Greek and  Roman times in which \\"the physical remains of gods or heroes were thought  to have magical properties, and possession of such treasures conferred  religious and political status upon the owner.\\"  Encolpium contained a bit  of cloth dipped in the oil from lamps burned in front of saints'  sarcophagi.  The cloth could also have been dipped in a martyr's blood, or  could have come from clothing worn by a saint.<br />As with anything of value,  authenticity of relics is questionable.  Martha cites \\"no fewer than a  dozen heads and sixty fingers of Saint John the Baptist (this is spite of  the alleged burning of his corpse by Emperor Julian in the fourth century);  seven foreskins from the infant Jesus; fifteen arms of Saint James; thirty  bodies of Saint George; and six breasts of Saint Agatha.\\"  When Saint  Elisabeth of Thuringia was buried, her body was quickly torn apart by  devotees.  John Calvin asked for an end to all this relic madness in  1543.<br />Martha's book is an interesting read.	2000-03-16

Did this book have information not contained in my other three books?  Was this book's new information of sufficient quantity that I couldn't just memorize the new techniques and not spend the money?    Billed on the back cover as the \\"ultimate polymer clay book,\\" every page holds the same promise.  This book demonstrates the absolute versatility of the polymer clay medium.      Donna's organization of polymer clay techniques makes perfect sense.  She starts with the basics, then explains canes and loaves, followed by a host of surface treatments.  Mould-making is next, then there are Tory Hughes's imitative techniques for bone, stone, and coral.  Donna gives liberal credit to Tory.  Next, Donna hits on sculptural techniques in three chapters: vessels, floral forms, and figurines.    Vernon Ezell's photographs are colorful and sharp, enhancing Donna's instructive text.  You may have seen an article or two by Donna in Jewelry Crafts or Lapidary Journal magazines.  This book contains all of her ideas from those articles and lots more.      I pondered for four days whether I should spend the money for this book.  I bought it.  You should too if you already work with polymer clay or are considering whether you should start.  It's a real inspiration!	2000-03-16
