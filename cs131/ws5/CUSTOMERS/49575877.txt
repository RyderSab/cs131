US	49575877	R1U2L1PQ6GW2G	1400031575	342108579	Faceless Killers	Books	3	8	12	N	N	Decent page-turner with no soul	Let's face it. Mysteries are highly ritualized performances akin to Kabuki theater. There's a detective, the flawed symbol of ordinary good, who faces the violence, corruption, and perversion of the world at large. The crime introduces chaos to the world, its solution builds structure or logic, exploring a new order or unexplored arena of something hither fore familiar. Meanwhile, the pursuit of the mystery injures or pushes the detective to the breaking-point, as if the pursuit of the crime sickens or infects the sleuth. <br /> <br />It's no wonder that when we read a mystery, we're anticipating how an author adheres to conventions and how she strays from them. Part of the tension of reading a mystery - the engine that turns its pages - comes from the play of reader expectation against authorial execution. We might like a mystery that's never solved - but it'd have to be a heck of a book. <br /> <br />That's the background for why I thought Henning Mankell's \\"Faceless Killers\\" was both a good, quick read and completely forgettable. Basically, it followed the conventions of mystery too closely. <br /> <br />There's the detective, Kurt Wallender, who's divorced, a drunk, ill-behaved, lonely, always unsure of himself. His daughter - estranged, perhaps suicidal, dating an African - flits at the edge of the narrative like a ghost. He's confronted by a savage double murder on a remote farm with no apparent motive or clue. Bewildered by violence that seems to have crept to quiet, backwoods Sweden from more urbane areas, he leads a motely - and near completely faceless - cast of cops on a haphazard chase. As the case grinds on, Wallender gets nabbed for drunk driving, hits on his ex-wife, pulls a sexy young female prosecutor onto his lap, and comes down with a cold. <br /> <br />Not too much time is spent on character. The secondary cops all blend into one another. There's Wallender's sidekick, ol' cop Rydberg, who suffers from the usual ol' cop complaints of upset stomachs and creaky knees. There's the hot prosecutor, a babe who looks maybe thirty, who he ends up bedding. And so on. Even the social commentary of the foreigner question is really a gimmick, a frame for the symbolism of the usual insider/outsider questions of genre mystery fiction. <br /> <br />Take the prosecutor babe. There's only one detailed scene with her in the book, and that's when Wallender takes her out for dinner then winds up back at her place, drunk. It's obvious that she's interested, but then he gropes her and there's a scene - a scene that reinforces the usual mystery narrative of the beleaguered cop stumbling over his good motives - in this case, love - in pursuit of the end. When he finally \\"conquers\\" the prosecutor, it's related in a sentence, a quick mention. After all, it's totally expected. The grouchy, too-fat drunk cop detective always scores the babe. We don't need a reason why an ambitious, babely, married, urbane utlra-D.A. would even go for a backwater slob like Wallender. That's the way it happens in mystery fiction. <br /> <br />Great for an airplane ride or the beach. Not something either memorable or important. <br />	2005-09-14

A sliver here, a shard there, a piece fallen under the couch and pushed to the side. Assemble these moments and spread them out on the floor. Look: There's turn-of-the-century Oklahoma and the Creek resistance to statehood. Here's a tension-filled scene of sexuality, boyhood, a near-drowning on a lazy summer day. An old woman who used to play bebop in roadhouses. A Sherman-Alexie-like family of Native American poseurs/clowns who stubbornly and humorously cling to a white evangelical church in an utterly incompetent, utterly naive attempt to assimilate and somehow connect to our own pathetic outsider attempts to belong. <br /> <br />But they're shards. Only pieces. The whole is a mess. Multiple point-of-view with no apparent purpose. A plot that starts here, lingers there, ends up here - not a river meandering, but a series of puddles staining the sidewalk. Two main protagonists - Josh Henneha and Jimmy Alexander - who are virtually indistinguishable in their bookish, passive, overly thoughtful ways; products of a beginning writer writing about himself, most likely. The prose that forgets that each word is a prayer and for entire chapters lets itself goose-step across the page despite earlier and later stunning passages of exquisite beauty. <br /> <br />If I were an editor. If I were a publisher. I'd grab Womack. I'd cultivate and encourage. The subject matter is huge and poignant, the idea of us/them, insider/outsider, spirit/material. Womack's historical sections of turn-of-the-century Creek culture are stunning and engaging. The book itself has a certain human power rarely found in mass-produced fare: it fairly glows with rage and angst and love and fear.  <br /> <br />There's so much potential. I hope Womack is busy right now on his next book, and his next and next.	2005-09-06
US	49575877	R3NE1RPRNN3EXL	140003065X	366389334	A Fine Balance	Books	3	2	4	N	N	Teeters on the edge of sentimentality, but manages to stay aloft	Populated as it is with earnest, uncomplicated characters mouthing political sound bites, \\"A Fine Balance\\" nearly topples into a sentimental allegory on twentieth-century politics. But it doesn't, in large part to Mistry's depiction of India.  <br /> <br />The protagonists - a college student (Maneck Kohlah), two village tailors (Ishvar Darji and his nephew Omprakash), and a widowed seamstress from an uppper-class family (Dina Dalal) - represent the varied social and economic classes of India. Thrown together by national events into Dalal's apartment, the four form a friendship based on the essential proletarian traits (at least as Mistry sees it) of empathy, gregariousness, and love. Opposed to these naive and tender-hearted \\"everymen\\" are the government officials, police, upper caste members, doctors, and landlords, who universally lack tender emotions, and who put our heroes through a Herculean obstacle course of forced labor camps, inter-caste warring, gender politics, and the struggle for basic economic survival. The basic premise is that, without the artificial socio-economic structures of class and gender, we would all get along splendidly. <br /> <br />This may even be true, but it makes for clunky fiction. Much comparison has been made between Dickens and Mistry, and it's well earned for the sheer breadth of Mistry's social vision. But Dickens always placed character ahead of politics, and when politics intruded too much he added a heavy dash of humor and ironic absurdism, which help temper the instruction, and which is completely lacking in \\"A Fine Balance.\\" <br /> <br />Still, it is evident that Mistry loves India. His descriptions of the country are so lovingly rendered and full of ordinary details that his setting comes alive in a very real way. And this saves the book. While the characters' political work leaves them flat, their Indian-ness re-animates them. Mistry creates a land that is both lush and romantic, and squalid and pathetic. <br />	2005-09-03

The collection of first-hand accounts thrills and terrifies, pays appropriate homage to the boys that rushed the beach that day. But Ambrose's inability to paint the larger picture, to escape the intellectually narrow confines of his jingoistic viewpoint, to ply his craft of history with insight or originality handicaps the book, making the significant at times stoop to amateurism, the harrowing to the absurd. <br /> <br />The first-hand accounts are terrific. Better than terrific. The effect is of sitting in a room full of veterans telling their stories one-by-one. Ambrose does an excellent job of painting these men so that their voices are all too human. He does not shy away from cowardice or insanity or the bloodthirsty. He is fair. As a result we see a wide panoply of characters, of humanity, of men. <br /> <br />But Ambrose appears to use little or no historical research for this book. The controversy surrounding Montgomery's push to Caen is brushed off. The slow advance of the Brits is blamed on their habit of brewing tea in the afternoons. The Germans' failure to stop the Allies on the beach stems from their having lived under a totalitarian regime - and the Americans' success rested on democatic ideals. Eisenhower kicked butt; Rommel was an idiot. You spell success: i - n - f - a - n - t - r - y. And so on. <br /> <br />The overall organization and scholarship reminded me not of a historian but of a war correspondent, someone who was imbedded in the events and forever caught up in them. Ambrose is prejudiced against the British, just like the U.S. troops who viewed their allies as friendly rivals. He has nothing but disdain for the enemy and ascribes their actual battlefield superiority to fixed positions. Everything on D-Day is \\"the greatest of all time\\" - the greatest assembly of men in all time, the greatest firepower of all time, the greatest this and that. This book is more of a paen than a work of scholarly research. <br /> <br />But what Ambrose fails to acknowledge is that WWII wasn't won on the beaches of Normandy, but on the Eastern Front. The German army the Americans encountered was a shattered remnant of its former self, its best men and material already ground up on the Russian steppes. WWII was won, not by American farm boys, but by Soviet soldiers: men raised in a totalitarian regime. <br /> <br />(I don't mean to imply that the British and Americans played no part in WWII; they certainly hastened the war's end and enabled half of Europe to escape the brutal occupation by the Soviets, which eventually led to Communism's downfall, all vital and important events worth fighting for.) <br /> <br />But that's okay. \\"D-Day\\" is a cheer, a thank you, a gush of sentiment that protects the reader, the writer, and the participant from the stark, inhumane horror of war. D-Day needed to happen. And Ambrose helps us appreciate it, despite how it happened.	2005-08-23

The best of the lot - \\"Homemade\\" and \\"Disguises\\" - are dazzling in their detail and careful construction of character. Both are...perverted? twisted?...tales of misplaced sexuality. In \\"Homemade,\\" a boy rapes his prepubescent sister in order to experience sex for the first time; in \\"Disguises,\\" a boy is dressed in eccentric and sexually ambiguous costumes by his aunt, a former star of the stage. McEwan builds marvelous tension; each of these stories feels dangerous and vital. <br /> <br />The other stories vary from decent (\\"First Love, Last Rites\\") to downright terrible (\\"Cocker at the Theater\\"). In fact, \\"Cocker...\\" was so bad I laughed out loud when I finished it. The piece contains the usual public naked hijinks penned by literary-minded frat boys and submitted to undergraduate poetry mags and is just as poorly written. The rest of the stories are technically proficient but lack any sort of moral, human, or artistic depth. They are concept pieces combing self-loathing and sex. Perhaps utterly necessary to write, but equally difficult to read. <br /> <br />Still, I might recommend the collection - especially a used or borrowed copy - for the stories bookending the drivel in the middle.	2005-08-16
US	49575877	R3565JI8ZIEG1G	0375706852	127846038	My Name Is Red	Books	3	69	75	N	N	Structure, ideas fascinating; characters and language flat	This is a tough review to write. There's much to like about this book. There's much to dislike. Comparisons to Eco's \\"The Name of the Rose\\" are accurate; both books are period mysteries, both books explore the ideas of the time, both books aspire to larger stature than their genre. Neither book does, really. Literary fiction is all about character. Ultimately \\"My Name is Red\\" gives us intriguing and intricate philosophy and fascinating structure. But its characters are flat and its language tedious.<br />First, a quick note about the language. Does the translation stink? Or did Pamuk write convoluted, lifeless prose in the original? My guess the former. There are too many awkward sentences. The language is dull. I get the feeling the language is intended to represent a formal, fable-telling style. (More on this later.) But. It's too affected.<br />What really shines about \\"My Name is Red\\" is its fascinating story-within-a-story structure. The whole book is told as if by a coffee-house storyteller. Not only does the book unfold from multiple characters' points-of-view, but objects get voices, too - including a coin, Satan, and the color red. <br />Also the structure parallels the art form of book illustration that is at the heart of the novel. It's highly formal - all the narrators in the book speak with the same affected voice. It's traditional, in the spirit of \\"Arabian Nights,\\" which uses parables and stories-within-stories. It owes much of its spirit to Islam, yet flirts with blasphemous rejection of religion. It's bending towards Western influences - in the case of the book, mystery novels. And so does illustration in the novel. <br />Yet for all the fascinating philosophical digressions and observations on Islam and art, what drives the modern novel is character. And it's there that \\"My Name is Red\\" is weakest. Perhaps because the language remains too formal throughout, we never get a chance to get intimate with the book's populace - their thoughts, the patternof their speaking voices, the psychological impressions so vital to the 20th-century novel are missing here. There's also a weird obsession with sex running through the book - not in an interesting way, like in \\"Ulysses\\" - but in a middle-school, bodice-ripping way.<br />Still, the book is worth a read. It attempts to bring Middle East form and influence into a Western novel. The complexity of Pamuk's structure is awe-inspiring, certainly fascinating. Again, like \\"The Name of the Rose,\\" it instructs as much as it entertains, even if it falls short of its artistic aspirations.	2004-05-30
US	49575877	R1KUKR2T8D9RY3	0394757688	849452523	The Long Goodbye	Books	5	16	18	N	N	Complex noir book by genre master	\\"The Long Goodbye\\" is unlike most of Chandler's other novels. It's longer. It's loaded with more description, internal life, and character investigation. Its plot -- though seeming more random -- is actually tighter and more pointed than his earlier work. In some ways it's more ambituous and revealing than his other work. In other ways, it contradicts his earlier writing style. But no matter how you look at it...it's awesome.<br />There are a couple of things I've always admired in Chandler.<br />First, he conveys everything in scene. After an obligatory physical description, everybody is characterized through dialog or action. As a result, the plot flies by, and we are treated to a very concrete, participatory read.<br />Second, Philip Marlowe tells us almost nothing about himself or his background or even what he's thinking, but we know him better than we know ourselves, thanks to the gritty voice, the nature of his observations, and the conclusions he makes about his world.<br />\\"Goodbye\\" does these things, but slides more towards self-introspection. There are lengthy passages where Marlowe spends time by himself. These passages could seem awkward to the die-hard hardboiled detective fan, but they work. They also show Chandler's writing ability.<br />In \\"Goodbye,\\" a writer of popular novels plays a prominent role. Roger Wade writes romance best-sellers; he despises his own genre novels and aspires to write more literary fiction. As a reader of \\"Goodbye,\\" it's easy to see the paralells between Wade and Chandler, and \\"Goodbye\\" seems to be an attempt to write something \\"literary.\\"<br />But based on the success of \\"Goodbye\\" on its literary merits, it's evident that Chandler wrote the hardboiled dectective novels because he wanted to; not because he couldn't do anything else.	2004-01-16

So you know the story already, big deal. \\"Seabiscuit\\" is nonetheless a great yarn and a fun read. Hillenbrand crafted a winner, and it should make a swell movie.<br />First the crit. I got the feeling that the uglier sides of \\"Seabiscuit\\"'s characters were suppressed. Sure, Pollard was a drunk - although we never actually saw the fallout his alcoholism created - jockeys visited brothels and had eating disorders, the press was vicious and uninformed. But...there's an intriguing accusation against Smith that he doped his horses, and doping is a problem in horse racing just as it is in any other professional sport. Might the accusations be true? And there are mentions of feuds between riders, owners, and trainers...yet no conflict is explored. And what about corruption? Based on \\"Seabiscuit,\\" you'd think there were no fixed races. Somehow I doubt it.<br />But who cares? Hillenbrand was writing about an underdog, about her love for horse racing; she penned a tale about the downtrodden who finally got their big break and bucked the odds. It's a tale of myth of legend. Ambiguity and ambivalence don't belong. Normally, I'd fault a book for feeling a bit flat. After all, it's the curves in bumps in life that makes life, well, life, right? <br />Well...Hillenbrand pumps so much suspense, character, and detail into \\"Seabiscuit\\", that it satisfies my need for realistic characters, but manages to keep them pure. And in the process, \\"Seabiscuit\\" satisfies, too, my need for heroes.	2003-05-02

Bryson is first and foremost a humorist, a social commentator, and his work should be read as a the work of a dilettante. He ain't no professer of linguistiks!<br />Bryson does do an admirable job of introducing all the pit-and  pratfalls associated with the language, and I, for one, was absolutely stunned by the swiftness and extent of change that occurs constantly in our English, as portrayed by the author. I laughed at some - not many - of his jokes. Ultimately, it's not the humor that's this book's strong point, it's the protagonist, the hero of this drama, the English language that steals the show. Bryson is the carnie, the man who calls out to us and troops us by the freaks and geeks - the oddities of spelling and grammar, perhaps? - and we walk about the chaotic, disorganized spectacle, taking it all in.<br />So if you're curious about English, check out this book.

Swafford turned his head inside-out and spilled his thoughts out onto paper. The force, the brutality, the fear, the violence, and sex oozing from his prose is astounding. It's entrancing. It's a grim song, a poem of death, of youth, of the United States.<br />\\"Jarhead\\" contains the contradictions of America. The noble, peaceful ideals of our country and its sometime violent application of force. The reality of the American Dream, but the gut strength and force required to achieve it. The worship of youth and its beauty, and the degradation of mind and body through drink, drugs, and sex. Here's a boy who joins up for both selfish and noble reasons, who finds a crazy, brutal, horrific place, which he eventually comes to love for the humanity he found in its terror.<br />Is this what it's like to serve as a marine? Only a marine can tell you. But it feels honest. Swafford cuts through fluff, shears away illusion, and tries to deal fairly with his past. He shares his experiences by sucking you into his brain with his voice. It's eerie. Creepy. Startlingly effective.<br />The book's main flaw is also a symptom of Swafford's character. In it, Swafford is unable to sum up his feelings. He tries to at the end of the book in a few choppy sections - conveying a sense of confusion - he gives us a few garbled summations of his feelings, but...it didn't work for me. Some reviewers took his book to be an anti-war tract. I'm not so sure about that. But I would like to know. What has he learned? The confusion at the end seems to say that Swafford hasn't figured it out yet.	2003-04-15
US	49575877	R2LBSETB3JRZRX	044900371X	429783385	The Orchid Thief: A True Story of Beauty and Obsession (Ballantine Reader's Circle)	Books	3	3	6	N	N	It should have remained a magazine article	Susan Orlean, on a quest to describe obsession using the world of orchid collectors as a model, ends up falling prey to her own obsession with facts, history, and place, and her book \\"The Orchid Thief\\" devolves into a hodge-podge of unrelated tidbits that strut and preen with purported purpose, but in the end mean...nothing. However, despite the scrambled mess of the overall structure, Orlean did indeed create numerous beautifully descriptive passages and also gave us an unforgettable character, John Laroche.<br />First, I'll be the first to admit that Orlean often provided fantastic images...the planes flying over swampland, dropping bags of flour on sold lots of land...the author wading through a swamp with prison inmates armed with machetes...and any scene involving John Laroche. Her strength lies in describing the absurd.<br />But. For every fascinating scene, Orlean heaps five mind-numbing, unrelated, dull scenes into her book. Despite claiming that the orchid-obsessed characters were fascinating...they come out seeming...uninteresting and identical. Hippies in BMWs, plant smugglers, arrogant orchid breeders. They're all the same! They talk about orchids in the same way. They gossip about plants. They're...unreal. Quite astounding considering they are real. Except for Laroche. Who brings electricity to his scenes, almost as if his personality so seeped under Orlean's skin that she brought him to life, despite her obvious inability to render other characters in print.<br />And where is Laroche in this book? The title is \\"The Orchid Thief,\\" implying that he somehow forms the central idea of the book. But he's absent from 80 percent of its pages. And when the book comes to a close, he's hardly changed by the experience. Laroche was the bait to the story, not the story itself, and it were better that he had been relegated to a minor role.<br />But the bottom line: this is not a book-length story. It should have remained an article.	2003-04-01
US	49575877	R1LOROKB6L1C6G	0060930535	951868170	The Poisonwood Bible (Oprah's Book Club)	Books	3	20	26	N	N	Succumbs to its flaws.	A very ambitious book, indeed, in which Kingsolver tells the story from five different viewpoints, five unique voices. And she tackles Africa, attempting to tell a story about the Congo/Zaire that will relate to us, her First-World readers. It's ironic, then, that Kingsolver, while trying to write a book on Africa, actually writes about book about the United States.<br />The first part of \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" is an interesting narrative as told by the four Price daughters of a Baptist missionary family adapting - or failing to adapt - to the culture and climate of a Congolese jungle village in the 1960s. The four girls each have a distinct voice, representing four distinct types - from Rachel, the spoiled American teenager, to Leah, the intelligent achiever who ends up \\"going native.\\"<br />But the book quickly turns political. Kingsolver has the Prices in the Congo through independence, Lumumba's election and subsequent assassination financed by the CIA, and the unpleasant aftermath of civil war and chaos. The different girls soon devolve into political allegories. Rachel's spoiled teen act devolves into the racist, ignorant pro-American persona that is ultimately responsible in Kingsolver's world for the subjugation of African democracy and prosperity. Leah, the achiever, remains in Africa and becomes a kind of heroic figure of opposition to American power and culture, renouncing material comforts to ally herself with the New Africa. Kingsolver's tone gets preachy, and the complex problems of the African subcontinent get simplified into a single palatable message: the West is keeping Africa down.<br />I don't doubt Kingsolver's resolve, her beliefs, and I'm not questioning her research or sources one bit. Her depiction of Africa feels real. But like so many other books about Africa written by outsiders (\\"A Bend in the River,\\" \\"Heart of Darkness,\\" etc.), \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" really describes and characterizes its author and her culture more than it does Africa.In this book, we are treated to a distinctly American depiction of travel, of prosperity, and of culture.<br />In this book, Kingsolver implies through the voice of Leah, that Africa was once a primal Arcadia until European explorers \\"discovered\\" the continent and enslaved its people and apportioned the land into colonies. African's inability to adapt to Western culture and technology - according to Kingsolver -- has to do with the intractability of the land, and the belief system created by thousands of years' of tribal tradition and culture. Westerners only sully or contaminate Africa's ideals and \\"natural\\" systems of government. Ideas shared, ironically, by the original European visitors to Africa.<br />Also, Kingsolver indicts America's over-prosperous culture. Leah upon returning to Georgia after living in Africa, finds her cheap student housing overly oppressive. So much so that she has to move back to Africa as soon as possible. Which is a truly typical American reaction to prosperity: what other culture's people would spurn comfort and plenty and return to poverty and misery - for an idea? America is chock full of such self-abnegating or dangerous ideals and past-times: vegetarianism, eating disorders, weight-loss programs, Buddhist retreats, long-distance hikers, extreme sports.<br />I don't wish to excoriate Kingsolver for these ideals. This naïve optimism is the main reason I love my country, the United States. This belief that there is an ideal to aspire to, to sacrifice for. That there can be a perfect society built on Earth. That someone should, in fact, try to do so.<br />However, at times her book deals clumsily with these issues. Characters lose their complexity when they begin to stand for an ideal. Rachel, for example, becomes uniformly bad, and loses all trace of humanity. She's easy to hate. As such, she may be an effective tool to denigrate a political view, a propaganda tool, but she ceases to be a quality literary device. She tells us nothing about the human character.<br />Though the writing is at times brilliant, and the first part of the book was engrossing, overall \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" succumbs to its flaws.	2003-02-26

Beating out \\"Sabbath's Theater\\"... \\"The Human Stain\\" is a fascinating book.<br />Coleman Silk, professor at Athena college, resigns in the midst of a scandal. He's accused of calling two black students \\"spooks.\\" Thing is, he himself is black, but he's been passing for white since the Second World War. Roth's long-time protagonist, Nathan Zuckerman, is there to tell the story.<br />The irony! That a black man is accused of being a white oppressor! That a black man who has passed as, and enjoyed all the advantages for being white for so long cannot admit to his past in order to save himself! <br />The connection to the past. Silk's \\"passing\\" is a story of another time, of segregation, of the nation before the struggle for civil rights. It's a story of America in the Second World War. But the racial divide that existed then, and the choices Roth's characters made then still dog his protagonists to the present. You can't escape your past. You can't change the way things were. Silk spans an incredible time of immense change. It finally does him in.<br />And then, the feeling of this book. An old man's book. A book of lament, of regret. Zuckerman's impotency after colon surgery forever ends his sexual escapades. He's forced into solitude and contemplation. He's forced into passivity, into the role that his women characters usually inhabit. But the book still manages to celebrate life. Silk's last sexual escapade is depicted as a man's final free moment, his final stab at an immediate and sensuous life, sexual life free from anxiety and expectation. And perhaps Zuckerman can appreciate it all the more because of his own deficiency. <br />Interesting note: I grew up in the Berkshires and recognized much of the setting from firsthand experience. One place Roth writes about is Pleasant Valley bird sanctuary in Lenox, Massachusetts. That's the area where Fauina Farley visits the raven. <br />I actuallyattended the Pleasant Valley's summer camp, first as a camper, then as a junior counselor. So you see? I knew that raven, the old, sly bird who had a bent beak! ...and I felt like Roth had stolen something from my own childhood, my own memories, something that was personal. A detail I would use in my own writing... Funny, that.	2003-02-20

On one hand, it's filled with vivid scenes and lively, realistic characters. On the other hand, the book feels incomplete, and we're left wondering...what? who? where? Do we actually learn anything crucial about these characters? I think so...but I'm not sure what.<br />First, the scenes are definitely vivid, peopled with real-feeling characters. Fitzgerald is marvelous at characterization. Woodie's unconcern about his boat's leak because the water has risen only as far as the first bunk in his bedroom. Tilda and Martha's discovery of an antique tile in the river bottom and their subsequent haggling with an antiques dealer. Heinrich's polite demeanor - we learn more about him through what he doesn't say.<br />But all in all, the main characters, especially Nenna, are indecisive. Nenna doesn't visit her husband because she doesn't want to face the possibility that she might lose him. Nenna lives on the barge because she doesn't know where else to live. Nenna and her family move to Canada only because her sister's forceful personality overwhelms her. Such indecisiveness is not the great stuff of memorable literary characters.<br />But...as Nenna's neighbor Maurice mentions, the people on the barges live half on the water and half on land precisely because they can't decide who they are. The barges then are the metaphor for this indecisiveness...and that's ultimately what the novel is about.<br />I wanted more than that. I wanted a novel three times as large, a book that lived with the characters longer, and illustrated the conflicts more clearly. What exactly was at risk for Nenna in not seeing her husband? She admits that seeing him might dash her hope of living with him - but people say a lot of things, and she appears quite content living without him in the first place.<br />I would've also liked to have visited with the characters after the crucial changes that altered their lives. Why exactly didNenna choose to move to Canada? How has Richard come to accept his fate as faithful suburban husband?<br />In any case, Fitzgerald's prose is fantastic, and the layout of scenes is near perfect. I think it's rather a compliment to her that I feel this book is incomplete. I plan to read more of her books in the future.	2003-02-11
US	49575877	R11C52RFEA1K17	0060930888	630454514	April 1865: The Month That Saved America	Books	2	13	18	N	N	Poorly researched distortion of crucial events	Winik's book, \\"April 1865,\\" is a mix of good and bad. He's written a readable treatise, and has emphasized events that were previously discounted or that remained unlinked. Unfortunately, his research is anything but scholarly, and some of his conclusions are based on myth and wishful thinking rather than fact. Combine this with prose that often strays into hyperbole, and you get a book that infuriates the educated Civil War buff as much as it enlightens.<br />Here are a few things that Winik made me think about: (1) That there might have been alternatives to a peaceful surrender at Appomattox and elsewhere. (2) The Confederacy's plan to enlist blacks into their army might have been as much a consequence of enlightenment as it was from desperation. (3) John Wilkes Booth, whom I had never read much about before. I had no idea he was so famous. It'd be like Russell Crowe knocking of Bush. (4) Secession was an American tradition.<br />Unfortunately, Winik's bibliography is woefully thin. It would appear that he based most of his book on popular - and generally well-regarded - existing narratives, such McPherson's \\"Battle Cry of Freedom\\" and Foote's Civil War narrative, not to mention the largely romanticized and academically ancient (1934) biography of Lee by Douglas Southall Freeman. Because Winik did not research the primary sources himself, his book is at least twice removed from the actual events. Anyone who's played \\"operator\\" knows what distortion must result.<br />Winik's shoddy research sheds doubt on most of his assertions. His riskiest assertion, concerning the Confederacy's latent emancipation movement, looks no more than wistful speculation backed as it is by no credible source. Considering overwhelming evidence showing the Confederacy turned to emancipation only in desperation, Winik needs to provide more proof than a few quotes from the hypocritical General Lee. Winik's neglect of race and the Civil War has been noted in other reviews, but it's also somewhat spurious to show only examples of those slaves who were willing to fight for the Confederacy. Certainly the slaves who ran away to the North during the war vastly outnumbered those who offered to take up arms for their former masters. Does that not mean something?<br />Winik's prose wanders all over the page. Large chunks feel like filler. Other reviewers have given examples of poor prose. Let me add an example of Winik's strange fascination with gore, from a passage intended to describe the condition of the South in April 1865: <br />\\"Here and there, dismembered corpses lie scattered about, their stinking, bloated remains eviscerated by rats and scavenger birds, their decaying flesh staring up at the stars at night...\\"<br />Putting aside the wonder of a dismembered corpse \\"staring\\" at stars, does anyone think that the entire South was littered with bodies? Of course not. It's a classic example of hyperbole, exaggeration with no discernable purpose. It's just plain poor writing.<br />In my reviews, I tend to be harsher on non-fiction than I am with fiction. Especially on books covering crucial moments in our nation's history, and books that comment on today's social milieu. \\"April 1865\\" earns especial condemnation because it is largely a political book. Written by a careerist political functionary, this book seems to be an apologist tract for the slaveholding history of the South. In my opinion, it does not make good history to avoid or downplay the ugly realities of American history. I don't mean to single out the South for condemnation - northerners have plenty to be ashamed of, including providing the shipping and capital to obtain slaves - but it seems popular in certain circles to divert attention from the South's racist origin. Let's not forget that the people living in the South today are not responsible for slavery, but let's also not over-glorify those who fought in its defense.	2003-01-18

A giant, powerful bureaucracy with an unpredictable and omnipotent authority figure. Surreal events. Undefined desire.<br />Sound familiar? It's Kafka!<br />The book was well-written, sparse, tense, bleak, but...somehow it feels redundant and passé. It doesn't feel genuine. It doesn't feel real - yes, it's an allegory, I understand that, but allegories feel real because they create a surreal or overly real universe that connects to the reader's current condition. Yes! you say, as you read, By golly!<br />To me, today's culture isn't threatening us with bleakness, boredom, and alienation. We're not estranged from our humanity by drudgery, by huge, faceless nameless government organizations.<br />No. Today we are in danger of saturation. We are bombarded daily by brain candy. There are more movies, books, magazines, and games now than ever before. There are computers and the Internet. There is fast food, online food, supermarkets, and mini-markets. Every individual need is catered to. We are alienated by our distractions.<br />In that light, books like Lem's \\"The Futurological Congress,\\" Vonnegut's \\"Cat's Cradle,\\" and DeLillo's \\"White Noise\\" do a much better job of commenting on our culture, our values.<br />But Saramago's a good writer.

There is a long-standing conflict between art and popular consumption. On one hand, a novel replete with artistic vision can alienate a reader. On the other, a novel devoid of artistic experimentation and philosophical exploration leaves a reader flat, akin to eating Pop Rocks for dinner.<br />In a recent essay, Jonathan Franzen wrote:<br />\\"Think of the novel as lover: Let's stay home tonight and have a great time. Just because you're touched where you want to be touched, it doesn't mean you're cheap; before a book can change you, you have to love it. Or the novelist as the cook who prepares, as a gift to the reader, this many-course meal. It's not all ice cream, but sautéed broccoli rabe has charms of its own.\\"<br />The question then: does \\"Autumn of the Patriarch\\" succeed in giving us enough to enjoy as a balance to the artistic experimentation Garcia Marquez doles out in staggering quantity?<br />I say no.<br />\\"Autumn\\" is a painful read. Literally. Sentences that go on for pages. No paragraph breaks. A handful of chapter breaks. This book will hurt your eyes, cause eye strain, there's no resting place.<br />Admittedly, there is much to like within \\"Autumn\\"'s pages. The detail of Garcia Marquez' world. The complex character of the general. The cyclical plot structure that seems to wander, but really circles. If you've read Garcia Marquez' books, you'll recognize \\"Autumn.\\"<br />But then...why? Why create such a difficult style? What's the purpose? I've always felt that if an author deviates from standard story-telling she'd better have a good reason. And there are plenty of examples of successful \\"artistic\\" texts.  Saramago's \\"Blindness.\\" Woolf's \\"The Waves.\\" Heller's \\"Catch-22\\" and Vonnegut's \\"Slaughterhouse 5.\\"<br />Is the cyclical, surrealistic nature of Garcia Marquez enhanced by its style? If we look at other, similar texts written by the author, we see that's not the case. \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude,\\" for example, shares a similar theme and plot structure as \\"Autumn,\\" but includes a more standard structure, and I think all would agree that there's nothing lost there.<br />Ultimately, \\"Autumn\\" feels like an authorial experiment, even a challenge, an attempt to shed readers in the wake of suffocating popularity. \\"Can I do this?\\" Yes, he can. \\"Should I do this?\\" It's his book, but I don't have to laud it.	2002-10-07

So uneven, so blurry and ephemeral in plot and character, but containing a scene or two of exquisite beauty and skilled craftsmanship...  What do you say?<br />\\"This book was a work of genius.\\"  The early scenes of Paris as imagined by a boy listening to stories his grandmother weaves - think of the depth and complexity of creating point of view, setting, and character that this scene entails.  And Makine pulls it off.  Paris feels...unreal, like a child's fantasy.  Makine plunges into this fantastic Paris as if it is the story.  As a result the reader's images, too, become tangled and unsure, and the reader, too, becomes entranced by Parisian fairy tales.<br />\\"...overwritten, vague, and pretentious.\\"  Yup.  The book features your typical first-year college writing class protagonist.  You know the type.  Emotionally blocked.  Self-obsessed.  Absolutely passive.  Self-pitying.  A bookish nerd, dissed by the cool kids in school because he's too sensitive.  The kind of character that should be drop-kicked.<br />\\"...an homage to Russian and France...\\"  Y-e-e-s.  And no.  Anything to do with the grandmother is gold.  Her descriptions of France as imagined through her grandson, the story of her travel through Russian during the Civil War, seeing her walk along the train tracks by her house on the Russian steppe.  Yes.  Otherwise...no.  We learn nothing new about Russia here, most of the platitudes written by our simpering protagonist are romanticized, overblown, and images of the country.  And those of us who have been to Paris cannot fully succumb to the images of France, especially with the image of a lonely artist clicking away on his typewriter, wearing winter coat in his unheated Paris apartment.  It's like your typical year-abroad story at this point.<br />Perhaps what ruined the book the most for me was the expectation placed upon it by word of mouth and critical acclaim.  It isn't what it was said to be.  (Lots of passiveand contractions, there.)  Lower your expectations.	2002-09-26

According to Miriam-Webster, an epic is something \\"extending beyond the usual or ordinary especially in size or scope.\\"  In every sense of the word, this book is an epic.  At times, the book travels into unnecessary spaces, gives us plot lines and characters that really don't go places.  It's long.  Very long.  The prose is epic, too.<br />But you know?

US	49575877	R1016K75ISRGVN	1902593022	319129311	You Can't Win	Books	4	45	52	N	N	Underworld figure talks up prison reform	\\"You Can't Win,\\" is an entertaining romp through the underworld of the American West at the beginning of the twentieth century, although the book masquerades as an anti-crime and prison reform tract.  Sparsely written, yet thoroughly picturesque and descriptive, \\"You Can't Win\\" was written by Jack Black, burglar, safecracker, stick-up man, and penitentiary kingpin gone good.  Traveling through a world of saloons, mining camps, and raucous western cities like San Francisco and Seattle, Black brings to vivid life a world of the 1900s we rarely see in textbooks.<br />In the end, Black urges us to stick to the straight and narrow, rues the path that brought him to morphine and state penitentiaries.  Indeed, throughout the narrative, Black sprinkles cautionary paragraphs intended to discourage would-be imitators.  But there's such a streak of enthusiasm and nostalgia running through Black's book that it's hard to believe that he regrets most of what he did.  The stuff that he REALLY regrets seems to be what's left out - and there's a lot left out.  That period he \\"terrorized\\" San Francisco - according to the afterword - his shooting of an unarmed man, the drug business he subsequently set up in prison.<br />Black's world is extremely moral, if not above the law.  There's a strong sense of loyalty running through the book, and an ethical hierarchy, at the bottom of which lie \\"stool pigeons\\" and \\"double crossers,\\" and at the top are the reliable men who keep their word and pay their debts.  Those who make the cut, who play by the unwritten rules of lawbreaking and loyalty are the \\"Johnsons,\\" the family of thieves.<br />No wonder those literary poseurs, the Beats, glommed onto this book as an instructional how-to, not as a cautionary tale of morality.  The Beats were attracted to the underworldly anti-establishment characters, the bums, the hobos, and the fences.  In the introduction to \\"You Can't Win,\\" William S. Burroughs takes Black's message further by adding a second category in opposition to the \\"Johnsons,\\" the \\"poops.\\"  (Using a different word, of course, which won't pass Amazon's censorship.)  Either you're a \\"Johnson\\" or you're a \\"poop,\\" Burroughs says, and with a swooping unJohsonlike gesture indicts everybody who prefers work to thievery.<br />Black himself would reject the notion of casting most of us into \\"poopdom.\\"  He had great respect for honest people, even those that he robbed.  Sure they might be a bit slow, but they often plied a trade, bothered no one, and lived fulfilled.  He blamed his own inability to keep straight on some mysterious internal defect, refusing to praise or justify his violent past..  Burroughs, of course, born into a life of priviledge and wealth, and who chose to squander his advantages on drugs and self-entertainment, prefers to justify his own excesses (including the shooting death of his wife) and grab onto the title of \\"Johnson,\\" as if it were a badge of honor.<br />But putting my attacks on the Beats aside, the importance of this book lies in its examination of criminality.  What makes a criminal?  How can we keep young people from growing up into a life of crime?  Although Black provides us with few answers, he gives us the example of his own life.  He claims that his experiences in prison made him more of a criminal, and that the aggressive response of law enforcement officials to his deeds pushed him further into crime.  It was the prison strait-jacket treatment that turned him bad, that put him behind a gun, that made him dangerous.  And it was a judge's act of kindness that convinced him to reform.  In order to cut down on vicous criminals, Black suggests more leniency on first-time offenders, more job opportunities and support for ex-cons, and an end to the death penalty and other cruel punishements.<br />After meeting a man who's been there, who walked on the other side of law and order, after getting to know, respect, and like the man, it's hard to argue with that conclusion.  Those behind bars are people, not animals, machines, or rocks.  And let's face it, in recent years our prison and police system has only created more criminals, not to mention caused the deaths of hundreds of men and women.	2002-09-06

I liked \\"The River Why.\\"  And I admit that I'm not sure why that is.<br />By my usual standards for reviews, it's not a great book.  The spirituality found in its pages is the usual fluff churned up for popular consumption by amateur philosophers.  Many of the characters are unbelievable, even downright silly.  The plot wanders around aimlessly, characters appear only to vanish later on, many of the various plot lines get hopelessly tangled...<br />But it's a great book!<br />The unbelievable characters - Gus' parents, his little brother - make sense if we think of \\"The River Why\\" as a fishing story!  Of course characters are exaggerated!  It's a story!  Just as a fisherman will lengthen his catch additional inches to press upon a listener the thrill of the moment when the fish took the bait, so does Duncan prop up his characters to comic proportions to convey their reality.  Real people aren't engaging to most of us.  We see real people every day.  Heck, we ARE real people!  And we don't have a lifetime to grow to love a novel's character, we have to love them right away, by the end of the first chapter at least.  Duncan makes them lovable through humor, exaggeration, absurdity.<br />And the plot is a vehicle.  It's the river in which we catch our fish.  Its twists and turns, its loops, the tributaries, eddies, and salt marshes make the landscape colorful.  It's the natural, untamed ride of a first novelist.  Its rawness is also its strength.<br />The spirituality...all I can say is that Duncan is a mensch.  \\"A person of integrity and honor,\\" according to Miriam-Webster's collegiate dictionary.  Sure, all this talk about higher powers as evidenced by nature and fishing in particular is a sort of nineteenth-century romantic belief in the superiority of nature and natural things, and it is hopelessly optimistic, but Duncan believes in it.  For him, our salvation lies in a river and in our friends and loved ones.  While simplistic, it works.  And I admit I prefer it to your standard book-thumping and intrusive kinds of spirituality.<br />But what REALLY makes this book shine is the fishing.  That's kind of an obvious thing to say, but it's true.  There's a ton of lovely detail in this book about all sorts of fishing.  Fly fishing, bait fishing.  The history of fishing.  Fun fishing techniques.  Fly tying.  Pole making.  All kinds of trout.  Fish habitat.  Native American fishing techniques.  Reading about somebody doing something well is a joy.  Laxness describing sheep farming, Patrick O'Brien writing about sailing, Jack Kerouac telling us about hopping freight trains.  And now David James Duncan and fishing.	2002-09-03

She really is that good.  And I think it points to something problematic about the quality of primary education Americans receive that a college student would find Munro's stories too complicated for an undergraduate literature class.<br />And while I'm ranting...<br />What is it with disparaging a book - comparing it to a talk-show - because it's written by a woman, with women characters doing womanly things?  If a book is about women, does that disqualify it from being great lit?  Does there have to be a war complete with trenches before it wins accolades?  I also shy away from the term, \\"women's literature.\\"  Why categorize it so?  Some people create a new category of literature to put their women into, so that they don't have to defend them from the pinheads who mindlessly laud the \\"classics\\" tooth and nail.  Forget it!  Viriginia Woolf, Toni Morrison, and Alice Monro are great authors and compete against any male writer...<br />Anyway...<br />\\"Open Secrets\\" is an amazing book.  Right off the top, she hits us with \\"Carried Away,\\" where a small-town librarian falls in love with an unseen correspondent, only to have him die in a factory accident before she ever meets him.  Of course, that's where the story really starts.  Plagued by longing, the librarian marries another man.  Years later, she runs into her deceased lover who introduces himself toher for the first time...or is it really him?<br />It's a complex story, peopled with multi-dimensional characters.  Love is at the heart of the story, and \\"Carried Away\\" manages to both disparage and glorify the strength of that peculiar emotion.<br />I'd go on, but suffice to say, the stories in \\"Open Secrets\\" are engaging, complex, interesting, and great.	2002-07-26

It's amazing this thing ever got published - but it's still more amazing that it outsells its superior siblings, such as Kim Todd's \\"Tinkering with Eden,\\" Andrew Sean Greer's \\"The Path of Minor Planets,\\" and even Tobias Wolf's \\"The Night in Question.\\"  The exploration of why a large number of people flock to thin helpings of frosting for spiritual guidance belongs elsewhere - in a very large book, no doubt - and this is supposed to be a book review...so onward!!<br />Tsukiyama's prose is insipid.  Page after page reveals classic writing blunders.  For example, she leans heavily on clich&eacute;.  (\\"His lips were set in a tight line.\\")  Uses adverbs to help interpret dialog.  (\\"...he said irritatingly.\\")  Constructs similes from the obvious.  (\\"She stifled her shout and put her hand over her mouth like a person who was holding back a scream.\\")  Relies on a single feature to repeatedly describe her characters.  (Sachi's veil, anyone?  How often does this veil slip, fall, or wag about her face?)  This is the kind of writing that sends readers on auto-pilot, lulling them into a zombie-like waking sleep.  We readers don't have to process the words - we actually consume this book without READING.<br />Then there's the structure, which Tsukiyama decided to present in diary form.  Which is fine in of itself, but usually presents the author with certain challenges.  For example, a diarist can only write in his book if he's awake or conscious.  However, in one memorable scene of \\"The Samurai's Garden,\\" the diarist Stephan is knocked unconscious during a storm yet is still able to describe his injury and sensation of blacking out in the day's entry.  The novel is full of similar, if less egregious, violations of time and space.<br />Thecharacters are flat.  Neither Matsu , Sachi, Stephan, nor Keiko have a single irritating or annoying habit.  The main protagonist seems to lack an interior life, recording not a single personal secret thought in the diary.  No character emerges from under the shadow of their identifying descriptor - Sachi's veil; Matsu's thick, muscular body; Keiko's younger sister; Stephan's tuberculosis.  Matsu and Sachi spill their life's secrets without much prodding, yet they are both depicted as private and secretive.  Everything complex, dirty, unpleasant, and interesting is swept from the pages of this book.  There's not a single lie, duck-footed walk, penis, or bowel movement in the book.<br />The historical facts upon which this book is based are completely muddled.  What's Stephan doing in Japan anyway?  He's from Hong Kong, which leads me to believe he's an English citizen, but that's not mentioned in the book.  If he were a Chinese citizen, is it likely that he would be allowed to enter Japan?  After all, the two countries are at war during the narration of the book.  There is also a lot of animosity between the Chinese and the Japanese.  Is it likely that a Japanese would readily be known as a servant of a Chinese in 1937?  It seems unsafe and - knowing the national attitude of the Japanese towards their Asian neighbors in this time - unrealistic.<br />And why doesn't Stephan even THINK TWICE about smooching his girl?  He's got TUBERCULOSIS!  Here's what I found in a simple web search about TB:<br />\\"The TB germ is carried on droplets in the air, and can enter the body through the airway. A person with active pulmonary tuberculosis can spread the disease by coughing or sneezing...To become infected, a person has to come in close contact with another person having active tuberculosis. In other words, the person has to breathe the same air in which the person with active disease coughs or sneezes.\\"<br />Considering that a medical cure for TB didn't exist until 1944, he's playing havoc with the health and life of his girlfriend, never mind the threat to her family's honor.  But - oops! - I'm letting reality interfere with your enjoyment of the book!<br />Most people who are reading this will be irate by this point.  After all, if the Amazon posts are to be believed, the majority of readers actually liked this book.  A lot.  But I argue that your enjoyment stems from comfort and simplicity, a coddling of your entrenched clich&eacute;s about life, happiness, and existence.  But the sentiments in this book do NOT add to our understanding of life!  They're better saved for greeting cards.  Life is rotten and mean, ugly, scary, dirty, and complex.  No one is as simple, eager, honest, and good as Matsu - and thank goodness!  What a bore!  Everybody has mistakes in their past, has told lies, has wrong thoughts, and selfish desires mixed in with their good qualities -- Martin Luther King Jr was an adulterer, and Hitler was a charming dinner companion.  Nothing is absolute.  Life is a combination of good and bad, and the evolving dispute over what exactly those terms mean.<br />\\"The Samurai's Garden\\" is a hiding place, not a vantage-point.	2002-07-18

It's jarring to emerge from one story, and then be expect to plunge right into the next.  Learn new characters, understand the new basis of another story. <br />So I'm usually biased against story collections from the beginning.<br />That said, I really, really liked \\"The Night in Question\\" by Tobias Wolff.  All of the stories in this collection are crisply written, highly entertaining, and oddly satisfying despite all the missed connections, shattered illusions, and the other myriad vagrancies of life presented therein.  Some are bound to be classics.  I think \\"Firelight,\\" \\"Flyboy,\\" and \\"Mortals\\" are three such stories.<br />There are flaws in this collection.  \\"Bullet in the Brain,\\" for example, relies on an absurd and unbelievable set of character actions to advance the plot.  Basically, a theater critic ridicules an armed bank robber for showing such bad taste and robbing in such a cliché fashion that the bank robber shoots the critic, starting off the real part of the story, the synaptic explosions that jar loose a final, poignant memory.<br />But these flaws are minor.

All in all, Russo spins a good yarn.<br />But the characters are what makes \\"Empire Falls.\\"  Set in a New England ghost town (all too familiar to me, a New Englander born and bred), Russo's cast - Miles Roby, daughter Tick, aristocratic Mrs. Whiting, and a bevy of others - feels real, full of fatal flaws, self-doubts, anxiety, disappointment, and hope.  And they're all on paths of conflict, hurtling down their character arcs like runaway trains, and Russo the master switchman who shunts them from track to track.<br />Daughter Tick observes in the book that change happens imperceptibly over long stretches of time and culminates in sudden bursts of frenetic activity.  And that exactly describes the structure of the book.  Change boils up within each body like molten lava under a volcano, and explodes with a loud bang, flattening everything for miles around.<br />But Russo is a workman, not an artist.  He overwrites, adds too many flashback scenes where hints and intuition would lead us anyway.  (Plus who wants to read dozens of italicized pages?  It's murder on the eyes!)  The last fifty pages is a clutter of half-baked plots resolutions.  The prose is unremarkable, and serves only to advance plot and character.  His voice is the voice of the contemporary novel, no more, no less.<br />But as an observer of contemporary America - or at least contemporary blue-collar Maine - Russo is exquisite.  He captures the spirit of abandoned mill towns across the Northeast, cataloguing their woes and optimism, creating a timely and thoughtful picture of the present.  <br />\\"Empire Falls\\" is a fine book if not extraordinary.	2002-06-18

Character-driven.  Agile.  Beautiful.  It's a magnificent, mature work, amazing for a first novelist.<br />Written in what critics now like to call \\"psycho-narrative,\\" Greer's book displays a third-person omniscient narrative that bores into its characters heads.  It's a risky style:  after all, Greer has to populate his characters with enough detail and freshness so that they feel real.  And that he does it, not through action or scene or dialog, but for the most part through the subtler, richer stuff of the human brain and its wandering eye.  Like \\"The Waves,\\" \\"Path...\\" brings us about as close to our essential humanity as a book can.<br />\\"Path...\\" ostensibly is about a group of astronomers who meet once every six years to celebrate a minor comet discovered by their own academic star, Professor Swift.  Their first meeting to witness the comet's passing from a lightless and distant Pacific isle is interrupted by an accident involving the death of a child.  Subsequent chapters track characters who were present at the scene through their lives, failed marriages, and stormy careers.<br />But \\"Path...\\" reveals much more.  \\"Path...\\" shows us the effect of inhabiting different heads, of the space separating human objects in their orbits around one another, of the physical and emotional laws tying us together.<br />It's unfortunate that Greer's book has thus far been under-appreciated.  However, with the talent available to the author, I have no doubt as to his future successes.	2002-05-20

This not merely a good book for middle-aged women, or good instruction for girls, or any such claptrap.  To label Munro as good \\"women's lit\\" is demeaning to women and demeaning to \\"The Lives of Girls and Women.\\"  (Plus it makes men who enjoy reading her a bit funny.)  It's a great book!  In any category!<br />Munro is a master of characterization and narrative structure.  Del's description of her mother, for example, reveals:  (1) Del's feeling of discomfort at her own place within Jubilee's hierarchy and environment; Del wants to fit in, and her mother embodies the eccentric within her own self.  (2) Del's mother's strengths, pulling herself from abject poverty, putting herself through school, starting her own business in conservative postwar rural Canada - this woman evokes our admiration, despite the disgust of our narrator.  It's these multidimensional portraits that makes Munro so great - yes, a character (Del's mother) can earn our admiration, disgust, and pity all at once...<br />Then in the building of conflict, Munro ALWAYS surprises us.  Every scene is fresh, new, interesting, every culmination of conflict resolves in ways we would never expect.  Take the time when Del was being molested by her mother's boarder's boyfriend.  One day she goes off with him in his car out to the country, and we're expecting some \\"Bastard Out of Carolina\\" child-raping exploitation and subsequent weepy victim hood.  But Munro makes a left at the light, has the man simply masturbate in front of the child, who for her part is excited, charmed, and repelled by the sight and is grateful to be introduced to the mystery of the penis.<br />And lastly, Munro refuses to depict her women in the same, old tired way.  Her women are not dragged around by the hand by handsome strangers, as they so often are in movies.  Her women are not victims of rape, incest, or peer pressure, as in way too many contemporary novels.  No, Munro's women are real.  They have drive, ambition, and a deep desire to be seen as people.<br />Definitely one of my favorite books, ever.	2002-05-20

But despite the novel's failures in plotting and message, Fowler still creates an interesting book that speaks out on all sorts of interesting subjects.<br />The story is really a collection of other stories - rumors, newspaper columns, hearsay, inuendo, and imagination - the only kind of information the novel's protagonist, Lizzie, can expect to receive as a spinster in nineteenth-century San Francisco.  Lizzie becomes caught up in the apparent machinations of one Mrs. Pleasant, a mysterious mulatto who appears to have political pull and supernatural powers.  As we learn, not is all that is seems.  Fowler's conclusion - and a slap to the face of her readers - is to lambast her novel-reading Lizzie for not putting down her books and experiencing life.  That is, talking with people.<br />Kinda makes me wish I hadn't wasted my time with \\"Sister Noon.\\"<br />In the course of the story, Fowler brings up race, religion, mysticism, San Francisco politics, ancestor worship, motherhood, and children.  Above all there's a message about women, a warning against confinement and imagination, and an encourgement towards self-assertion and independence.<br />The review, sounds harsh, so I'd like to give credit to Fowler for attempting something unique.  And she does have a unique voice, despite some obvious flaws in her prose that belies a lack of editing, and not lack of writing skill.  It's worth a read if you liked \\"Sarah Canary,\\" or are willing to watch a writer engage in risky manuevers.<br />(By the way, Fowler doesn't seem to be very familiar with San Francisco.  There were a few inaccuracies, especially in describing the weather.  &quot;Swirling fog&quot;?  The fog definitely does not &quot;swirl&quot; here.  Also the scent of ocean and sand would not be found in downtown Geary -- it's nearly 6 miles to Ocean Beach from there, where the wind and fog typically comes from...)	2002-04-22

In other words  hes just like Truman!<br />Despite McCulloughs best efforts in this easy-to-read hagiography to depict him as such, Adams was neither simple nor honest, and Adams robs its namesake of his complexities and ultimately his character.<br />Some interesting points about the book:<br />Despite McCulloughs repeated assurances that Adams was not vain, pretentious, and hysterical, the letters and writings of Adams and his wife (though heavily edited and taken from questionable sources) drip with prudery and vanity.  I found the couple to be extremely unlovable, what with all the moralizing they did about their neighbors, follow revolutionaries, and politicians.  Theres a lot of stuff taking place outside the scope of McCulloughs book, and it has only made me want to find a more thorough and merciless account of the two.<br />McCulloughs justification of our nations most shameful piece of legislation  the Alien and Sedition Acts  sounds eerily like the Bush administrations rhetoric supporting its own repressive legislation cracking down on the rights of immigrants in the wake of the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center.  Surely the current tribunals and seizing of foreign nationals will be as vilified as the Alien and Sedition Acts.<br />Also, McCullough glosses over Adams role in executing these reprehensible Acts.  In Adams, the President was only a reluctant participant in the repression that occurred as a result.  In reality, he seems to have enjoyed using the Acts to crack down on any public criticism of his own administration  which seems to fit with his over-sensitive and vindictive nature.  <br />Lastly, McCullough uses much of Adams to vilify Thomas Jefferson.  Although the rumors of Jeffersons affairs with his slave, Sally Hemming, are generally discounted by serious scholars, McCullough drags Hemming back onto center stage to smear Jefferson.  McCullough also has a bizarre fascination with the state of Jeffersons finances and repeatedly makes reference to his debts, though they have little or no relevance to the life of John Adams.<br />These and other things make Adams a strange book.  It almost feels as if McCullough purposefully and knowingly omitted information and distorted facts to make his subject shine.  I cant think why.	2002-04-18
US	49575877	RMJEYANYYLBZ7	034542655X	347025400	Jackie Robinson: A Biography	Books	3	37	48	N	N	Pulls its punch	Professor's Rampersad's biography of Jackie Robinson is a book that's needed now.  It's incredibly informative about the man behind the legend.  (I think Roger Angell's blurb sums it up: \\"[the] book arrives just in time to save the man from his own legend.\\")  However, Rampersad doesn't focus much on Robinson's baseball life, and he seems to be holding back judgment on Robinson despite the opportunities to do so.<br />Before digging in the dirt, I want to say that this book is crisply written and chock full o' facts about Robinson's life.  Rampersad obviously had the full support of Robinson's widow, Rachel, and her views are constantly felt throughout the book.  It's almost told from her point of view, in fact, and thus feels like a intimate, loving homage to the man.<br />But there are some issues and character flaws in Robinson that Rampersad shows or hints at, but never fully explores.  For example, we never truly felt the force of the hatred leveled against Robinson during his efforts to integrate baseball.  There are a few quick references to name-calling, a couple of pitches thrown his way, but what made Robinson so bitter, what filled him with the hatred that so obviously ate at him later in his career?  It's implied, rather than shown, as if it were too terrible even to discuss.  On the whole, the chapters on Robinson's baseball career are woefully thin.  It's clear that Rampersad is not much of a baseball fan - including a few factual errors about the sport's rules and game play - and it's a shame, because baseball is as much about its stories as it is about its action.<br />And then there's Robinson's role as Civil Rights' leader, which Rampersad describes, but withholds all judgment on.  Why exactly did Robinson favor the Republican Party, even long after it was obvious that the GOP proved to be the party of segregation and white privilege?  Also Rampersad only hints at the acrimony and in-fighting between Robinson and such organizations as the NAACP andSLCC.<br />Presented with the facts supplied by Rampersad, it seemed that Robinson was a vain, proud, and sensitive man, who was extremely susceptible to flattery, especially from powerful whites.  It also seems that his success in baseball convinced him that he would be successful in other areas, especially politics.  But it seemed that he was over his head in that area, always a tool of the professionals, Nixon and Rockerfeller.<br />Notice I say \\"seem\\" a lot!  That's because Rampersad never states any of this outright, he only hints at it - enough to acknowledge these characteristics, but fails to explore them.  Rampersad never digs into Robinson's psychology, never explains or contemplates motivation, cause, or effect of any of Robinson's endeavors.  It's so easy on Robinson that I suspect Rampersad wrote this book for Robinson's widow - or maybe her approval of the book was necessary as part of some deal for use of her letters.  Or perhaps Rampersad was too aware of Robinson's near-saint-like stature in our nation's culture to find any fault with the man.  In any case, he definitely pulls all punches, and the book, though informative, feels incomplete.<br />Yes, Robinson was a hero.  Yes, he was courageous.  But he was also a man, full of frailties and inconsistencies, just like the rest of us.  To withhold judgement does him as much diservice as it does us...	2002-03-09
US	49575877	R1F55DHBZTKVJZ	0316769517	240702285	Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour: An Introduction	Books	5	7	10	N	N	Let's believe in this book	Is this book good?  Yes.  Some people believe that Salinger is overrated, that he props his popularity by playing at the recluse, and that if he were to continue to write in the open, his reputation would have long since diminished.  But that's forgetting about his text.  Take this book, \\"Raise High/Seymour,\\" as an example.  Admittedly one of his lesser works, the novellas within still show unique story construction, and both create a realistic sense of emotion.<br />First, the emotion.  Salinger had no brothers, and no one in his family committed suicide.  And Salinger in no way resembles his narrator, Harry Glass, in real life.  Salinger's own family was not large, nor bustling, nor eccentric like the Glass family.  But the way Salinger brings such \\"authentic\\" emotion to Harry Glass, I'm sure not a few readers have scrambled around looking for a book of haikus by an author named \\"Salinger.\\"  That speaks to Salinger's technique and his ability to make his characters genuine.<br />The construction is subtler.  \\"Raise...\\" is easier on the reader, has loads of dialog and a story arc.  What makes \\"Raise...\\" especially cool is that it's a story about the narrator's brother, Seymour - and Seymour never appears in the story!  And there's little direct exposition - that lengthy narrative discourse describing a character out of the narrative, or off-stage.  The story is created in action, in plot, in character dialog.  The reader is always grounded in the scene.  It's classic writing, and rarely seen nowadays.<br />\\"Seymour:  An Introduction\\" is a bit tougher to swallow.  An optimist would say it's similar to Faulkner's \\"Absolom! Absolom!\\" in its frantic need to get the story out, even at the expense of flow, grammatical principles, and the reader.  But Faulkner had a spooky way to get under the skin, even with two-page sentences.  With \\"Seymour...,\\" Salinger forces us to wade through Harry Glass' obfuscation to get to the good stuff, the little nuggets of concrete description of Seymour.  At best, this style reinforces the emotional impact of the narration.  It's written as if Harry Glass can't bear to dwell on his brother without doing everything possible to avoid talking about him.  At worst, it's nonsensical drivel.<br />But let's give Salinger the benefit of the doubt and call this a great book.  Not for the author's sake, of course: he's a selfish, hateful man full of demons.  But let's do it for ourselves, and choose to believe in greatness.	2002-03-08

It's not because it's \\"anti-Christian\\" or any such rubbish as that.  It's just a bad book.<br />Where Pullman had earlier peopled his novels with complex and realistic characters, these same characters devolve into robotic stereotypes.  Mrs. Coulter, for example, turns into a mommy.  But Pullman's worst character assassination brings down Lyra Silvertongue, the formerly spunky, independent, and assertive little girl who enchanted us in \\"The Golden Compass.\\"  In \\"The Amber Spyglass,\\" she becomes an analytical worrywart, and gets dragged around by the hand from scene to scene by Will Parry, like some B-movie Hollywood actress.  <br />Pullman continues to introduce new characters and creatures in the third book, none of whom are interesting or compelling.  There are the Lilliputian spies, proud and haughty just like their Swiftian counterparts, but not at all humorous.  And the \\"mulefa,\\" who vie with Lucas' \\"ewoks\\" for the most insipidly sweet and cute fictional species in contemporary fantasy.<br />And as if to make up for the lack of craft, Pullman strings us along with a continual barrage of cheap cliff-hangers, as if he didn't trust us to keep reading without prodding.  And I definitely mean cheap.  It was obvious that `Paradise Lost' wasn't the only body of fiction that influenced Pullman; he also stole gimmicks from schlock-masters such as King, Grisham, and Roy Rogers. <br />The book's ending, which I will not reveal, was overtly manipulated into place.  Pullman spent a good deal of the third book inventing random rules for his universe to keep the ending intact.  Rules, I might add, which seemed unnecessary and illogical.  (Spend too much time in another universe and you get sick?  Make too many cuts with the subtle knife and specters jump out?)<br />Bottom line:  this book stinks.  Especially in comparison to \\"The Golden Compass,\\" which may be one of the best fantasy novels of all time.  But I had to ask myself as I finished \\"The Amber Spyglass\\":  is this REALLY what Pullman strove to accomplish from the very beginning?  I prefer to think otherwise, I prefer to think that Pullman had to rush this last book because of popular acclaim for the beginning of the series, and that, if given time, he really could have written a masterpiece.  That way, I can always hope he'll someday publish the \\"real\\" \\"Amber Spyglass.\\"	2002-02-28

At times, uproariously funny, gut-bustin' funny.  Roll-around-the-floor funny.  But ultimately - that's all it is.<br />The plot:  The staff of a low-brow publications house, among whose many titles is \\"The Midnight Examiner,\\" bands together to save a porn star from a mafia boss, who she mistakenly shot in the knee.  Slapstick action ensues as the rescuers, doped up on voodoo medicines, storm the mafia stronghold with a boomerang, fishing pole, derringer, blowgun, and Swiss Army knife.<br />The characters:  A motley collection of has-beens, never-weres, and eccentrics.  Each character comprises a unique set of quirky habits and mannerisms.  There's the narrator, a polyester-clad schlep.  There's the publisher, who is obsessed with blowguns.  There's the new guy, fastidiously dressed, concerned only for his cats, and wickedly good with a fishing pole.  There's the resident graphic artist, who has an epileptic/schizophrenic condition and draws big Aztec-like women on living room walls.  And the mafia boss, who's driving anxiety is that his taste in interior decoration is low-class.  In fact, there's a cornucopia of characters, a snowstorm of maladies, all amusing.<br />So what's wrong with funny?  Nothing, of course.  However, the best humor is something more than funny.  It's a device used to reveal something deeper at stake by hiding it, by covering it up with laughter, and it's that ironic juxtaposition that strikes deep.  The best example I can think of is Salinger - the sarcasm, the swearing, the ridiculous image of a child in a hunting cap wandering around New York City.  All of it hiding the grief for a lost brother.<br />But...back to Kotzwinkle.  Funny and entertaining, yes.  Moving?  Teaching something new?  A great book?  No, no, and no.	2002-02-21

After all, a developing character is the centerpiece of Western fiction, and without development or growth, a character becomes inert, predictable, and...dull.  In a mystery series especially this danger lies in wait for its protagonist, who usually is fully developed by the end of the first novel.  <br />Owen Parry, author of \\"Call Each River Jordan,\\" avoids this trap, and this book is as fresh and intriguing as his first book in his Abel Jones' Civil War mystery series, \\"Faded Coat of Blue.\\" (If you're not already familiar with Parry, Jones, or the series, run - don't walk! - over to \\"Faded Coat of Blue\\" and pick it up!  Now!)<br />\\"Call Each River Jordan\\" is the third book  and sends Abel Jones south to visit a plantation and solve the mystery of who's behind the ritual butchering of runaway slaves.  Jones confronts his own racism, meets the enemy in the current conflict, and is continually reminded of his own part in previous butchery.  <br />The book starts with a bang, right into the midst of the battle of Shiloh, and Parry's storytelling skills shine.  The battle description is as vivid as any I have ever read about the Civil War.  Jones - and Parry by extension - shows an intimate knowledge of musket battles, and we're caught up in his expertise.<br />But more engrossing is Jones' visit to the South, because that's where Jones learns something about race and the cause of the Civil War:  slavery.  (It's refreshing to read a book that firmly attributes the cause of the Civil War to slavery.)  A remarkable confrontation, Jones against his own prejudice, which is a common theme in the series, but takes on a wider, more vital role in \\"Call Each River Jordan.\\"<br />But this book is not perfect.  While Parry is a genius at characterization and voice, his plotting tends to be forced and unnatural.  Minor characters pop up and provide crucial clues at just the right moment.  Life-threatening situations arise, and Jones is rescued from harm's way by an opportune intervention.  The typical heavy-handed \\"deus ex machina\\" stuff of lesser genre fiction.<br />Nonetheless, Parry rises above his genre and is producing quality literature with his Abel Jones series.  Can't wait for the next book.	2002-02-08

Franzen knocks one out	Jonathan Franzen is either a publicity genius or a complete buffoon.  His inane comments both about Oprah's book club and its women readers as well as his earlier promises to reinvent and revitalize American literature have created much animosity.  Right now it is nearly impossible to read or write a review of \\"The Corrections\\" without being influenced by its author and his outrageous comments trumpeting his own abilities and belittling the shortcomings of his readers.  But face it, his antics have made \\"The Corrections\\" the first book of literary merit to splash into our nation's pop awareness - without any ties to a film - since Salinger shut himself away in Vermont.<br />Did Franzen reinvent literature with \\"The Corrections\\"?  No.  In fact, Franzen's novel is not at all that unusual or important from a craft perspective.  Less audacious or experimental than David Foster Wallace or even Stephan King, Franzen reminds a reader of a Phillip Roth who writes in the third person or a William Gaddis who uses quotes.  His characters are less self-destructive and repulsive than those found in a Todd Solondz movie.  He uses time and plot structure in a more conventional manner than Vonnegut.<br />But the book is good, even great.  He's skillful, turns a phrase well, uses all the tricks and baubles of the professional writer with ease.  Symbolism, emotion, character, it's all there.  \\"The Corrections\\" is a fast read and creeps under the skin.<br />To me what makes the book are the themes.  The conflict between self-illusion and ugly reality.  The dashing of the American Way of Life, moving away from rigid and unreal Midwest values to an equally absurd set of urban rules.  Family.  Love.  Failure and success.  Personally, I loved Franzen's depiction of family reconciliation.  That moment when, as a child, you manage to realize that your parents are neither horrible nor terribly unusual.<br />But with all the hype and energy spent hating or loving Franzen, it's impossible to judge the book fairly in the immediate aftermath of its release.  Perhaps in a decade we'll know better what to think.	2002-02-06

The highlight of this book, however, are the three stories in the first section.  Starting with the title story, these three pieces \\"feel\\" real.  They all involve the same character and narrate his experiences in the Vietnam War.<br />What's so great about the Vietnam stories is the authenticity.  Not just in the description of the war, but in the emotions and thoughts of the protagonist.  Many reviewers noted the author's hard-edged voice, the roughness, confusion, and violence swirling just beneath the surface.  But what most fail to mention is the voice of longing and hope that create the foundation of Jones' Vietnam tales.  The steamy jungles of Southeast Asia have taken a tough, street smart kid and wrung every drop of humanity from him.  All that remained was a near-crazed epileptic with a detailed knowledge of boxing and Schopenhauer.  But there's a spark of life and joy that drives the narrator on, that turns him outward and gives him inspiration to write.  He's a fighter, aching to find a peaceful moment.<br />The remaining stories are raw and amateurish, containing passages of wonder, but largely unauthentic.  It's as if Jones churned these out in a writing class, inspired by an exercise on voice.  I never got the sense that he actually believed in any of these stories.<br />But the collection is worth the price of the book just for the opening three stories.  In the same league as O'Brien's \\"The Things They Carried,\\" Jones' war stories will no doubt be long considered as essential reading on the Vietnam War.	2002-01-24

Not quite in the same league as Mary Renault, Pressfield's \\"Gates of Fire\\" nonetheless depicts a vivid and believable picture of ancient Greece.  Pressfield concentrates on Sparta, renowned for its warriors and its severe lifestyle, as well as for its territorial aggression and ruthlessness.  In \\"Gates of Fire,\\" Sparta transforms into a principled boot camp for Greece's defense force, whose heroism culminates in a suicidal stand at the gates of Thermopylae against the assembled hordes of Persia.<br />Told from the point of view of a Spartan slave, Xerxes, who has risen from toil in the fields to the position of a squire, the narrative celebrates the camaraderie and élan of the Spartan military mindset.  Also consider that the narrative is depicted as a set of notes intended for reading by the King of Persia -- the Spartans' foe at Thermopylae and an feminine, overeducated ruler of a vast empire, rich and cultured beyond the Greeks' conception - which hints at a philosophical message similar to those found in L. Sprague DeCamp novels and books such as \\"The Education of Little Tree.\\"  That is, people of earth, honest hard-scrabble farmers, are always superior in character and psychology to their urban counterparts.<br />Pressfield's attention to detail is what makes this book spectacular.  Ancient Greece comes alive under his pen.  The characters are generally military fiction archetypes - the grizzled reluctant veteran, the young hot-head, etc - but done with enough seriousness and individuality that they still resonate.  Pressfield's description of combat is gut-wrenching and ultimately makes this book a page-turner.<br />But what is the book about?  Enter the creepiness.<br />Make no mistake, the Spartans were no advocate of civil liberties and freedom, as is hinted by Pressfield in the novel.  They had lots of slaves and loved conquering and enslaving their neighbors.  There is also an implication that Sparta's stand at Thermopylae paved the way for the development of democracy in ancient Greece.  Which may be true, but it was in Athens democracy arose, not Sparta.  In fact, the two cities were always bitter rivals.<br />The book seems to glorify a military-school mentality.  Hard training, ritualized humiliation, and combat build men and save countries.  The arts and undisciplined minds invite dishonor and destruction.<br />But I would argue that a strong nation is built from many, diverse elements, and that's where Pressfield's philosophy falls short.  A strong nation has poets and warriors, not only warriors.  In Sparta, however, all are compelled into military service.  Every citizen must participate in the military.  There's no freedom here.<br />Still, I give the book four stars for its excellent depiction of Sparta and ancient warfare.  A truly great novel of war, even if I disagree with the central tenets of the philosophy that glues the book together.	2002-01-10

No surprise that Dickey is a poet, too; the prose in \\"Deliverance\\" delivers an earthy, primitive pungency you can almost taste in the back of your mouth.<br />First, the title.  Deliverance, according to Miriam-Webster, is \\"the act of delivering someone or something, LIBERATION, RESCUE.\\"  In Dickey's book, \\"Deliverance\\" has a twofold meaning.  The obvious is \\"Deliverance\\" as in the liberation of the canoe party from the clutches of the violent rural rednecks.  But there's another deliverance at work here, the liberation of a man from the meaninglessness of his suburban life.  In the beginning of the novel, which many reviewers dislike but which I think essential to the book, the protagonist - Ed - describes his dull, small world.  Neither his job, his wife, or his children engage him much.  His life is meaningless and pithy.  It's not until he's emerged from his wilderness ordeal that he appreciates it all again.  He isn't delivered from his life, he's delivered from its meaninglessness.  He's found his life.<br />If this is a story of attaining manhood, then manhood is appreciating the everyday, the humdrum, and the domestic.<br />The characters, as other reviewers have already astutely noticed, represent different aspects of modern culture.  There's Drew, the dreamer and philosopher, the modern-day liberal; Bobby, the consumer, most removed from the wilderness; Lewis, the reactionary; and there's Ed, Mr. Blank Slate, Joe Normal.  Lewis gets them into the mess; Drew is slain trying to pursue the honorable course; Bobby is violated as a result of his own corpulence; and Ed picks up the slack and saves them all in an extraordinary effort involving rock climbing and murder.<br />But it's the wilderness for me that contains the most potential for symbolism.  Like Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness,\\" the wilderness is a brooding menace representing the state of nature, and theriver the steady road that leads the civilized man there.  Certainly, too, given that the novel was written in the late 1960s, the wilderness contains a political element, a connection to the jungles and rivers in Southeast Asia where thousands of American boys were encountering horror on a daily basis.<br />Is this an anti-war book?  I think so.  \\"Deliverance\\" certainly reveals the horror of combat.  And the ultimate result of the combat is a warm appreciation of the quiet.  But this appreciation can't come without the combat.  So, yes, \\"Deliverance\\" is anti-war but implies that war is necessary as well.  <br />If we remember that Dickey was a fighter pilot in WWII, this seemingly paradoxical view makes a lot of sense.  Based in the Pacific, Dickey no doubt witnessed the horror and carnage of the bitter combat on the atolls.  No doubt Dickey lost a lot of friends, as well.  But was there ever a more necessary war than WWII?	2002-01-08

While the writing is skillful, and the story ripe with well-working literary devices, including character exploration and a vigorous plot, the book ultimately feels a little flat.<br />The craft is in the narration, a series of letters and journal written by the near-illiterate bandit himself.  Carey maintains a believable voice throughout the book, a voice that occasionally manages to rise out of the page and directly into the head.  The characters in the book, too, are complex, multi-faceted, always full of surprises.<br />What makes this book flat is the story itself.  The concept of downtrodden underdog rising against faceless authority is one that is so hackneyed and cliché, that it's generally relegated to Hollywood screenplays and pulp fiction.  \\"Titanic,\\" \\"Braveheart,\\" \\"Rob Roy,\\" \\"Robin Hood.\\"  For Americans, the plot is all too familiar.  Think stories about Jesse James and Billy the Kid.  Think \\"Outlaw Jose Wales,\\" \\"The Dirty Dozen,\\" \\"The Magnificent Seven.\\"  In order to rise above the mountains of cliché, an author'd have to write an amazing book.  Unfortunately, \\"The True History...\\" is good, not great.<br />Perhaps if I were Australian, a story about Ned Kelly would have greater meaning.  I'd be more familiar with the history and a lot more sensitive to the controversy.  For Americans, I think, a story about John Brown would convey a similar impact.	2002-01-08

At first, it seems like a random series of vignettes about early 20th-century Icelandic life, full of detail and life, but appearing loosely bound at best.  But by the end of the novel, the reader realizes he is in the hands of a master craftsman as the rich detail provided in earlier chapters come back to play important roles in the culmination of the book and its plot.<br />There's an endless array of well-defined, complicated, and vivid characters.  There's the lavish countryside painted simply - evoking the same feeling you get from a good watercolor.  Then there's the plot, which is mysterious and complex, but leaves you with much to ponder.<br />A nod to the translator, Magnus Magnussen, because the prose is fertile and poetic.

The first thing you think about when you think about \\"Rule of the Bone\\" is the protagonist's voice.  Sloppy, energetic, unfocused, anarchistic, lazy, and emotional, the voice really gets under your skin.  It's a dead ringer for the voice of the modern 14-year-old.<br />The next thing you notice is how fast you're reading the book.  I finished it in a couple of days.  I couldn't put it down.  The language doesn't require scrutiny.  It's not the language of introspection, nor is it laced with symbolism and clever literary tricks.  It's the language of an exorcism, a testimonial, it's a confessional, and is rushed out in one long breath.  And it's a cliff-hanger without resolution.  The further in you go, the faster you go, desperately looking for a sense of closure with any of the innumerable plot points Banks serves up.<br />Unfortunately, not much is left.  The book ends in a totally unsatisfying manner.  Nothing is resolved.  We have no clue as to Chappie/Bone's future.  Not that literature has to have resolution to be enjoyable...but it helps.  A lot.  Especially when the plot points are as conventional as \\"Rule of the Bone's\\":  sexual abuse, drugs, runaway teens. <br />There is some trouble, too, with the plot being dragged down to Jamaica, to a Rastafarian fantasy world of gangsters, drugs, and swimming pools.  It fits Bone like a glove on a snake.  And what kind of self-respecting punk loves 60s and 70s music more suitable to an aging novelist?  Where's Green Day and the Cramps?<br />Nonetheless, \\"Rule of the Bone\\" is a satisfying book that connects with many readers.  It's a raw expose of a young mind, and skillfully done by Mr. Banks.	2001-11-29
US	49575877	R3443QWZ0URFYU	0451526295	569473707	Mansfield Park	Books	5	6	10	N	N	Fanny's a prig! Fanny's a prig!	\\"Mansfield Park\\" is a great book, and no one reviewing here has claimed otherwise. (Well, there are a few exceptions, but they're better left unmentioned.) But there has been a great clamor over the quality of its protagonist, Fanny Price. One camp has her a valiant heroine full of moral rectitude and therefore admirable. The other paints Fanny as prig, passive and odious.<br />I fall into the latter camp.<br />There are several common defensive positions taken no behalf of Fanny Price (who, I dare say, is used to having people do all the fighting for her). I've taken these positions and constructed rebuttals to them:<br />1) \\"Fanny had to be passive. She was penniless, without strong family connections, and living in a precarious position at the mercy of her guardian, Sir Thomas.\\"<br />The novelist is god of her creation. Austen created Sir Thomas and Mansfield Park, took Fanny's father and turned him into a drunk, her mother into a slattern, leaving her at the mercy of the world. Fanny's passivity and helpless situation was manufactured by the author. It did not have to be so, as evidenced by Austen's other books.<br />2) \\"Fanny's morals are virtuous and to be admired, not to be discredited. She was a strong character, as evidenced by her staying true to her principles.\\"<br />What are Fanny's principles? She talks bad about no one, unless someone she likes talks bad about them first. She does not laugh, speak on her own behalf, or like to be the center of attention. She is content with small things. She dislikes flirting. Basically, she disdains action, which she considers pushy and rude. And, indeed, she exhibited a constant stream of passivity throughout the book.<br />First, there's a literary reason why passivity fails to hold the reader. Action reveals character. A character's thoughts and speech are unreliable. It's only in the crucible of conflict we see what a character is made of - we see her make a decision and act on it. Fanny doesn't act. Or rather, her action is not to act. In literature, passivity creates a gap between a reader and a character. We don't care as much.<br />Then there's a socio-political reason, too. In a society where women could not hold office, vote, or own property, women were at the mercy of men. The Taliban would feel right at home in 1810s England, surrounded by women swaddled under petticoats and dresses, who had no rights of citizenship. Women were expected to be demure, passive, and pretty, like baubles. It is no wonder that modern-day sensibilities object to Fanny, who embodies that time's feminine ideal. Nowadays women can survive on their own. Who would want to go back? Fanny is in this light an ugly reminder of how things could be and, in some places, still are.<br />Most importantly, Fanny's passivity bogs down the narrative itself. The ending of \\"Mansfield Park\\" relies on a series of serendipitous events, none of which Fanny drives herself. First, Sir Thomas is a decent, moral character, and eventually recognizes Fanny's value, but only after a family crisis. Edmund, Fanny's love, almost marries her rival, Mary Crawford, but decides not to only after Mary botches a five-minute conversation. And none of these things happen if Sir Thomas' eldest daughter never abandons her husband on an adulterous fling. Think of the string of events that take place to create the ending! If only one of these events or characters are different, Fanny's in deep trouble! If Sir Thomas had the character of Mrs. Norris, Fanny would be on the street in no time. And while Austen constructed her book to ensure Fanny's happiness, she jumps the plot through so many flaming hoops that the end feels lame and forced.<br />3) \\"We must judge Fanny's morals in proper perspective; that is, from 1819, when Jane Austen wrote 'Mansfield Park.'\\"<br />A difficult statement that makes us question that very way we read. Should we bring our modern sensibilities to a reading of a book written almost 300 years ago? Should interpretation be based on our personal experience of the text? Yech and double yech.<br />But fortunately, Austen wrote other books, and we can judge her characters' morality not with our modern-day morals, but against her own.<br />And Fanny Price comes through like a prig.<br />One neat thing (among many) about Austen's books is the struggle in her women between security versus spirit. (Security to Austen means money.) Which only makes sense if we imagine how uncomfortable 1810s England was for a woman of Austen's intellect and profession, a woman who no doubt wrote novels desite its impropriety.<br />In \\"Persuasion,\\" for example, this conflict is embodied in Anne Elliot, who loves a man her social circle disapproves of. She turned down his first marriage proposal on the advice of a family friend, but spends her life regretting the decision. And that's what the novel is about. Regret for not marrying Wentworth, for not loving, and for choosing convention over emotion. Now this is a conflict we understand. Who among us has no regrets?<br />In \\"Mansfield Park,\\" convention and emotion agree. Which is pretty easy, actually, because Fanny exhibits so little of the latter. Fanny is spiritless. She passively watches the outcome of her life unfold before her. She does nothing to aid events along. She never laughs, jokes, or exhibits joy. I can only think that Fanny Price would be the object of disdain and pity by the other Austen heroines. And has anyone realized that Fanny resembles her aunt, Mrs. Norris? Can anyone doubt that after 30 years married to a parson, Fanny, too, will be sanctimonious and self-righteous?<br />Love Fanny or hate her, \\"Mansfield Park\\" still earns 5 stars.	2001-11-13

He's a visionary, an excellent writer, a first-rate satirist, and fun, fun, fun!<br />Stigmata's strong points:  Character, dialog.  Awesome social satire - the colonists huddling in their hovels, chewing narcotics, wife-swapping, hating their dreary lives are a natural allegory to modern-day suburbs.  Their narcotic, Can-D, produced a hallucination whereby the colonists inhabit the life of Perky Pat, a rich playgirl living in San Francisco - again, not so far removed from today's penchant for reality shows, or very much like the popular video game, \\"The Sims,\\" which allows gamers to inhabit and build a virtual life in a computer environment.<br />PKD effectively comments on the penchant for escapism in modernity, escape from the alien urban environments we have constructed to provide us with comfort and quiet.  It's the quiet and comfort that drives us to seek thrill and adventure and wonder in a drug, a video game, in TV, or on line or inline skates.<br />But PKD takes it further.  For him, thrill, wonder, and adventure are all aspects of divinity.  Having lost our natural connection to divinity and the aforementioned characteristics thereof in the comforts of modern-day suburbia, our only avenue to God is through our imagination.  And this is where \\"Stigmata\\" takes off.  <br />Stigmata's weak points:  Confusion.  Anarchy.  PKD lost me in the character of Palmer Eldritch.  I know that there's supposed to be a whole lot of symbolism and message in the plot elements surrounding Eldritch and his insidious new drug, Chew-Z.  But I didn't get it.  Is Eldritch the Son of God?  a prophet?  hosting an alien parasite?<br />Like the drug, Chew-Z itself, \\"Stigmata\\" takes off on an hallucinogenic romp that's very hard to follow.  What's \\"real\\"?  What happens to whom?  When is the narrative tracking actual events, or when is it reporting a vision?  Likely that was PKD's intent, to tweak the reality of his narration and bend the rules of reality.  It worked, but left the book - for me - a confusing hodgepodge that sputters out instead of burning fiercely to its conclusion.	2001-11-02

While the prose flowed and the pages flew by, I felt too much the politics and the semi-autobiographical style to feel strongly about the characters or the events.  <br />Despite the coldness of the book, Naipul manages to draw his readers into the setting.  Paying special attention to detail - the narrator's description of his flat, for example - Naipul paints a full picture of the African town at the bend of the river.<br />But there are too many passages of direct exposition, too many instances of characters unexpectedly changing their nature, too much that happens without explanation for this to be considered a great novel.  For example, the narrator in one absurd scene beats up his mistress in his bedroom.  We're not sure why, and we're apparently supposed to sympathize with aggressor.  It's not a case of an unreliable narrator, because there is no other evidence of such in the book, and it seems sloppy plotting.<br />In a recent issue of \\"The New York Review of Books,\\" South African author, J.M. Coetzee likened V.S. Naipul's attitude towards Africa to Conrad's in the \\"The Heart of Darkness.\\"  I was reading \\"A Bend in the River\\" at the time, and that statement struck me with the force of insight.  How true that is!  There's a sense of alieness and horror in Naipul's description of Africa that easily matches Conrad's.  In both \\"Bend in the River\\" and \\"Heart of Darkness,\\" the narrators live in fear of the awesome primal power found in \\"the bush,\\" where primitive tribes live in the same manner as they have for centuries, and who are capable of random and barbaric acts of horror.  In both books, a brutal strongman (Kurz and The President) is required to tame the bush or to direct its energies.  And in both books, a foreigner lives in fear at the borders of horror.<br />Somehow, then, \\"A Bend in the River\\" fails to unearth any new emotions we non-Africans can feel towards thecontinent.  In that way, it is a letdown, too.  What's missing is a discussion of the bush from the bush's point of view.	2001-11-02

And no wonder.  It's a powerful, compelling, and above all, believable book.  But despite Bahr's ability to write, his presentation of character, and his seeming accurate portrayal of the aftermath of a Civil War battle, the book collapses under the weight of convoluted prose and lack of action. Bahr has over-Faulknered his book.<br />\\"Faulknering\\" is a common practice among writers, especially of Southern origin, whereby much complex prose is expended, in an earthy and stream-of-consciousness manner, to produce little or no result.  It worked for Faulkner, but there's only one Faulkner.<br />The setup of the novel is amazing.  The scenes where Bushrod Carter and his fellow soldiers line up for battle are written lucidly, with a touch of humor and a hint of horror.  The details are rich; Bahr meticulously describes the soldiers' clothes, posture, and smell, provides the characters with a past and purpose.  <br />But then somewhere about a third of the way in, the book sputters.  The book builds tension towards the battle, then...the battle's over, the book skips over the battle completely.  Many people have praised the book's accurate depiction of a Civil War battle, but no battle appears in the book.  And think of it!  Think of the action and plot passed over!  The battle is the central and most pivotal plot point in the book, and...it's missing, as if Bahr shied away from trying to describe something so indescribable.<br />And after the battle, the book devolves into a series of surreal, slow-moving passages from which the majority of the characters introduced at the beginning of the book are missing.  Instead, we're left with a series of events that happen by themselves, not pushed by characters, but pushed onto characters.  Nothing in the characters of either Bushrod or Anna Hereford (Bushrod's love interest) explain why they gravitated towards one another - they just come together through the maze of run-on sentences.<br />And it's a shame, because finally we get a good book other than \\"Cold Mountain\\" that tackles the war from the rebels' point of view without resorting to pro-Confederate romantic revisionism.  The most telling details about the war are the ones that Bahr leaves out.  There is no mention of slavery - after all, the great majority of Southerners were not slave owners.  There are no plantation owners, no dashing young cavalry officers, no blockade runners, just a scraggly group of uneducated farm boys fighting for nothing - by this point, just fighting.	2001-10-24

Her characters, like Kureishi's, are an eclectic mix of East and West, and play out the mingling of cultures in their character arcs.<br />Smith's imagination runs amok in a pleasant way; in the book she features a sham Islamic fundamentalist group, an absurd genetic engineering project, an overeager suburban middle-class family, and Jehovah's Witnesses.  The characters surf their way through these groups and their fantastic conflicts as a response to their inner, emotional lives rather out of any political or ideological conviction, which provides the comedy: ridiculously exaggerated situations stocked with serious and emotionally afflicted characters.  Smith's prose is crisp and utterly descriptive.  At times, it can be moving or tense.<br />However, despite Smith's characters, the comedy, and her descriptive skills, the book is disappointing.  The characters sacrifice consistency for dynamism.  The plot skittles about like a flock of chickens on a frozen lake.  The quality of the book varies; the first part feels like the work of a novice; the middle, the work of an experienced professional novelist; the last feels rushed, as if prodded by a deadline and left unrevised.<br />Not bad for a first book.  Considering the popularity of \\"White Teeth,\\" we'll likely soon see more work by Zadie Smith, no doubt more polished.	2001-10-22

They both built personal relationships with the subject of their book, and they know the issues intimately.  They describe the Cuban baseball culture, Hernandez' escape to the U.S., the politics of both Communist Cuba and U.S. Professional Sports, Fidel Castro, and the expatriate Cuban population in Miami with confidence and detail.<br />All of these subjects are compelling.<br />However, \\"The Duke of Havana\\" is choppy and disorganized.  It reads like a series of human-interest Sunday supplements piled on top of one another.  It pulls punches, failing to effectively criticize Castro, Major-League Baseball, and the Miami Cuban expatriates.  The book feels like it's missing crucial personal information about the Hernandez brothers, as if the authors self-censored the book to preserve their friendship with the ballplayers -- but by remaining impersonal, the authors rob their book of its human element.<br />I blame the publisher for the book's shortcomings.

The premise is intriguing: an astronaut, Bregg, returns to Earth after spending 100 equivalent years in space (due to light-speed travel) and has to cope with the world he discovered, which has irretrievably changed since his departure. Bregg finds that his planet's society has emasculated itself, eliminating violence and conflict from its members using a government-sponsored surgical procedure on all humans at or near birth. The result is two-fold. First, war, conflict, greed, and other \\"violent\\" or \\"aggressive\\" vices have been eliminated. Second, everybody's a \\"wussie.\\" They dress in colorful clothes, they don't engage in any combative or competitive sports, they don't even argue. In order to compensate for his new environment's passivity, Bregg boxes, gets in fights, and carries off a woman over his shoulder. Essentially the book's core message echoes Susan Faludi's \\"Stiffed,\\" in which she postulates that evolving gender roles have left modern men feeling displaced. As a result, those who feel threatened tend to overcompensate and engage in supra-masculine activities. Of course, \\"Return from the Stars\\" predates \\"Stiffed\\" by a decade or so. \\"Return\\" also implies that the government of the future falls into the hands of Rush Limbaughian nazi-feminists who organize and implement the collective \\"snipping\\" of mankind. Bregg is hard to like. He yearns for the mythical 1950s suburban paradise where women were chaste and modest, and men strong, silent, and dressed in charcoals and earth tones. As a result, I had trouble sympathizing with the he-man astronaut and his conservative and backward longings. And in a way, thankfully, Bregg is already out-of-date in 2001.	2001-08-27

To do so, Highsmith packaged a murder mystery around the two.  As a result, something is lost both in the mystery and the exploration of the characters.<br />The two men are vastly different.  Teo is a wealthy German, reserved, cool, an artist.  Ramon is a poor Mexican workingman, fiery, tempramental, a devout Catholic, a furniture mender.  And they happened to share the same woman, who has been brutally murdered.<br />Told from Teo's point of view, the bulk of the book grapples with Teo's suspicion of Ramon as the killer and his efforts to understand his friend's mental state, which is, at best, somewhat shaky.  They travel through Mexico together, trying to chase down suspects of the crime.<br />But ultimately the book fails to deliver.  It never attains the level of tension that Highsmith usually brings to her books with austere prose and the exploration into the psychology of brutally flawed protagonists. <br />But, still, it's better than 95% of the mysteries out there.  It's not a great place to start with Highsmith, but it's a interesting if not enthralling ride on the Patricia-train...	2001-07-06

Though Ms. Shields' prose slides easily off the tongue, and at times inserts itself into the reader's subconscious, the book's protagonist - Daisy Goodwill - is uninteresting and unexplored.  Basically, Ms. Shield fumbles at narrative and plot. <br />It seems that Ms. Shields attempted to write a book in the strain of Virginia Woolf's, \\"The Waves,\\" or - more extreme - Faulkner's \\"Absolom, Absolom!\\"  These works also use a barrage of singsong or poetic prose to worm directly into the reader's brain, producing the eerie feeling that we have a link to characters' thoughts.  And, at the best of times, but only with supporting characters, Ms. Shields manages to do this.<br />For some reason, however, Ms. Shields decided to describe the protagonist by depicting everything around her, letting us discern her main character by only her outline, only the blank space left over in an otherwise bright, colorful canvas.  This does not work.  Instead of caring or involving ourselves with Daisy Goodwill, we are never left with an impression of who she was.  We are left with blank space.	2001-06-11

Greer writes well, his prose has a curious luminosity, and he has a remarkable eye for those key details that make a story successful.  His characters are complex and interesting, their arcs always surprising and always revealing, their conflicts never tidily resolved in that self-help way found in mediocre fiction.  <br />In these stories, Greer tackles the different faces of longing.  There's love, which Greer portrays as wistful, quiet, and companionable, and belonging to the realm of women.  And then there's sexual desire, which is as sharp, painful, and fleeting as a flame.  Desire belongs to men, and for men, in Greer's fiction.<br />My favorite story by far is \\"Lost Causes,\\" and that's probably because I heard him read it in Missoula, Montana.<br />If I have to find a flaw in the book's, it's the way Greer spins his plots.  Sort of mushy, vague, and overly pretty, the kind of plots typically churned out by graduates of creative writing programs.  That said, I can't wait for his novel.	2001-06-05

Mr. McCaig, in the Afterword, claims that, in the book, \\"Jacob's Ladder,\\" he attempts to depict the South during the Civil War as accurately as possible, giving his readers a possible glimpse at the way life in mid-19th-century Virginia might have been, before \\"moralists\\" and other revisionists colored history with their present-day viewpoints.<br />Pshaw.<br />As with any work of historical fiction, Mr. McCaig's book is as much a reflection of our times and his views and beliefs as it is a story of the past.  In \\"Jacob's Ladder,\\" Mr. McCaig moralizes and revises the Civil War in a way that is naïve and possibly injurious to the memory of those who fell in that conflict.  Mr. McCaig perpetuates the romantic vision of antebellum Virginia and oversimplifies the conflicts of culture, politics, and race that brought about the war.<br />First, this is not a good book.  The prose is functional, even good at times, and the plot offers opportunities for a truly deep and moral investigation of slavery - pitting, for example, a slave and his former master against one another in the lines around Petersburg.  However, McCaig's characters are flat, two-dimensional, tend toward easy resolution - basically, the kind of characters that populate television mini-series and soap operas.  Every intriguing plot point devolves into a kind of syrupy resolution where all parties understand one another's motivations, but move on, alone and determined.  The kind of resolution urged on us by self-help books and talk show hosts.<br />But then there's Mr. McCaig's depiction of slavery in the antebellum South.  If we are to believe, slavery was wrong, not because it enabled Virginians to treat human beings like property, but because it was an unpleasant obstacle to love, the kind of farcical plot device found at the heart of Hollywood's lesser romantic comedies.  Slavery, after all, was what separated white Duncan from his first and only true love, and his mother's servant girl, Midge.  When Duncan's father, Samuel Gatewood, realizes the tryst and discovers that Midge is pregnant, he sells the girl South.  Duncan is sent to the Virginia Military Institute, where he becomes a fiery secessionist, heated as he is in the passion of unrequited love.<br />The silliest character is Gatewood's field hand, Jesse, whom he purchases as a husband for his son's mistress.  Jesse falls in love with Midge (now Maggie), but never consummates his love.  Jesse is a passive, desexualized, modern-day saint.  And he runs away only to chase down his girl, who has been sold South.  It was as if he had never realized he was a slave until that time.<br />And no wonder.  Slavery, as depicted on the Gatewood plantation, was a pretty neat arrangement.  Plenty of food, good, honest labor for the slaves.  Caring and paternal guidance by the master.  A tight-knit community complete with leaders and love affairs and bawdy wenches.  Sure, there were some inconveniences: the patrollers, the patronizing manners of the whites, the frugal and Spartan lifestyle.  And, of course, the arranged marriages, the obstacles to dating, etc.<br />Basically, as shown on the Gatewood plantation, the only thing standing between antebellum Virginia and Thomas Jefferson's philosophical and agricultural utopia was the formalized and legal characteristics of slavery, not the actual degradation and inhumanity of the institution.<br />In contrast, all Northerners depicted in the book are virulent racists.<br />In this view, the Civil War ruined any chance of an enlightened and amicable solution to the dilemma of slavery.  Encouraged by hypocritical Northern propaganda, slaves ungratefully turned their backs on their well-intentioned, though misguided, Southern masters to live on their own, only to be taken advantage of by the North for their labor and as cannon fodder for their bloodthirsty generals.<br />I won't go into the inaccuracies in the book.  Other reviewers correctly point out that the South was not comprised mainly of plantations, but of hardscrabble white farmers....<br />....  Well-intentioned, too, because McCaig strives to forgive and understand Southern slaveholders.  Hey, they were people, too!  They weren't evil!  The institution was evil!  <br />But it comes across as an apologist's work, and there is no excuse for slavery in the United States.  It was wrong and had to go, perhaps bloodily.  Or as Lincoln said, \\"...every drop of blood drawn with the lash, shall be paid by another drawn with the sword...\\"	2001-05-31

If you worship at the altar of the Yankees and all their glory, you'll hate this book. <br />If you really believe that any darn ballplayer making millions, idolized by millions, can be a saint, you'll hate this book.<br />If you think Joe DiMaggio was an elegant, graceful man, a man who represented all that was right with this country before, well, before it all started to go to heck, you'll hate this book.<br />But if you heard all those quiet rumors about DiMaggio - demanding to be introduced as &quot;the greatest living ballplayer&quot; wherever he went, the money made from the card shows, the drinking alone in San Francisco bars - and you're curious about what the real DiMaggio was like, you'll love this book. <br />The real DiMaggio enjoyed the worship, but didn't trust anyone, no one. He had pride, all right, fierce pride that caused him to forever turn his back on his closest friends without a word of explanation. The real DiMaggio was a cheap son-of-a-gun who stashed money under his mattress, never paid for anything, because he was the great Joe DiMaggio. The real DiMaggio drank like a fish, smoked like a chimney, fooled around like a tomcat. He was mean, petty, full of rage, hated his contemporaries (Ted Williams! He called Ted Williams a &quot;meathead&quot;!), hated anything not to do with him and his life.<br />But the real DiMaggio was a hero, too. Boy, could he tattoo the ball. Since reading the book, I've dug up old footage of him hitting, and he has a sweet swing like you've never seen. The follow through! So elegant! All his energy - wham! - an explosion! But smooth. So smooth, you can't compare it, no one's got a swing like that.<br />And he wanted to win. He carried his team. When DiMaggio was hot, the Yanks were hot. Nine World Series titles in 11 years. A 56-game hitting streak, an effort so phenomenal that Stephan Jay Gould claims it's the only feat of athleticism where human willpower rose above the laws of physics.<br />And his fame createdthe mean, petty, penny-pinching, lecherous drunk. We did it to him. We idolized him, we followed him around, we asked him for his autograph, we bought him dinner, fer goodnessakes, it's Joe DiMaggio! Whaddya do? Let him pay for his own meal? We rose him above us. We elevated him to the status of a god. Immortals don't act according to earthly morals.<br />Cramer catches the man clearly. Some critics have accused Cramer of ripping DiMaggio, of fabricating DiMaggio's feelings and thoughts and emotions. These critics bristle at Cramer's style of biography, this new style of inhabiting the subject's mind and writing a dialog for all to read. After all, how can you really tell what a guy was thinking?<br />I admit Cramer goes overboard. For one, he's obviously obsessed with Marilyn Monroe. I mean, the guy literally hops into bed with her. Check this passage out:<br />\\"...and there she was, his girl, so pale, past vanilla, it was white in her young skin - dairy milk - and perfect, tiny-boned, delicate, like a twelve-year-old virgin, childlike as her giggle when he grabbed her...\\"<br />What the heck? Cramer goes way overboard like this mainly with Monroe. The guy describes her naked like a half dozen times in the book, lovingly follows her around even when DiMaggio was out of the scene.<br />But Cramer believes, and depicts here, that Monroe was Joe's greatest emotional influence. Joe was crazy about Monroe. Joe was devastated when she died - they were supposed to remarry in a few weeks. She was the only other person who could understand what it was like to be as famous as Joe DiMaggio.<br />So Cramer violates the traditional constraints of biography. So he sullies the image of a Great American Icon a tad, muddies his shoes. So what if Cramer looks like a total loser on the back cover of his book? He sparks interest in the Yankee Clipper. After all, if this lifelong Boston Red Sox fan suddenly starts looking up old DiMaggio footage just to see his swing, checks out the stats from his teams in the `30s and `40s, and takes an interest in the man because of this book, then it must be a worthwhile event and a work that honors the man that was DiMaggio.	2001-05-16

I thought to myself when I pulled \\"Faded Coat of Blue\\" out of my Christmas stocking.  You must be joking, surely.  Talking about marketing to a niche.  You'll get both the Civil War buffs and the mystery lovers.  This guy's gonna make a mint, but his book probably stinks.<br />So I finally read the thing...and...it's great!  It doesn't stink!  This is a good, well-written, well-researched book with interesting characters and some depth, despite all the thriller junk!  I hope Parry - or whoever he really is - does make a mint!  This is a rare crossover book, combines low-brow thriller plot with high-brow character development.<br />Normally I dislike mysteries and thrillers.  The plots are homogenous.  The characters too stereotypical.  And \\"Faded Coat of Blue\\" does suffer somewhat from these deficiencies.  C'mon, the guy's a nobody and he meets General McClellan AND Abraham Lincoln!  He witnesses the last meeting of McClellan and Scott, like some sort of \\"We Were There\\" book!....<br />But Captain Abel Jones makes up for the book's deficiencies.  The book is told from a first-person standpoint, an unreliable narrator with a rich and complex past he's ashamed of, which leaks out during the course of the book.  Filled with contradictions - the loving husband and professional soldier, the pious Samaritan and cold-blooded killer - aching with emotional conflicts - duty versus domesticity, etc. - Jones unveils the details of the story's murder along with the details of his life, both stories are intertwined and interdependent.  Great characterization, this.<br />The book also feels authentic.  Jones' voice feels like that of a 19th-century Welshman.  Historical characters that appear in the book feel like their historical selves, contain the contradictions their actual selves contained.  Parry also manages to capture the feel of Washington DC with all its corruption and decay.  I found only one overt historical inaccuracy, that of Thanksgiving, whichwasn't a national holiday until after the Emancipation Proclamation.<br />Can't until the sequel hits paperback.	2001-04-30
US	49575877	R3FQTN7BBU4HUD	0020306652	778679666	Ball Four: Twentieth Anniversary Edition	Books	4	23	27	N	N	Baseball classic	When &quot;Ball Four&quot; was published in 1970, Jim Bouton was attacked by players, sportswriters, and the owners for revealing the secret, sordid underbelly of professional baseball. Which should be enough right there to get you to read this thing. But in &quot;Ball Four,&quot; Bouton also reveals the humanity of baseball, the fear, the hate, and the fun, which makes it one of the classics of baseball literature and a must read.<br />Basically, &quot;Ball Four&quot; is a diary of the 1968 season written by a journeyman middle-relief knuckleballer. Before injuring his arm, and turning to the knuckleball, Bouton was a fireball pitcher for the New York Yankees. In his rookie season in 1962, Bouton won two games for the Yanks in the World Series. He played with Mantle and Ford. Then his arm went dead, and he found himself back in the minors, where he taught himself to throw the knuckler. The Yanks didn't think much of him anymore and traded him to the expansion Seattle Pilots (which left Seattle after a single year for...get this...Milwaukee), where he earned a spot as a spot starter and mopup long relief man. <br />The book reveals the personalities of the players and managers and owners. It tells what the players do on the road, in the bullpen, in the minors. It reveals the petty nature of the coaching staff, who are usually all old-time baseball men, not very clever, not prone to trying new ways. It talks about the dicey contract negotiations by players in the days of the reserve clause, when average players made an average wage.<br />Bouton travels in the world of boys. The players are mostly kids in their 20s, not educated, and spent their formative years in baseball. They like pranks. They like women, but they don't know either how to talk about them, or how to talk with them. Most of the time, they just try to look up their skirts. They drink. They sneak in past curfew. <br />But Bouton also works in a competitive business market. Pitchers hide their arm injuries for fear of being sent down. Players fume over bench time. Coaches think small, because to be creative and new means being out of a job. And baseball is all these guys have. They have nothing else to turn to.<br />Certainly in light of recent ballplayer behavior - think of the Pittsburgh cocaine scandals, Strawberry and Gooden, and the thuggish, drug-addled violence associated with football and basketball - &quot;Ball Four&quot; depicts a harmless and almost nostalgic view of baseball. But it still stands as a baseball classic for its honesty, its authenticity, and you wonder how much has changed since 1968.<br />In the end, the players, owners, and writers should have celebrated the publication of &quot;Ball Four.&quot; Sure, it did spawn a string of subsequent tell-alls, and it did forever swing aside the curtain shielding the ballplayer from public scrutiny, but this is a modern age, and we want heroes with all their flaws. Who is it more fun to root for on the field, a straw dummy propped up by a marketing machine, or a man?	2001-04-23
US	49575877	R2FCMDV0EHR1SU	0345410246	754283812	Iowa Baseball Confederacy	Books	4	6	9	N	N	book was real whack	Did you like &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;? C'mon, admit it. So it was corny: &quot;Is this heaven?&quot; &quot;No, it's Iowa.&quot; So it starred Kevin Costner - but at the time &quot;Water World&quot; was still years away. C'mon, admit it, it got to you. It made you want to drive across the country to go to Fenway. It made you wish you lived in a big, rambling farmhouse complete with an all-star team of ghosts. It made you pine for those days you played catch with your dad, especially if those days never existed, especially if your old man was a bumbling drunk, or, hell!, you never even had an old man. <br />Well, the movie was based on another Kinsella novel, &quot;Shoeless Joe,&quot; and if you strip away the Hollywood from the film, you get an idea of what &quot;The Iowa Baseball Confederacy&quot; is like: tangled family mysteries unraveled by baseball gap in the space-time continuum...<br />In &quot;The Iowa Baseball Confederacy,&quot; Gideon Clark possesses the memory of a baseball league - the Iowa Baseball Confederacy - that no one else has ever heard of, that appears in no written record. Clark remembers boxscores, he remembers batting averages, players' names, umpires, the founders of the league. And he remembers that, in 1908, the Chicago Cubs were to visit Big Inning, Iowa, to play the assembled Iowa Baseball Confederacy all-stars.<br />Clark's knowledge of the league was passed on to him by his father at the time of his death, being struck by a line-drive foul ball at Milwaukee's County Stadium. Clark is obsessed by his knowledge of the Confederacy and the outcome of the game played with the Cubs. He relentlessly searches for records of the league, until one warm, moonlit night on the anniversary of the game, he is magically transported to Big Inning, 1908, to the eve of the game...<br />The story really begins churning from there. It involves a 300-year old Indian, a farmer's daughter, a flood, and the ballgame, which lasts 2614 innings.<br />Kinsella is the United States' foremost practitioner of magical realism. (Especially odd, given that he's Canadian.) He transforms the details of everyday, mid-American life into a mythic and magical experience. Naturally, baseball sits at the center of Kinsella's national myth. What other early American institution has remained as constant to us as the game of baseball? What other common American element has so much history, tradition, myth, and magic?<br />So baseball novels are hard to write. They end up sounding cornball. But Kinsella is a helluva writer. He wisely avoids trying to recite a realistic baseball story (what could be more fantastic and corny than a real baseball story?), and instead exaggerates, plays, tinkers, and explodes baseball like some deranged dad building a surreal model train world in his basement out of paper mache. Sure it's goofy. Sure it's sentimental. Sure it doesn't make a whole lot of damn sense when all's said and done. But it's a nifty read, and a quick one, too.	2001-04-23

I found it to be quite dull, actually.  It reminded me of Updike's \\"Run, Rabbit, Run,\\" or Joyce Carol Oates' \\"Them,\\" two other stale indictments of American suburban life.<br />I know scads of readers love Updike's Rabbit novels - and it's apparent by the glowing reviews of \\"Revolutionary Road\\" that scads also love Yates' work - but I find novels about suburban couples engaged in suburban angst and turmoil to be quite boring.  Sure, the conflicts resonate with us:  most of us struggle constantly with the image of ourselves, feel the biting pangs of self disappointment.  But the characters in these books go nowhere with their conflicts.  Whatever happened to the strong, interesting character?  The original suburban angst books, Bovary and Karenina, at least serve up a steamy dish of feminine sexuality, hinting at a passionate - and quite human --  underbelly in an otherwise orderly-seeming existence.<br />\\"Revolutionary Road\\" is primarily about Frank Wheeler, a self-inflated and self-proclaimed intellectual who works in the marketing department of some faceless corporation.  He lives with a babely wife, April, in a little white house in the suburbs of New York.  There's also children in the picture.  Frank says he hates his job; April hates being a housewife and wants to move to Europe.  In the end, Frank's cowardice and increasing interest in his job combine with a new Wheeler on the way to pin the two to their meaningless, dull little lives.  Hijinks ensue: adultery, heavy drinking, death, brown-nosing, visits from a madman, a little jazz, and some extended babysitting.<br />Okay, I'm going to reveal the ending now, so turn away if you don't want to see:  April basically offs herself in the end, because she can't deal anymore.<br />I hate this silly ending.  No central character makes any adjustment at all during the book.  April is the only character with any hope of changing, with any hope orvision for the future, and what happens?  The first obstacle in her path leads her to suicide.  Basically, it indicates that the writer couldn't imagine his way out of the conflict, and reflects lazy plotting.<br />Oh well.  You will hate this review, surely, because you're in love with the book.  I'm sorry.  I freely admit that my expectations projected onto the book led me to my disappointment.  I also admit that I am prejudiced against the suburban angst book, perhaps because it's a bit too close to home for my own comfort.  But there are dozens of excellent examples of better books touching on the same topic, from Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.,  to Don DeLillo.  Even Kerouac had something interesting to say about the human condition bent under the wheel of conformity...	2001-04-18

Conjuring fear, anxiety, sadness, and joy through the prisim of laughter, Sapolsky's book managed to be both hilarious and poignant.  It's a personal account, interweaving a patchwork of observations on Africa, baboons, and primate nature in a series of essays based on Sapolsky's experience studying a troop of baboons in Kenya.  The book illustrates both his work with the animals and his experience as a New York City naturalist in the heart of Africa.<br />Loosely organized around the life cycle of a male baboon, \\"Memoir of a Primate\\" constantly compares Sapolsky's life with those of his subjects.  And it's no wonder, as the author delightfully paints his subjects in anthropomorphic colors, going to far as to give the baboons Old Testament names, to make friends in the troop, and, more tragically, to fall in love with a doomed female.<br />Sapolsky's rites of passage occur on the fields of Africa, as he injects himself onto a foreign culture he is utterly unprepared for.  On his first day in Kenya, he is swindled no less than three times.  As he spends more time in Africa, he becomes a member of the community of park rangers, local herders, tourists, farmers, and naturalists that border Kenya's national parks.  He extends his territory, poking into the Sudan and Uganda, travelling in Ruwanda to visit Fosse's apes.  And finally, he is psychologically sheared from his tribe through an outbreak of a preventable disease.<br />I wish, however, that the Sapolsky had more carefully described his experiences to us.  He never described his initial foray into the bush, the first meeting with his subjects, his first days living in Africa.  We also learn about baboon behavior only in passing, never get an adequate description of an animal, nor do we fully understand what he was studying and why.  The book also jumps around time and place, major characters (such as his wife) are oftentimes relegated to obscure passages in what must be an attempt to protect their honor.  And at one excruciatingly annoying literary moment, Sapolsky admits that he made an incredibly stupid mistake while in Uganda that placed him facedown on the pavement with several automatic weapons pointed at his head, but never reveals what that mistake was.  Apparently, he was too embarrassed.<br />But overall, the book overcomes its flaws.  This is not a book that rests solely on its prose, this is no \\"Heartbreaking Work...\\" or \\"This Boy's Life.\\"  Instead, it's an endearing work of humanity - or perhaps better, of \\"primatity.\\"  Sapolsky is a mensch, and he illuminates life with a grin and a tear.<br />(By the way, what's up with the Amazon review?  It focuses on Sapolsky's anecdotal recollection of Diane Fosse, as if that were a major component of the book.  In actuality, it's just a small observation made by the author from a personal experience, and has little to do with the themes raised by his book.  Drives me nuts when reviewers bring personal agendas to the table when writing a review of a book.  It's bad writing.)	2001-03-21

Is it correct?  Who knows?  It's a theory, and an elegant one.<br />Basically, the book boils down into that old anxiom about the monkeys at typewriters, that if you get enough of them together for enough time, one of them will type the complete works of Shakespeare.<br />You'll hear people claiming the book is \\"political\\" or \\"flawed.\\"  And it is, to some extent.  But Diamond effectively backs up his major points with convincing data, enough to force us to consider his points.<br />However, some critics go so far as to claim that Diamond doesn't consider culture or politics as factors in technological advancement.  This is patently untrue.  Diamond stresses the cultural and political factors in population advancement.  Those populations with more resources, larger numbers, and more time had the ability to develop sophisticated cultures capable of supporting inventors, artists, and politicians capable of making great changes.<br />Other critics cite biological differences in humans, saying that Diamond purposefully ignores these differences.  This might be true, but not important.  After all, if all humans evolved from a common set of ancestors, how could biological differences evolve apart from environment?  Again, place and time trumps.<br />Naturally, the book's loudest opponents are those who feel threatened on a personal level by Diamond's thesis.  Those who want to cherish the accomplishements of their ancestors.  Those who feel that political systems are the result of the character of the people .....  Those who feel comforted by the color of their skin.	2001-03-19

Like some Phillip Roth character, he's a self-absorbed, hurtful, egoistic bastard who tromps all over others, fully cognizant of his effect on others but strangely detached from the results.  Coetzee makes us follow Lurie, we have to inhabit his mind.  And it's an ugly place to be.  Basically, Lurie loves himself only as an obsessed self-hater can.  It's like his ego feeds off of the damage he does to others around him.<br />As a result, I had a hard time liking the book on a personal level.  But I recognize the book's greatness, I realize that Lurie's character is essential to the story, makes the book as haunting as it is...	2001-03-15

Basically, according to Brechin, a moneyed oligarchy destroyed the regional environment, poisoned our streams and wetlands, steered us towards a consumerist society dependant on fossil fuels and highways, provoked war, dumped toxic waste in workers' neighborhoods, and bought and control all significant media, all in order to make a buck.  All the problems plaguing our modern society-poverty, crime, pollution, materialism-stem directly from the path of our greedy, imperial, and disgusting past.<br />Well researched (with occasional holes better filled by other reviewers), with plenty of gruesome anecdote and illustration, the book made my skin crawl, turned my belly aflame, and made me grit my teeth each morning as I read it on the Muni.  All the passing sight from the train was just evidence of Man's greed and selfishness.  What's worse, it only reminded me that the pace of our development only increases here in California.<br />But while Brechin was quite skillful in revealing the underbelly of San Francisco's past, his tone is grating and incessant.  The book is like that obnoxious friend we all have who's politically savvy and unduly righteous.  Reading the book is like being backed into a corner by this friend at a party and having to listen to all the products you should be boycotting.<br />And what was the alternative, after all?  Certainly not the agricultural-philosophical town Brechin rhapsodizes about in the introduction.  Jefferson extolled the same type of society, but his model needed slavery to uphold it, as did the Greeks', who Brechin praises as the ideal.  So, after putting the book down, we'releft with acrid taste in our mouths, yet no refreshing alternative with which to cleanse our palate.	2001-03-13

Both \\"Tintin\\" and \\"Krazy Kat\\" flirt with postmodernism.  Both Tuten and Cantor soak their characters in a philosophical bath.  And most notably, both authors suggest a ripe and healthy sex life would serve as the tonic for the comic characters' incompleteness, flatness.<br />Why do this to \\"Krazy Kat?\\"  Who can tell from the insipid prose Cantor offers up in this confusing, frustrating novel?  Although there were some humorous scenes in the book (notably the image of comic strip characters creating a terrorist organization in order to win the rights to themselves from Hearst), generally the book was weighed down with too much Freud, too much babble, too much abstract.<br />And it's nothing like the comic strip, \\"Krazy Kat,\\" which was sparse, mostly silent, and dreamlike.  Sure it had surrealistic scenery and an ambiguous plot, but it defied explanation, and that was where its beauty lay.  Cantor, apparently oblivious to the strip's finest quality, proceeded to trample over its delicate balance by overanalying.<br />Don't think.

On the cover of my copy of \\"Hanta Yo,\\" there's a handsome Native American man holding out a pipe, and over his shoulder stands an upright, proud, and cute woman.  On the back cover, the book blurb highlights war and \\"sexual initiation rites,\\" like it's some kind of North American \\"Clan of the Cave Bear.\\"<br />Good news.  \\"Hanta Yo\\" is not \\"Clan of the Cave Bears.\\"<br />Instead, it's like some sort of Native American \\"Pilgrim's Progress\\":  a book that defines a culture's values by embodying those values in a fictitious character by the name of Ahbleza, a Shirtwearer and symbolic embodiment of Lakota tradition and values.  \\"Hanta Yo\\" is the story of his life and his band, the Mahto, and his nation's demise in a whiskey rampage at a whiteman's tradingpost.<br />The book feels like a very authentic depiction of Lakota life in the early 1800s.  The level of detail is amazing, showing all aspects of life, from hunting, child-rearing, domestic chores, to correct social graces.  But all told from the perspective of Lakota viewpoint, using Lakota expressions and judgement.<br />What seems most authentic about the book is that, while it obviously is trying to venerate the culture, it doesn't hide the negative aspects of Lakota life.  Characters are violent, stubborn, vain, greedy, and full of hatred.  Women are severely oppressed, sometimes passed from husband to husband, and have little or no say in tribal matters.  Children and animals are roughly treated.<br />The final scenes of the beginning of the end of the traditional Lakota nation were especially wrenching.  As the Lakota drank themselves into a frenzy at a tradingpost, they began to turn crazy, acting like fools and fighting among themselves, raping their own women, and murdering the traders.  It was as if they threw away all of their traditions in one orgiastic moment of self-destruction.  But more importantly, the book held the Lakota responsiblefor their own behavior, and, in the end, for their own downfall.	2001-02-22

It's heavy on the preaching of workingman values, uses characters to convey belief in that awkward way you see in blatantly political novels, and it ends abruptly and unsatisfactorily, as if Steinbeck were racing against a deadline.<br />But it's refreshing to read the novel in light of today's capital-dominated society.  While the poor get steadily poorer, and the rich richer, Steinbeck's message still resonates today.  Steinbeck's characters fight barehanded against orchard monopolies and their collected police and vigilante forces armed with guns, tear gas, and money.  The Red agitators at the center of the story spark the day laborers' fear and anger and incite a strike, which brings the men together brandishing hope instead of guns.  We could take a lesson from the Depression-era strikers and demand a fairer, more just society, one they so obviously failed to win for us.<br />Though stiff and ragged as it is, the novel also haunted me as I read it.  While the conditions of oppressive capital exists now more strongly than ever, the workingman's struggle is long dead.  In fact, today's average working stiff is the guy in the novel who loves his truck so much that he won't risk it in the battle for his own humanity.  It's not until the truck is destroyed that he becomes truly vengeful.<br />So when you're blue about suburban sprawl, when you spend day after day in a cubicle working on meaningless projects, or when you watch our nation's highest offices sell to the highest bidders, pick up this book and howl.	2001-02-21

What more can I say?  (See below.)<br />Let's talk the book's flaws:  It's pretentious.  It drips with silly 20-something life-angst that seems...well...unimportant and self-obsessed.  Eggers prose often is often overwritten, overly cute, annoying.  He concentrates too much on his own thoughts, which entertain at first, then numb.<br />But he warns us of these flaws in the book's preface!  And he thoroughly disarmed any reservations I might have had for the book!  How frustrating!  How charming!  <br />Eggers can write.  The scenes of Eggers watching over his dying parents, his description of his brother, sister, and healthy parents ring true, feel electric, are as vivid as any character sketch you will ever read.  And Eggers is funny.  He's self-deprecating, honest and severe with himself.  He's obsessed with sex.  He plays Frisbee well.<br />This book is touching and annoying and funny and pretentious and electric and slow-moving.  I loved its honesty and candor.  True self-revelation is so rare in this recent memoir movement, it's refreshing to have Eggers out there.<br />Advice for Eggers:  In future books, lose the self-introspection and write dialog and scenes.  That's where your strength lays.<br />Advice for writers:  Do not attempt to imitate Eggers' writing style.  You will only fail and annoy your readers.  (I've already noticed that the Eggers reviews on Amazon are sounding like cheap copies of the real thing-this one included!.  Knock it off!)	2001-02-15

Branch makes vivid a period of history already being whitewashed and forgotten.  I did not know how violent the reaction to Civil Rights was.  I did not know how courageous the members of CORE, SNCC, and SCLC were to withstand to the torrent of abuse, threats, and violence simply to demand their rights.<br />Today's conservative politicians will have us believe that the Civil Rights' movement was a brief, aberrant moment that has passed.  But being so recent, we know that undercurrents still exist today, that the bully racists who terrorized Civil Rights' marchers are still alive today.  And with the struggle reaching its desperate crescendo around the right to vote, the voting irregularities in the South during the 2000 election seems doubly suspect and should serve as a poignant reminder that the battle for Civil Rights is ongoing.<br />Thanks to Taylor Branch for so clearly and dramatically presenting the information to me in a volume.  He has truly done a service with this book by keeping alight the memory of the heroic struggle for freedom.	2001-02-09

I loved \\"Mysteries of Pittsburgh,\\" and I greatly enjoyed \\"The Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay,\\" though with some reservations as explained below.<br />Written in a swirl of intertwining conflicts between sex, art, love, war, hope, and comic books, \\"The Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay\\" delighted me to no end.  <br />Chabon's depiction of the comic-book scene of the late `30s and early `40s feels very authentic, and his weaving of comic plot into the novel was as effective as it was entertaining.  The details of Joe Kavalier and Sam Clay's lives growing up in Prague and New York, respectively, glowed with vivid imagery:  carnivals, escape artists, tiny strong men, and Nazis all conspired into a gaudy kaleidoscope that fueled the imaginations of the two future artists.<br />But what was the book about?  It was like a series of sketches loosely tied together.  Was it about Sam's homosexuality?  Or was his sexuality just a convenient plot twist to allow Joe to get his woman in the end?  Was it about revenge? Joe's on the Nazis, Sam's on poverty?  I never could tell, and I suspect Chabon didn't know either.<br />Sure you could argue that the novel, like a series of comics, was full of soap-opera-like twists and turns, was simply mirroring the structure of its subject.  But I doubt that.  Chabon was overambituous.<br />Nonetheless, it was a great book.	2001-01-12

After all, authors pour time, sweat, and emotion into their work, which does not deserve to be answered with vituperative attacks from readers for the sake of displaying intellectual plumage.  It takes years and great personal risk to write a novel.  It takes 20 minutes and little risk to write a book review.  On the other hand, what is a reviewer who is not honest?<br />I did not like \\"A Different Drummer.\\"  The writing was stiff, the characters leaden, the plot unbelievable and forced.  Surprisingly, for a Civil Rights novel, there was not a single, powerful, three-dimensional African-American character.  Only two distinct black characters emerged in the book:  a college-educated maid who meekly throws down her education and independence to follow her monosyllabic and single-minded husband, and a corrupt minister from the North who is covered with fancy jewelry and rides in the back of a limo.  The protagonist, Tucker Caliban, was a mute automation who acted for no apparent reason.<br />The central problem of the book revolves around the main event, the mass exodus of blacks from the fictitious southern state.  The synopsis of the book elegantly sums up this central problem by describing the book's protagonist, Tucker Caliban, as \\"...a quiet, determined descendant of an African chief who for no apparent reason destroys his farm and heads for parts unknown...\\"  It's that \\"...for no apparent reason...\\" that really messes with the plot.  There's never a decent explanation for the exodus.  It's taken for granted that leaving the South will also solve problems of persecution, violence, and segregation, as if no conflicts occur in Boston, Chicago, or Los Angeles.<br />And basically I disagree with the premise of the book.  In effect, \\"A Different Drummer\\" is a rejection of the early Civil Rights movement and its reliance on educated, middle-class African Americans for leadership.  In the book, Reverend Bradshaw represents the corrupted leadership.  He's Harvard-educated, cognizant of philosophy, and a former Communist Party member (when, in the 1930s, being a Communist was cool) who sold out for money and adulation by turning to the lucrative career of religion.  It seems that Reverend Bradshaw is loosely based on Bayard Rustin, a famous Civil Rights activist, former Socialist and Communist, who organized and raised funds for Martin Luther King, Jr.'s SCLC.  And the author's criticism of the fictitious Reverend seems to be a criticism of Rustin's involvement with King.<br />Instead William Melvin Kelley calls for spontaneous action from the mainstream black population in the South.  He urges them to free themselves.  To take their humanity back.  In the book, the characters do this by destroying their ties to their fettered and enslaved past, and abandoning their present lands.<br />But why should African Americans have to destroy their current identities to be free?  Shouldn't they fight for their inherent rights as human beings and citizens of the United States?  Shouldn't they work to transform, not themselves, but their environment?<br />And who now would argue that Martin Luther King, Jr. was not integral to the struggle for Civil Rights?  Who would argue that middle-class leadership in the Freedom Rides, for example, did not help raise sympathy for the civic and social oppression of African-Americans throughout the country, throughout the world, among blacks and whites alike?  And who would now argue that blacks would be better off fleeing their oppressors and settling in the inner-city ghettos of the North than to fight for their rights at home?nts the corrupted leadership.

For months I delayed cracking the cover of \\"Blindness.\\"  After all, based on the book's description, the white blindness at the center of the story was obviously an allegory for something or other, and Saramago won the Nobel Prize for literature.  The two combined seemed a sure recipe for disaster, a guarantee that the book would be heavy-handed and awkward, top-heavy with political messages, and as wooden as a dime-store Indian.<br />But, lo!  A surprise!  Sure, blindness is an allegory; sure, the book is at times heavy-handed and awkward. But Saramago's passionate storytelling and aching humanity paces the book brilliantly.  This is a page-turner with brains and soul, \\"Lord of the Flies\\" meets Virginia Woolf.  If this book were a woman, she'd be a stunning organic farmer/carpenter with a mysterious past-a woman who drinks tea and bets the horses.<br />But I digress.<br />Saramago's prose structure, oft described as a handicap in reader reviews, is perfectly suitable to the novel.  Saramago tosses quotes, names, and paragraph breaks overboard, which effectively throws a burlap sack over our reader's eyes, leaving us sightless in the midst of swirling, dangerous drama.  You can hear voices, but you can't identify their origin.  You can imagine your confines, but only after a serious amount of groping and blundering into sharp-edged objects.<br />But simultaneously, you are the doctor's wife's eyes, and you share her pain at being able to view the horror of the blindness.  You witness the moral decrepitude of your fellow human being.  You witness rape.  You witness murder.  You watch children crap all over themselves, and feel their burning humiliation.<br />Unlike \\"Lord of the Flies,\\" even the most inhuman brutes in these troubled times show glorious rays of divinity.  Even the big lug, the ringleader, displays his vital spark at the moment of his death-which occurs at the climax of a rape.  The old woman who eats raw chickens and rabbits and leaves their bones scattered about the house like some fairy-book witch, is an object of pity rather than scorn, despite her vicious selfishness.<br />All in all, \\"Blindness\\" is a brilliant book.  I plan to go out and read more of his work...	2000-12-17

I read this book on the train on the way to and from work, and I often laughed out loud, much to the chagrin of my fellow passengers, who must have thought I was crazy.  No one laughs on the train.<br />\\"The Nose\\" is my favorite story in the collection.  It's absurd and silly.  Especially when the nose masquerades as a prominent government official, riding about town in a carriage and dressed in a cape.  Incidentally, the nose has very good manners.<br />My copy of this book also contained the story \\"Taras Bulbas,\\" which isn't funny at all, but rather a romantic epic of Cossacks in the 14th century somewhat similar to Tolstoy's Cossack stories.  Gogol's description of the time and place is fantastic awash in detail as it is.  Description of battle is hair-raising and exciting.  But Gogol romanticizes freely, and wants us to believe that these brutal, violent men embody the Russian Soul.  (Note the capitalization.)  Whatever.  That, combined with a liberal dash of anti-Semitism, laces the work with enough flaw to consider this a 2nd-rate Gogol story.<br />It's a great book and a quick read.  One of the better books I have read lately.	2000-12-06

Every book is a cry of pain and joy for the injustices and beauty of life.  Tuchman chooses her subjects carefully to convey a message to her readers, usually a cautionary tale of the abuse of power.<br />\\"The March of Folly\\" is her most direct message yet.  In it, she describes the folly of government-defined as action against self-interest despite an overwhelming preponderance of evidence to act otherwise-and how it led to several notable disastrous events.  Namely, the sack of Troy, the split of the Catholic See, the loss of the American colonies, and the policy of Vietnam.<br />But let's face it.  Tuchman wrote this book with the Vietnam chapter in mind.  Each chapter simply lays the groundwork for the material on Vietnam.  <br />The chapter Trojan Horse provides us the groundwork, the mythic case of folly we are all familiar with, and the lasting image we carry as we consider Vietnam.  <br />The Renaissance popes provides us an example of a self-perpetuating and stale system we can remember when thinking of a moribund Congress mindlessly voting appropriations for a war no one wanted.  Consequently that same chapter gives us the image of a pope throwing lavish parties for which he hired prostitutes to crawl about on all fours, completely naked, picking up scattered chestnuts with their mouths-which might remind some of our own nation's zeal in its misuse of third-world nations-El Salvador, Iran, Panama, and Vietnam spring to mind-in Cold War play.<br />The chapter on the loss of the American colonies allows readers to take pride in their forefathers' proaction and righteousness in comparison to the slothful and ignorant course corrupt, money-bought English Parliament followed, before comparing U.S. government in the 1950s-60s to those same English aristocrats of the 1770s.  This chapter later raises uncomfortable questions about the U.S. anti-nationalistic policy in Vietnam, which worked against self-determination and, consequently, democracy.<br />But by the time she arrives in Vietnam, she has stored up too much information.  Tuchman bombards us with so many facts, memos, and bad decisions that we get lost in a labyrinth.  Her prose gets bogged down.  We forget where we are in the war, every page sounds the same, and it ends up so overwhelming that it's ineffective.  It's like she's waited years to write this chapter, and has done too much research and wants to cram it all in a few pages.<br />In the end, I have to agree with other reviewers who say it's not her best work.  It is a work of passion.  And as such, it's admirable for its passion, because it all rings true.<br />PS - Ignore all that conservative/liberal claptrap.  Both sides of the political coin had their hands bloodied in Vietnam.  And if you can't learn from your mistakes, you're bound to repeat them.	2000-11-27

Here, for example, is the \\"Devil's Dictionary\\" entry for \\"Laughter\\":<br />\\"An interior convulsion, producing a distortion of the features and accompanied by inarticulate noises. It is infectious and, though intermittent, incurable.\\"<br />In \\"The Old Gringo,\\" Fuentes imagines what happened to Bierce when he disappeared in Mexico during the revolution around the turn of the 20th century.  In the book, Bierce is an old tough guy who can shoot pesos in midair, and who seeks his death at the hands of Pancho Villa, the infamous Mexican bandit.  In addition, there's a young American schoolteacher to woo, an angry young rebel general, and lots of booze and spicy food.  And lots of Freudian sex (as the schoolteacher pretends her lover is her father).  And the whole thing is written in poor stream-of-consciousness style.<br />Bierce must be writhing in his grave.<br />Read \\"The Death of Artemio Cruz\\" for Fuentes' work of genius.  \\"The Old Gringo\\" misses its mark.	2000-11-14

After all, the characters and their environment have already been covered in the first leg.  The conflict is usually well documented, and you certainly can't bring it to a climax in book two.<br />But like some other classic trilogies, \\"His Dark Materials\\" offers up a remarkable second stage in \\"The Subtle Knife.\\"<br />For the \\"Twin Towers,\\" Tolkein created a new baddie to battle.  In \\"The Empire Strikes Back,\\" Lucas performed the old cliff-hanger trick, he got all his characters into trouble and just left them there, hanging.  Dondaldson's \\"Illearth War\\" introduces a new character and, like Tolkein, barely staves off disaster until next time.<br />Pullman uses techniques from all of these successful stage twos to write a truly exciting and lively second book of the \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy, \\"The Subtle Knife.\\"<br />First, there's a new character, Will Parry.  Then there's some cliff-hanging (which I won't reveal).  Then there's the amassing of armies and the taking of sides, as the conflict introduced in \\"The Golden Compass\\" begins to reveal itself.<br />\\"The Subtle Knife\\" is a great book for a number of reasons.  First, is the way Pullman slowly reveals the workings and conflicts of the parallel worlds, making the revelation as suspenseful as the cliff-hanging action.  Second, is Pullman's gift for character.  Will is a remarkable character, a boy forced to grow up too fast, who is serious and frightened, yet occasionally shows glimpses of his youth in telling moments.  And third, is Pullman's gift of subtle social commentary, making Will Parry, for example, a murderer.  Or by bringing 20th century government bureaucracy into the struggle between good and evil.<br />Can't wait to read the third book.	2000-11-09

During \\"lockup,\\" in their cells, the men must restrain their emotions, their dreams, their expression of humanity for fear of exposing weakness in the violent environment in which they live.  Poetry offers the men a chance to reach out beyond the walls of San Quentin.  Through Tannenbaum and the other arts' teachers, the men meet Nobel Prize winners, perform \\"Waiting for Godot\\" under the auspices of Beckett himself, and publish their poems for children at risk.<br />Tannenbaum must struggle with the men's past actions while reveling in providing an outlet for the men using an art form she adores.  She also finds herself in some moments allying herself with the prison administration, with authority, against the prisoners who are dependant on her for emotional release and artistic expression.<br />The book shines when relating the poetry of the men, when we witness the blossoming of a caged man on paper.  It is then that we connect to these men from our own ambiguous cages-no doubt less confining than iron and steel-and take heart from their actions that we, too, can still soar free.	2000-10-26

Its prose is tight, cutting, descriptive.  The main character, Lyra, is wonderfully refreshing as a bold child prone to action, quick to use her wits in an intuitive way-she's a girl Ulysses.  Set in an alternative universe where everything resembles our own Earth but is very different, the Church rules the Western world, people travel by zeppelin, and all humans have their personal \\"daemons\\"-familiars who take animal shape and serve as a lifelong companion.<br />Generally Pullman fills the book with hair-raising twists and well-thought-out escapes, but is occasionally prone to using divine intervention to pluck his heroine from trouble.  That's about the only criticism I can think of, because this book is great and a must for any reader who likes to travel beyond the here and now.	2000-10-24

But GOOD schmaltzy pap.	\\"Baghdad-by-the-Bay\\" is a sentimental collection of essays by San Francisco's beloved newspaperman, Herb Caen, about the city he loved.  Written in 1949, \\"Bhagdad-by-the-Bay\\" suffers not only from the syrupy civic pride newspaper columnists cultivate, but also from postwar gush for the average joe and the quiet of the home.  But Caen has a heart of gold, and he writes skillfully and beautifully, and if you live, visit, or dream of The City, you must read this book.  How else can you cultivate memories of the city before you were born?<br />Caen's 1949 city had a train that ran across the Bay Bridge.  Its Third and Mission was Skid Row, not Multimedia Gully.  The Sunset in 1949 was a laughable trend of new development, not the only (barely) affordable housing in town.  San Francisco 1949 hadn't heard of the Summer of Love, didn't know what would happen at the corner of Haight and Ashbury, and Castro Street was just a street.  After all, ships still used San Francisco as a port, and longshoremen were busy along the Embarcadero piers.<br />Some traditions still linger:  Caen's city had a housing shortage, and traffic clogged Market Street.  Even in 1949, people called the train system \\"Muniserable.\\"  San Francisco had great restaurants and a great orchestra, trendy first-run movie houses downtown, and cloak-and-dagger town politics.  Defense attorneys slept through trials 50 years ago, too.	2000-10-23

Nah--but a fun read...	\\"Tales of the City\\" by Maupin is a fun, nostalgic romp through 1970s San Francisco. Set in the disco, drug, and easy sex days in the nation's hippest city-still coming down from its Summer of Love high-\\"Tales of the City\\" weaves the stories of several characters in gripping and fun serial fashion.<br />Maupin originally wrote the vignettes as a series of newspaper columns.  The book collected these columns together, so you can whip through the stories without having to wait for another installment.  And you will whip through this book.  The length of the chapters and the cliff-hanger prose ensures a quick read.  <br />It's a fun if not deep book.  It's especially interesting if you live in or often visit San Francisco.  For really that's what this book is:  a love story about a city.	2000-10-18

No, I'm not related to the author.  So despite the name, I think I'm pretty unbiased, although some might think otherwise after reading the following glowing review of Jay Stevens' book, \\"Storming Heaven.\\"<br />This was a great book.<br />Mr. Stevens tracks LSD from its inception through San Francisco's \\"the Summer of Love\\" in late 60s.  He artfully describes the discovery of the drug and its effect on the psychologists who first used it on their patients and on themselves.  He introduces Alduous Huxley, Tim Leary, and Ken Kesey-the pied pipers of LSD-and explains their fascination for psychedelics.  He discusses the drug's decline, its unpopularity with government officials, its abuse by \\"untrained\\" American kids, and the progressive marginalization of the drug's \\"prophets.\\"  And all the while, Stevens skillfully gives voice to the drug's proponents' vision of a \\"metal frontier\\" to be crossed using LSD, pushing human beings along the evolutionary path.<br />It is clear from Mr. Stevens' book that LSD played a major role in the fundamental changes wrought in the 1960s.  LSD tore down personal constructs and unveiled egos.  LSD gave everyday Americans a chance to experience mystical visions.  LSD gave many new insight into the nature of being.  It was a psychological drug, and explains why most of the social change that occurred in the 1960s was psychological in nature.<br />But while Mr. Stevens in his Epilogue seems to laud the continuation of psychological exploration by a handful of \\"inner\\" explorers who use a series of newly developed designer psychedelics, I think he misrepresents the importance of these drugs.<br />First, the assumption that LSD will lead man (and woman) along the evolutionary path assumes that this path is straight and pointed in a forward direction.  That is, that evolution is a natural process from simple to complex, from amoebas to man and beyond.  Instead, science now concludes that evolution is more of a willy-nilly process.  Species constantly bloom a number of seemingly useless mutations, and changes in environment conditions dictate which mutation reigns supreme.  After all, it seems that the next species to inherit the planet is likely to be the cockroach, for the cockroach has the rigor and hardiness to withstand the destruction of the planet by humans.  And cockroaches are hardly superior in intelligence or complexity.  <br />Second, is the assumption that LSD can \\"lead\\" us anywhere.  While LSD gives visions, reveals fundamental truths about personality, it doesn't change anything.  It's up to the individual in the end to enact change, to mutate.  We only have to look at the example of Tim Leary to realize this.  While Mr. Leary was turned on to the drug and believed its in therapeutic value, in the text he remained a womanizing, upperly-mobile egoist; he just traded in his tweed for buckskin, and academia for psychedelia.<br />Basically LSD is a shortcut.  It's a quick-fix buzz.  In that way, it's the ideal substance for America.  \\"Vision in a can.\\"  \\"Become a mystic in 12 easy hours.\\"  I would've liked to Mr. Stevens explore this facet of LSD a little more.  But he seems to be totally enchanted with the cosmic possibilities...<br />In any case, the writing is superb.  It's the perfect book to read to begin exploring the important texts of the 20th century bohemian movement.  Read this alongside \\"Brave New World,\\" \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\\" \\"On the Road,\\" \\"Electric Cool-Aid Acid Test,\\" and \\"Howl,\\" among other texts.	2000-10-13

Or, as the author admits as an influence, \\"The Wizard of Oz,\\" where earnest characters grapple with a land full of surrealist pratfalls like flying monkeys and intoxicating flowers.<br />An ugly, babbling woman-Sara Canary-is the centerpiece of the book.  You can't really call her a character, because she has absolutely no human characteristics outside of her physical appearance.  Call her a symbol instead.  A blank symbol filled by the perception of the characters she does encounter in 1873 Washington:  a Chinese railroad worker, a woman's suffragist, a lunatic, a frontier postmaster, and a travelling carnie.  Sara Canary falls into the care of each at one time or another, and they chase her across Washington to fulfill their imagined or manufactured obligations to their Sara Canary constructs.  (The author herself implied that Sara Canary is an alien improperly built to infiltrate Earth.)<br />At times the book bogs down in annoying viewpoints.  (I was not crazy, for example, with the suffragist's point of view.)  Sarah Canary herself can be annoying, because you want to pin an identity on her, you need to know who she is.  And you will never know.  And you know it.  <br />The author also tries to be cute sometimes by cleverly adding anachronistic references to the present into 1873 thoughts.  (The worst of which occurs when the lunatic recovers his doctor's watch from Sarah Canary's throat.  He notices it's still in working condition and idly wonders-referring obviously to Timex commercials-if he should test the watch in other damaging ways, dragging it behind a boat, pounding on it with a hammer, etc.)<br />But get beyond that.  Each character receives a unique voice from the author, and the language is compelling.  It's interesting and refreshing and a good, fast read.  I recommend it.  Go for it.	2000-10-12

He wanders up the Congo before settling down at a leper colony, where the quaint Catholic missionaries adopt him into their fold and allow him to be himself:  moody, introspective, and manly.<br />Soon, a parade of jealous fools makes him their hero, until a young woman married to an expatriate factory manager falls in love with the Artist, liver spots and all.  Hijinks ensue, and the Artist withstands the rigors of public scrutiny by retreating into stoic posturing.<br />I won't reveal the end.<br />Basically, if it weren't for Greene's skillful prose, this book would be an absolute stinker.  As it is, it earns only 2 stars.  I recommend this book only to die-hard Greene fans.  For those looking for a better Greene novel, start with \\"The Quiet American,\\" which is an excellent book.	2000-10-05

You might ask, but only 3 stars' worth of good?<br />Gaddis is an ambitious man.  At least, his prose testifies so.  Other readers' reviews compare Gaddis to Joyce, cite that his prose is difficult to follow, and are unnerved by the change in structure as the author switches from narration to legal briefs to a television voice to the text of a play.<br />I set out with trepidation when I cracked the cover of this book, although I have tackled such nontraditional texts as \\"The Waves\\" by Woolf, or \\"Mangled Hands\\" by Johnny Stanton.  I mean, who willfully sets out for a painful read?  Sure there are legions of literary masochists ready to pore over obscure texts, but I enjoy getting caught up in plot and character, losing myself in the words.<br />Here's a surprise:  Gaddis' text is not at all difficult to follow.  His dialog is superb, and he uses it so well to characterize that you need no more than a few words to figure out who's talking, despite the absolute lack of quotation marks.  And while his legal briefs read like...well...legal briefs, the other narrative breaks are quite enjoyable, especially the play.<br />Why the three stars, then?  Mr. Gaddis wrote a book no more complicated, no more revealing of human character, no more skillfully plotted than your average latter-day Tom Wolfe novel.  Why then, I ask, did he decide to abandon quotes?  Serves no purpose.  Why the dense stream-of-consciousness passages about Long Island nature?  There's little or no metaphor to glean from the Sound.<br />Other writers use an invented structure to add to the plot or characterization, just as a playwright adds a gun to a scene to increase dramatic tension.  For example, in \\"The Waves,\\" Woolf uses astructural, plotless \\"narration\\" to mimic unfiltered thoughts of humans in an attempt to have the reader literally inhabit her characters.<br />I gave this book three stars, because I feel Gaddis failed to match structure with content.  In my mind,such an error is akin to sloppy writing, or the introduction of an uninteresting character.  It stops up the flow of the book.	2000-10-02

The conflicts evoke mirth and pathos:  a  fake troupe of Jewish tumblers in WW2-era Europe, an orthodox department  Santa Claus, the insane brother of the rabbi.  But they reveal something  deep about not only faith in the modern world, or the state of the Jewish  \\"soul,\\" but something about humanity too deep for anything short of poetry  to describe.<br />Amazing stuff.	2000-09-12

Cat's Cradle is a  clever, humorous Cold War satire involving an obscure Caribbean island, a  religious philosopher named Bokonon, and an apocalyptic substance called  \\"ice nine.\\"<br />I especially enjoyed tidbits of Bokonist philosophy sprinkled  throughout the book.  For example, the Bokonist term, karass, refers to the  teams that all of humanity is unknowingly organized into to do God's will.   People in the same karass participate to help each other achieve cosmic  goals-all perfectly unwittingly.  And there's granfalloons, which are false  karasses created by people themselves, and which are meaningless.  Examples  of granfalloons are, according to Vonnegut, \\"the Communist Party, the  Daughters of the American Revolution, the General Electric Company, the  International Order of Oddfellows-and any nation, anytime,  anywhere.\\"<br />While the narrative is broken up into staccato chapters  containing references to future events, the book mainly follows a standard  timeline-basically, from beginning to end-unlike his most sophisticated and  emotionally charged book, Slaughterhouse Five.  Nevertheless, while not on  a par with Slaughterhouse Five, Cat's Cradle is an enjoyable romp into  Vonnegut's colorful imagination and worth a read.	2000-09-07

Its topics are superb, ranging from fairy tales to  cat massacres.  Darnton is thorough in his approach and writes well,  keeping his audience entertained.<br />As a result of the book's essays and  the conclusions we make about their participants, we realize that 18th  century Frenchmen were vastly different from their contemporary progeny,  yet also remarkably human.  It's the kind of work that leaves Goosebumps as  the author's arguments stack neatly into place, and a formerly  incomprehensible event suddenly becomes clear.<br />The book does have an  identity problem.  It's caught between academia and pop nonfiction.  Some  chapters are fascinating-especially the chapter which shares the book's  title, &quot;The Great Cat Massacre&quot;-others are tedious in that  academic way, citing works, exhausting every possible angle, and so on.<br />I  first read this book in a high school history class, and then recently  reread it-over ten years later.  In the atmosphere of a class, it was a  witty, exciting alternative to standard texts, and thrilled us by revealing  how the study of history can give insight into human nature.  Outside  class, however, I skipped over passages, skimmed conclusions, and failed to  give it the same attention I had in class.	2000-08-30
