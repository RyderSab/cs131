The plot and the main characters were good but something was missing.  It really didn't grab and keep you like her others did.  Maybe because it was short.<br />Widow Delcia Adams is the owner of a campground on Coree island in North Carolina.  After the death of her high school sweetheart she puts all her attention on running the campground.  There she meets Richard and fell in love.  After he leaves she discovers that she is pregnant.

When he first meets Delcia he is attracted to her and is shocked to see her daughter who has David's eyes.<br />As the story unfolds many things are revealed but many more questions arrises.  There are secondary stories that we may see in a later book.  Although many issues are presented everything comes together to make this a good read.  I agree with the one reviewer that there is not a lot of passion between the hero and herione.<br />I hope that Candice will write a story about Delcia's brother Ryan.  I really like his character and the decision he made.	2000-12-06

Mariah and Ramon were good friends.  They were there for each other through thick and thin.  Ramon helped Mariah cope with some downfalls in her life.  He also  held a secret that he loved her more than just a friend.<br />Natalie did a  good job with showing the relationship between Mariah and Ramon.  Although  I felt it drag a little with Mariah trying to figure out what her true  feelings for Ramon.  The secondary characters also help bring the book  together with another issue of interracial relationships. I really enjoyed  this book and recommend it.	2000-07-24
