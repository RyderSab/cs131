This book is a must for anyone who wants to be a 911 Dispatcher!<br /><br />The most helpful section in the book to me was the frequently asked questions in an oral board interview, how to answer these questions, and how to prepare for the oral board interview.<br /><br />MANY of the questions in the book were actually asked in my oral board interview!!<br /><br />And, having read the book, I felt confident and knew how to prepare and answer the questions effectively.<br /><br />And, yes, I did get the job.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!	2005-09-12

Also there are many B&W photos in the book.<br /><br />  One of my favorite stories was the one at the Irma in Cody, WY. The author and his wife personally experienced a ghostly phenomenon there in their room.<br /><br />I was absolutely chilled when I read that story!<br /><br /> It was VERY C-R-E-E-P-Y!<br /><br />  I have been to several of the hotels listed in this book.<br /><br />One of the ones I've been to is the Eldridge Hotel in Lawrence, KS.<br /><br />They actually have a photo there that they keep behind the front desk that someone took of a ghost in the elevator.<br /><br />I've seen that picture- It's VERY EERIE.  (I wasn't fortunate enough, though, to catch a glimpse of a ghost there with my own eyes!)<br /><br />~~~~~The author includes a haunted site for each of the 50 states. Mitchel Whitington is totally believable and 100% credible. All of these stories are true.<br /><br />He is a great writer!<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!100% credible.

This book is among my very large collection of ghost books. It is way up there as one of my favorites.<br /><br />I think that this is a very intriguing book.<br /><br />Nancy Roberts has written MANY books on ghosts and hauntings- and all of her books seem to be very well researched.<br /><br />In this book- some of the haunted places mentioned are:<br /><br />The Lizzie Borden House (Fall River, Massachusetts)<br /><br />Del Coronado Hotel (Coronado, CA)<br /><br />Whaley House (Museum)- San Diego<br /><br />The Winchester Mansion- San Jose, CA<br /><br />The Governor's Haunted Mansion- Woodburn, Dover, Delaware)<br /><br />Ashton Villa (Galveston, TX)<br /><br />The Pirate's House (Savannah, Georgia)- now a restaurant<br /><br />Lucas Tavern- (Montgomery, Alabama)<br /><br />Loudoun House- (Philadelphia)<br /><br />Carnton Plantation- (Franklin, TN)<br /><br />The Gaffos House- (Portsmouth, VA)<br /><br />The Myrtles- (St. Francisville, LA)<br /><br />Hotel Ione- (Ione, CA)<br /><br />The Alexander-Phillips House)- Springfield, Massachusetts)<br /><br />Inn By The Sea- (Cape Elizabeth, Maine)<br /><br />There are many more haunted places not listed here that are in the book.<br /><br />Each haunted location comes with a great black and white photograph - which is GREAT. I want to know what each haunted location looks like. This book has that great quality (which unfortunately many ghost books lack).<br /><br />Also, all of the haunted locations in this book are documented and well-known haunted places.<br /><br />FIVE STARS!<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!<br /><br />(...)	2005-08-04

Rock Creek, Last Chance Creek, Gunsight Pass, Indian Trails, The Crossing of the Fathers, Navajo Creek, Wright Bar (a wall filled with TONS of ancient old petroglyphs), Galloway Cave, Sentinel Rock, Wahweap Canyon, Tapestry Wall, Moqui Canyon, The Stanton Gold Dredge, Hall's Crossing, and much, much more!!<br />66 sites are talked about in great depth and detail.

It is very extensive. There are 3 volumes in this series- this one (which is Volume 2), plus Volume 1 (Northern region) and Volume 3 (Southern region...<br />What is nice is that these books are pretty updated (1999). Some of the Colorado ghost town books that I have looked at are very outdated- published around the 1970's.<br />This book (as well as the other 2 in the series) are very thick books-this one has 616 pages!)<br />It is packed full of infomation.<br />Some ghost town books leave some of the smaller, lesser-known ghost towns out- but these 3 volumes have them all!<br />There are black and white photos for each ghost town- plus the fascinating history behind each one. Some even have updated information listed about the town- such as how the Ghost town of Guffey (originally called Freshwater)once had a dog as Mayor-and they now have a cat as Mayor!! (This is true).<br />In this book- Volume 2- Central Region- it includes these counties:<br />Eagle, Garfield, Pitkin, Park, Lake, Teller, Chaffee and Gunnison.<br />The ghost towns listed are NUMEROUS- but here are just some of them:<br />Redstone, Ruby, Ashcroft, Aspen (once called \\"Ute City\\"), Carbondale, Emma, Dotsero, Independence, Gilman, Gold Park, Cripple Creek, Altman, Anaconda and Mound City, Tabor City, Dayton, Guffey, Fairplay, Buckskin Joe, Como,<br />White Pine, Tincup, Sargents, Quartz, Pitkin, Ohio City, Pieplant,Marble, Irwin, Iola, Gothic.

Reilly- or Dearborn Real Estate- felt it necessary to include Spanish words next to many of the real estate terms.<br />I want to learn real estate- in English- not in Spanish.<br />And I felt that to be a huge distraction.<br />I want to learn real estate terms in ENGLISH- not in Spanish.<br />I was very disappointed when I saw that.<br />Maybe the author should publish an English version- and a Spanish version.<br /><br />I took Spanish in college- and I want to learn REAL ESTATE- not a foreign language.<br />It is an excellent book - and in my opinion that is it's only flaw.	2003-05-22

I cannot speak highly enough of this book.<br />My boyfriend and I just got back from our first trip to Yellowstone- and this book was invaluable to us.<br />We took it with us as we went to the various geyser basins. It was incredibly helpful!<br />We read about the geysers,hot springs, fumuroles and mud pots as we got to each one.<br />The book also has great color photos of each feature.<br />It is broken down into these sections:<br />* Geyser Life<br />* Mammoth Hot Spring Terraces<br />* Norris Geyser Basin<br />* Gibbon Geyser Basin<br />* Lower Geyser Basin<br />* Midway Geyser Basin<br />* Biscuit Geyser Basin<br />* Black Sand Basin<br />* Upper Geyser Basin<br />* Shoshone Geyser Basin<br />* Mud Volcano Area<br />* West Thumb Geyser Basin<br />* Heart Lake Geyser Basin<br />* New Zealand - (3 hot springs)<br />As an example, here's what the book says about Fountain Paint Pots (in the Lower Geyser Basin):<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------<br />Temperature= 202.8 degrees F<br />Dimensions: 80 X 40 feet<br />  Fountain Paint Pots was originally named \\"Mud Puff\\" by the 1871 Hayden survey and later turn-of-the-century tourists called it Mammoth Paint Pots.But guide books referred to the area as Fountain Geyser and Paintpots and the name was adopted in 1927.<br />The mud is composed of clay and fine particles of silica broken down by acids and grinding action.<br />The tinting of the mud in colors of pink and gray from iron oxides is derived from the original rock.<br />The bubbling action results in escaping steam and gasses- mainly carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide.<br />In the spring and early summer the mud is thin and the pots boil. By late summer and fall there is less moisture and the mud is thicker, creating unusual shapes and formations.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------<br />The only gripe that I have about this book is that it does not list every single feature.<br />There is a map at the beginning of each section- in red are the features that are talked about- and in black are the ones that are not mentioned.<br /> In the Lower Geyser Basin- there were several feautures that we came to that were not talked about in the book, such as:<br />Leather Pool, Celestine Pool, Firehole Pool and Surprise Pool, Hot Lake, Jet Geyser, Twig Geyser, etc...<br />In the Midway Geyser Basin, Opal Pool is not talked about. We walked up to it and wanted to know more about it.<br />But I do highly recommend this book.<br />Most of the features are listed. The author talks about the history and goes into detail about the characteristics about the features.<br />I recommend this book for anyone taking their first trip to Yellowstone. Take this book along with you as you tour the fascinating geological features of the park.You will be glad that you had this helpful guide.<br />This book also is great for everyone who loves Yellowstone and would like to learn more about the magic of this park.a map at the beginning of each section- in red are the features that are talked about- and in black are the ones that are not mentioned.<br /> In the Lower Geyser Basin- there were several feautures that we came to that were not talked about in the book, such as:<br />Leather Pool, Celestine Pool, Firehole Pool and Surprise Pool, Hot Lake, Jet Geyser, Twig Geyser, etc...<br />In the Midway Geyser Basin, Opal Pool is not talked about.

I was thinking about getting another book on the history of New Mexico but I wasn't quite sure about it. The sales clerk at a bookstore in Sante Fe recommended that I get this one.I didn't even see it until she pointed it out to me. Boy, am I glad she did!<br /> Once I started looking at it at the bookstore I found it so interesting that I could literally not stop reading it.I guess that was a good sign that I should buy it.<br />  My boyfriend and I have never been to New Mexico- and as we  drove through little towns along the way I opened up the book and read about the history behind each town. It was very informative and helpful.<br />It has great black and white photos and neat drawings that depict the historical events in a fascinating fashion.<br />  Every town is mentioned- even tiny ones that no one has ever heard of such as: Wagon Mound, Maxwell, Embudo, Watrous, Valmora, Tatum, Dora, Lingo, White Rock, etc....<br />  It mentions Los Alomos and the Manhattan Project, Taos, Albuquerque, etc...<br />This book gives a history of each town, how and when it was founded, by whom, and in some cases how the town got its name.<br />I highly recommend this book.

My 5 year-old niece, Elizabeth, just lost her very first tooth, so I decided to get her this book and velvet pouch.I found out about it from Amazon.com.<br />  Her Grandma was baby-sitting her at the time, and as soon as she received it she wanted Grandma to read the whole book to her immediately.<br />  Then when my sister and brother-in-law got home, my niece had my sister read her the WHOLE book AGAIN!<br />She absolutely LOVES the book and velvet pouch.<br />It was so special to her when she lost her first tooth. She has another tooth that is quite wobbly (which she'll probably lose any day now) so the velvet pouch will come in very handy.<br />She did ask my sister, however, if the Tooth Fairy got to keep the velvet pouch.She was VERY concerned about the velvet pouch, and if it was hers to keep or the Tooth Fairy's. My sister assured her that it was her very own velvet pouch to keep.<br />  I highly recommend this precious little book and velvet pouch as a gift for a child who has lost their first tooth/ or is about to lose a tooth.It is a very sweet and adorable gift for a very special and memorable event.	2002-01-17

In the back of the book are various weather-related websites.<br />  I am originally from Kansas, which is part of &quot;Tornado Alley&quot; - and I amazed that Colorado also has tornadoes--which I never knew- (although they are more likely to occur on the far eastern plains).<br /> I had no idea that the eastern plains of Colorado are also one of the hail capitols of the world.<br />This book is truly captivating for anyone who is fascinated by weather. I highly recommend it.	2001-11-13

I took it along with me when I visited the Grand Canyon (North Rim), and Zion. I refer to it before I go to any national park, and I find it extremely helpful and loaded with excellent information.<br />I am reading up on Mount Rainier before we visit there next month.<br />This guide has beautiful color and glossy photos. It also mentions National Recreation Areas; such as Lake Mead and Lake Powell (Glen Canyon NRA).<br />One thing I felt it should have mentioned is the incredibly stunning POINT SUBLIME viewing point area in the Grand Canyon. (North Rim). This I found out about in another National Park book, as well as from a park ranger. Sublime is an extremly remote and &quot;off-the-beaten path&quot; viewing area. The views from this point are absolutely spectacular. It is very remote, and you have to take a 2 hour 4-wheeing trip through the forests and rocky, rough roads to get there; but it is well worth it. We found it to be the best view by far of the Canyon and Colorado River. Very breathtaking indeed.<br />All in all, this is one of the best National Park books I have found by far. I highly recommend it.	2001-09-01
