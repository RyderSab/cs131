Ms. Tyler takes each book in turn, gives a synopsis of the plot and places it in historical context and in the context of Austen's life. She then explains those details that might be abstract to those not familiar with Regency culture, such as entailed property, the importance of walking and the attitude toward marriage, making the reader comfortable with the novel. She includes illustrations, interviews, quizzes and delightful bits on the side such as \\"10 Surefire Ways to be Vulgar\\", a table of average income and \\"Sense and Sensibility: A Checklist\\". In addition, she finishes the book lists of movie versions, book spin-offs and sequels and shows Austen's role (her \\"legacy\\") in our century.<br /><br />An Austen fan from way back, I found this a truly delightful book. Ms. Tyler is humorous as well as informative and her enthusiasm for Austen is apparent. This is a must-have for Austen fans, no question about it; the resources provided in The Friendly Jane Austen further the enjoyment of reading Austen's novels. It is also an excellent book for those that have just started reading Austen. With this book by your side, you can't fail to see just how wonderful Jane Austen was, and still is.	2005-10-03

Sunset Jones kills her abusive husband and becomes constable of the logging camp in his stead.  When a dead baby is discovered, she begins an investigation that uncovers greed and villainy in the political structure and put her, and all she cares about, in grave danger.<br /><br />The book jacket calls it a \\"wildly energetic novel--galvanizing from first to last\\".  What the publishers call \\"energetic\\", I call overly fast paced to the point motion sickness; furthermore, I was galvanized to nothing except annoyance.  Landsdale's descriptive style is generally crass and rude.  Why use just a word when a cuss word or vulgar word can be put in.  For example, a dying man thinks, \\"Goddamn, taken from behind, that's not right, not me, I'm always ready, but goddamn, I feel it, a knife in my back, tight as a bull's dick in a chicken's ass\\".  Such needless vulgarity cheapened the scene, which should have been moving, as well as making it unrealistic.  The overusage of \\"pussy\\", \\"bitch\\" and \\"dick\\" and over-focus on sex and attractive women made this appear to the be the work of a hormonal teenager.<br /><br />Also unrealistic were some of the personal interactions.  They seem stilted and fake, and in the case of Sunset and Lee, simply wrong.  I found it extremely difficulty to believe that she could accept and trust him that quickly.  With other relationships, the dynamics (Two and McBride for instance, or Hillbilly's ability to snow everyone he met) did not have the ring of truth.<br /><br />In addition, Landsdale's use of run-ons, lack of conjunctures and overall poor writing skills were simply tiresome.  This is the writer that has won six Bram Stoker Awards as well as three other awards?  Perhaps I've caught him on a bad day.  All I can say is that his style is not to my taste and the only thing that kept me reading was curiosity about the murder.  I shouldn't have wasted my time, as the outcome followed true to the rest of the book and was a great disappointment.e, as the outcome followed true to the rest of the book and was a great disappointment.	2005-09-11
US	36628753	RYCW8JUORFOLW	0316778508	744408823	The Dogs of Babel: A Novel	Books	4	4	6	N	N	Mostly Good	When Paul Iverson's wife, Lexy, falls from an apple tree, her instantaneous death is ruled an accident, but Paul is not certain. Certain things done by Lexy that day lead him to think that it could have been intentional. The only witness to the fall was Lexy's dog, Lorelei, and Paul becomes obsessed with the desire to know what Lorelei knows. He leaves his job as a linguistics professor and tries to teach Lorelei to speak.<br /><br />The story is told in both the present and the past, using effective flashbacks and memories, as Paul narrates the story of their relationship, what he knows of Lexy's past and his attempts with Lorelei. Some of their early relationship is quite beautiful, with Paul's offering of \\"square eggs\\" being quite original and sentimental and is my favorite scene from the book.<br /><br />Paul is a generally likable character, his deep grief seeming natural and real and his dependence on Lorelei in the days after Lexy's death both sweet and sad. The object of his mourning, on the other hand, was not nearly so appealing.<br /><br />We only see Lexy through Paul's besotted eyes, but her whimsical nature and fragile emotions did not inspire the same admiration in me. In particular, Lexy's emotional difficulties came across as teenage angst that had not yet matured into a woman's turmoil. As such, she elicited more annoyance than sympathy, which worked against the beauty of Paul's grief. As is the trend of late for current novels, The Dogs of Babel seems a bit pretentious with it's excess of darkness and seems to draw attention to its dark aspect with Lexy's outbursts. Instead of giving The Dogs of Babel a tense, emotional feel, this aspect gave it a forced feeling, as if Ms. Parkhurst were trying too hard.<br /><br />Paul's attempts to teach Lorelei to speak lead to the most unappealing part of the book; he has some interaction with a group of weirdoes (no other word will do) who are attempting to give dogs speech by cruel surgical ways. At one point, I put the book down, determined to read no further until I knew for certain that Lorelei would not be hurt. The animal cruelty element seemed to be unnecessary as well as a turn off for<br /><br />myself (and I'm sure many other readers).<br /><br />Despite my dissatisfaction with some aspects, I found The Dogs of Babel to be an engrossing first novel. Ms. Parkhurst has an easy style, and is very adept at weaving the back story into the present action. Her short chapters speed the reader from one to the next, with a genuine build up of suspense evident. I cared about Paul and Lorelei and was anxious for the situation to resolve. Though the ending was much weaker than the rest of the book, overall it was a satisfying reading experience. I will be interested to read Ms. Parkhurst's future works, unless of course, she continues to use the theme of animal cruelty, and expect to continue to hear good things about her as a writer.one point, I put the book down, determined to read no further until I knew for certain that Lorelei would not be hurt.

She had been an orphan for several years, living with an older aunt and her beloved baby brother, but they had recently succumbed to a fever and died.  Hattie feels guilty that she survived; not only survived but is now living in luxurious circumstances with her uncle, his wife and daughter, Sophie.<br /><br />We follow Hattie as she begins to accept her new life, becomes friends with her cousin and starts boarding school.  As Sophie's cousin, she becomes part of her little group, now nicknamed The Quartette.<br /><br />Her close friendship with The Quartette and her habit of follow Sophie's lead becomes jeopardized by the arrival of a new student, Fannie Macintosh, a wild young women from the West with no sense of propriety.  In spite of Sophie's disapproval, Hattie becomes drawn to Fannie.  Sophie makes it clear that Hattie has to choose and, sadly, Hattie chooses The Quartette.<br /><br />What follows is Hattie's search for herself, a self that SHE makes, not a Hattie created by Sophie or others.  Even as she changes and seeks to rectify mistakes, Hattie finds that the things we do affect others and not always be fixed.<br /><br />Ms. Warner states that it is based on her great-grandmother's journal but there is disappointingly little of the journal in it, and by the author's own admission there is more fiction than non-fiction.<br /><br />Finding Hattie is an historical novel most suited for early teens.  It is written at a level that should be an easy and enjoyable read for that age group.  It is intended to give a fairly good life lesson about the importance of being oneself and being true to ones self, though I was not fully satisfied.  However, I am reading it as an adult and though it seemed lukewarm in it's message to me, the other reviews I have seen indicate that the proper aged reader finds it much more enlightening.	2005-08-29

Magic historians still flourish, but practicing magicians had not been seen for hundreds of years until Mr. Norrell demonstrates his ability.<br /><br />Mr. Norrell feels his job is to bring practical magic back to England, but only by himself-he has sought out and crushed the attempts of any other magician in England.  Things continue on in this way, with Mr. Norrell as London's favorite novelty and the Government's chief war weapon, until Jonathan Strange arrives on the scene showing that he, too, can practice magic.  To everyone's surprise, Mr. Norrell takes him as his pupil.<br /><br />The rest of the novel is too complex to explain, but involves fairies, war, rivalries, madness and, of course, magic, as Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell unknowingly fulfill a prophecy and bring practical magic back to England.<br /><br />The best part about this book is the mythology that Ms. Clarke has created.  There are footnotes that relate to books and magicians and history that make up this alternate universe.  This was an excellent addition and I applaud Ms. Clarke for this background work.<br /><br />The style of the novel, however, is it's downfall.  Ms. Clarke has written it in the language and style of a 19th century novel, which (while delightful to one like me who enjoys Austen and Radcliff and the like) can make it very hard going.  I actually started reading it two times before I succeeding in getting past the first few chapters.  As it is such a slow read, I was apt to set it down and forget about it for days.<br /><br />While actually reading it, though, I was fascinated.  The story is very deep and intricate; it is obvious that Ms. Clarke has put tremendous effort in its crafting.  Despite my enjoyment of it, though, my dissatisfaction with the ending and it's general slowness makes me rate it lower than it probably deserves.  I certainly can not give it a universal referral and am surprised that so many people have managed to read and review it.al slowness makes me rate it lower than it probably deserves.

In fact, it's hardly a biography at all.  There is a basic, short and to-the-point Lennon life story, but with nothing new or surprising.<br /><br />What Lennon Legend is, though, is a multi-media celebration.  It comes with a CD of Lennon interviews, many of which were quite funny, with Lennon's personality seeping out of every one.  Every page of the book is filled with photos, and though the majority of them are well known, it's still a great selection.  But, the best part of the Lennon Legend is the removable Lennon memorabilia.  On nearly every other page are reproductions of pieces of memorabilia from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (the author, James Henke is curently the curator of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame).  Childhood drawings, a report card, handwritten lyrics, Beatles paraphernalia, Bag One drawings, and more.  This addition turned a coffee table book into a treasure.  It is a bit pricey, but I felt it was fully worth it.	2005-08-29

Bach and Frederick the Great-two prominent, and very different, historical figures. Gaines begins his tale with their first and only meeting. Frederick, the Enlightenment's poster child, scorns Bach and his music as old fashioned, unsightly and-worst of all- religious. He presents Bach with two musical challenges, which Bach responds to in his typical fashion.<br /><br />After this initial introduction, Gaines begins the biographies of these two great men, recording their extreme dissimilarities and showing how these would culminate into Fredrick's difficult test, and Bach's equally difficult rejoinder. Into their stories, Gaines weaves many different threads-musical history, musical theory, theology, religious history, philosophy and the basic history of their time and place-to create a complex background on which to place the two, making for a detailed and fascinating story.<br /><br />There were few \\"dull\\" places, though I did find some of the music theory hard-going, due to my lack of pre-knowledge. However, I came away from reading Evening in the Palace of Reason with a firmer grasp of not only Bach and Frederick, but counterpoint, Lutheranism, the 18th century, Prussian history and many more things I knew nothing about before I picked up the book!Though this is a scholarly work, Gaines did not target a purely scholarly audience, and as a result it can be enjoyed by layperson or historian alike.<br /><br />I did find a few faults with this work, the most aggrieving being the lack of dates. Though I am a history enthusiast myself, I still need solid, concrete dates to place an incident within the framework of what was occurring in other parts of the world. Despite knowing when the Enlightenment \\"occurred\\", I would have preferred dates on the essential issues, such as the year of their births, the year in which they met, the year in which anything occurred. I found this lack of dates to be a continual frustration.<br /><br />Otherwise, except for a few passages that were simply not well written, Gaines has done an admirable job with Evening in the Palace of Reason. This is a great read for amateur social or music historians, or biography aficionados.

One night, she gets mugged-or at least that's what it seems like is happening-but the mugger does something totally odd.  He bites  her neck, shoves thousands of dollars into her shirt and pulls a dumpster over her.  When she awakens, she makes the unsettling discovery that she has become a bloodsucking fiend.<br /><br />Being a vampire isn't all glamour and bloodsucking, of course; there's a disappointing practical side to it as well.  When you'll fry in the sunlight, how in the world can you get simple things done, like rent a new apartment, get your car out of the impound and quit your job.  Jodi finds the perfect accomplice in Tommy, who is fresh from Indiana, quite young,  and full of big ideas of how to make it in San Francisco.  Tommy and Jodi naturally fall in love and settle into a settled pattern of vampire and minion.<br /><br />The story doesn't end there, though.  Oh no; I mean how could it-this is a Christopher Moore novel, after all!  Several murders, another evil vampire, Tommy's co-workers, a couple of snapping turtles, the use of a deep freezer, along with the Emperor of the United States and Protector of Mexico, play crucial parts as Tommy and Jodi find that, yes, life CAN get even more difficult, yes things CAN  get worse.  As usual, Moore takes all the bizarre loose ends, ties them up in a breathtaking package and presents the reader with another amazing novel.  Both my husband and I resent the years it took us to find Moore and eagerly await another novel, while highly recommending Bloodsucking Fiends.  And don't let the fact that I gave it only four stars turn you off. . .

Otherwise, things go much the same at Hogwarts as always. . . new teachers, misunderstandings between friends, homework, crushes, Quidditch, and deadly peril.<br /><br />Rowling's latest is another exceptionally good work from the first page to the last. I'll not give any spoilers, but will only say that the final chapters were so intense and emotional that I've thought of little else since I finished reading it two days ago! Much of it is open to debate, hopeful re-interpretation and speculation-and I expect we'll see a lot of it as we wait for the final installment. Rowling will have a lot to answer in the book seven, as the Half Blood Prince asked more questions than it answered and ended with many loose ends to be tied. In the meantime, this book 1s well worth at least one more read for it's funny lines, awesome adventure and exceptional writing. My admiration for its author deepens, as does my love and concern for its characters.	2005-07-19

On their disappearance, however, his older brother, Sylvanus, stole the throne and Quicksilver became immersed in bitterness and hatred. He would do anything to regain his rightful place, regardless of the hurt he might cause to others.<br /><br />Sylvanus, fancier of mortal women, has just lost his wife to childbirth. He takes a solid, and to him immeasurably attractive, country woman, nursing her own child, to be nursemaid to his motherless child-with the intent of making her much more than just a nursemaid.<br /><br />Will Shakespeare comes come from work one evening to find his wife and infant daughter missing, replaced by sticks of wood. Sick with worry, he sets out on the long walk to Nan's family, in hopes she has been called there to attend a pregnant relative. While passing through Arden Forrest he sees the most bizarre vision: his wife, Nan, dressed in courtly clothing dancing with royalty in a castle set in air that Will cannot penetrate. Quicksilver involves Will in his plot for the throne, throwing the four of them-five if you count Quicksilver's spurned lover-into a plot worthy of the bard himself.<br /><br />Sarah Hoyt's interpretation of Will Shakespeare's past is novel and enjoyable, with both humor and seriousness. As Shakespeare often did , Hoyt gives the comedy some tragic turns-some, however, that I felt weren't well enough resolved. I would be interested to hear what other readers have to say as well. She gives another nod to Shakespeare by throwing in quotes, tongue in cheek, in a mostly amusing way. Some seemed to forced, but they often brought a grin.<br /><br />I enjoyed seeing the young, tentative Will who was very much in love with his older wife Nan. He proves himself to be very much the nineteen-year-old boy, who loves both with his heart and with his-well, his other parts. He was no match for the wiles of Quicksilver or for the beautiful mysterious woman. It is said that mortals who have been loved by an elf go crazy-Hoyt points out Kit Marlow and then shows Will following that same path, a nice wink toward his greatness and it's source.<br /><br />I also enjoyed seeing Anne Hathaway Shakespeare in another role than that of shrew, as so many portray her. In Ill Met By Moonlight, Nan has a strong (though not shrewish) character, both standing up to Sylvanus and looking out for Will's best interest; it is she that I was the most fond of by the end of the book.<br /><br />Overall, this was a fresh take on an old subject and I found it, if not engrossing, generally delightful.

I read it in two sittings; simply couldn't put it down.<br /><br /> Was some of it too far fetched?  Sure, but who cares; it was a fun read!  Dean Koontz somehow tricks the reader into believing the most bizarre things that don't cause the raised eyebrows until a few days after reading.  That's just one of his trademarks.  He manages to make the books fun enough (in a scary and exciting way) that a stretch in reality doesn't matter.<br /><br />My only two problems about Velocity were the amazing ease of finding body disposal sites and my uncertain reaction to the identity of the \\"freak\\".  I'd like to chat with other readers and see if they felt the same way I did on the second point.<br /><br />Other than these minor points, Velocity was a thoroughly enjoyable book, both easy to read and highly engrossing.

Everything about Chinpan is different from what Apropos is accustomed to, from their looks to their odd over-developed sense of honor. He stumbles upon a small farming village, made up mainly of the Chin family, and to his surprise, makes himself at home with them as a simple farmer. He is encouraged to study with the village's revered teacher, Chinpan Ali, who begins to teach Po how to empty himself and find peace. Apropos finds himself in the unusual position of being happy-and he waits for the axe to drop. Which, naturally, it does.<br /><br />Chinpan Ali is murdered and Po seeks vengeance-biting off way more than he can chew. Again, what's new?! He angers the Hamunri Clan, the criminal organization the Forked Tong, the Tong's Skang Ke family, the Anais Ninjas, and pretty much everyone else he encounters. The Imperior, the head of the Skang Ke family (Skang Kei Ho), an annoying person named Mitsu, and a former acquaintance also make Po's revenge-and life-more difficult and he goes from one bizarre situation to the next.<br /><br />Like the first two Apropos books, Tong Lashing is filled with that bizarre humor that makes a Peter David book so darn good. Puns, the outrageous, satire, sarcasm and the just plain funny run rampant, making the reader groan and laugh at the same time.<br /><br />Unlike the others, Tong Lashing is rather introspective. (Consider the dedication: \\"to all those who had the chance and passed\\".) Po begins to change, sometimes subtly, sometimes obviously, and to rethink his prior way of living. Whereas it used to be every man for himself and Po first, others start taking a more important role in his life.<br /><br />While still enjoyable, and still a four-star book, I want to warn the reader that it IS different from the previous books. Not different in a bad way, but definitely different. There is a more serious tone to this book, with humor taking a back seat to Po's development, with an ending that leaves one confused and thinking, just like Po. If you've read the first two, you need to read this third-and possibly final-volume of Apropos' life.more serious tone to this book, with humor taking a back seat to Po's development, with an ending that leaves one confused and thinking, just like Po.

Darwin's brother, Erasmus, has been kidnapped by the \\"blackhearted Bishop of Oxford\\" to keep Darwin from exhibiting Mister Bobo, who he (Darwin) has trained to communicate with word cards. The Pirate Captain and his crew return to London to assist Darwin in rescuing Erasmus, a feat which forces all the pirates to pretend to be scientists, and some of them to pretend to be scientists pretending to be women.<br /><br />What do you mean it doesn't make any sense? It's not supposed to! That's the beauty of this little gem: with one outrageous chapter after another, The Pirates! is full of puns, jokes and allusions. It's purposefully written with no sense of historical accuracy, adding an extra layer of fun, and uses every piratical clich&eacute; and stereotype to the fullest humorous advantage. Scurvy, a hot air balloon, ham, a grisly murder machine, swashbuckling, an exciting chase scene in the Museum of Natural History, talking primates, breakfast cereal and pirates! What's not to love?<br /><br />The Pirates! is Defoe's first novel and, for me, is the best comic novel debut I have ever had to fortune to read. Not only was it hard to put down, but it demanded to be read aloud, first by me to my husband, and then by him back to me as he read it! The book cover says that he \\"wrote the Pirates! to convince a woman to leave her boyfriend for him. She didn't\\".

But like him I do.  Lindsay has created a complex character and a book that deserves a full five stars.  Even if I feel a wee bit guilty for recommended it!	2005-01-04

The harrowing adventures of my favorite anti-hero, Sir Apropos of Nothing, continue! The Woad to Wuin starts shortly after the first novel leaves off, with Apropos hiding in the forest (if you don't know why, read the first one!) scavenging for food. He traps a dwarf, accidentally, and picks up a very special ring. Several pages of Lord of the Rings spoofy-goofiness follows. And that's just the beginning.<br /><br />Let's see. . . he becomes an inn keeper, gets lost in some dark tunnels, becomes the powerful Peacelord, ruler of Wuin and conqueror of countries, has an amazingly beautiful wife-What? Peacelord? Conqueror? Wife? Is this the same Apropos? Our cowardly safety-conscious non-warrior has become blood thirsty, battle mad, conquering terror? Yep.<br /><br />Problem is, he's not sure how it happened. He wakes up on the battlefield and-well, apparently he's sleep-walked through a year or so and keeping up the appearance is NOT going to be easy. One misstep away from being headless, Apropos tries to continue his heroics-at least until he can slip away-but he keeps having troubles, what with enemies and odd pets and loyal but bloodthirsty armies and marital duties and old flames and rebellious peoples and . . . Being a Peacelord is no easy chore! Especially for a cynic who knows that life is just out to get him.<br /><br />If you liked the first Apropos, and delight in puns and spoofs and general hilarity, you'll enjoy the Woad to Wuin. I can't say that it was as good as the first, but it still deserves a hearty four stars and I'm anxiously looking forward to the next one.	2004-12-12

Many years before, Jean's father was executed for the murder of her mother. Jean just wants to know the truth. As Jimmy sets out to find the answers for Jean, he stirs up unexpected trouble from L.

Jimmy's investigation causes him to step on the toes of some of the more powerful Sailors.<br /><br />The premise was exciting, but The Quick doesn't deliver. The cloud of secrecy and intrigue that surrounds the Sailors builds and builds. . . but the apex is a disappointing and somewhat silly ritual.<br /><br />The actual mystery Jimmy is out to solve, never comes to a satisfying conclusion.

The birth of her son Shibli, and her desertion by Shibli's father, marks a turning point in her life and leads her to give more serious thought to her spiritual life, the result of which is her desire to participate in the hajj, the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca.<br /><br />Standing Alone in Mecca is the very personal memoir of Nomani's experiences during the hajj, of her struggles as a woman in what has become a male dominant religion, of her search for a God of love among all the dogma, and finally of how the journey helped her redefine her spiritual life. She examines her life prior to the hajj, tries to work out the knotty problems of issues like pre-marital sex and divine forgiveness and the horror that some have done in the name of her faith. Nomani bares her heart and her soul to the reader as she seeks her truth.<br /><br />This books is more than just a spiritual journal, though. It also gives outsiders a closer, clearer few of Islam, it's practices and it's history. I found it to be not only enlightening, but very timely for our age.<br /><br />Ms. Nomani has opened a new world for me by helping me be rid of many stereotypes and prejudices that I had unwittingly harbored. I hope that others will read it and find the same release from ignorance and a renewal of love and respect for others.	2004-12-11

Imagine her shock, as he grabbed her ankles and heaved her over--and as she woke up alive, on a small island, rescued by a floating bale of pot and a former police detective named Mick. Joey wants to Chaz to pay, and how! Instead of contacting the police, though, Joey plans to get revenge her own way. She and Mick come up with a plan to make Chaz's live thoroughly miserable and haunted up to the point where he'll find confessing to the police a pleasure.<br /><br />Chaz, on the other hand, thinks he has committed the perfect crime. He doesn't anticipate a suspicious investigator sniffing around, or that his mistress would start causing problems, or that his boss would assign him a babysitter. . . and never in his wildest dreams did he think he'd be blackmailed!<br /><br />Carl Hiaasen's Skinny Dip is a hip, funny novel of betrayal and revenge with lots of clever lines, a strong plot and several surprises. The secondary characters were just as detailed and real as the primary ones were, and I became quite attached to a couple of them. Little side details --Detective Rolvaag's snakes for instance, or Chaz's swamp adventures, or Tool`s nursing home adventures--were given just as much importance and gave the novel a great feel. I enjoyed it clear to the odd ending and give it a full five stars.<br /><br />Novel contains adult language and situations.	2004-11-18

No, in this gentle mystery, Albert mixes fact with fiction and in telling of Miss Potter's first visit to Hill Top Farm as owner. There is no gruesome murder, no horrid secrets, no fearsome villain. Instead, there are a few missing items in the village of Near Sawrey that bring a ripple of disturbance to their (mostly) peaceful village. Miss Potter is not the detective, she doesn't seek out to find the missing items, nor does she use any deductive skills to solve the mysteries. She is merely the central point around which the story moves.<br /><br />The thing that turns this from just the average village story, sprinkled with domestic mystery, to a delightful and charming story is the animals. Miss Potter brings here hedgehog, two bunnies and mouse with her. Also, the village has quite a cast of cats and dogs. What's even better-they talk! Not to humans, of course, but to each other. There conversations are recorded in italics, so the reader knows immediately which species is communicating. Albert uses it to make several amusing scenes where the animals are trying to tell the humans something, only to be told to stop meowing, or that there's no more fish, or that if they stop that noise they'll have to go outside. How shocked the village residents would be to discover that their pets made great detectives!<br /><br />Another feature that makes this book so interesting is Miss Potter herself. Albert gives the reader glimpses of Miss Potters biography that made me sincerely want to read more. Luckily, Albert included a biographical not at the end, following Potter's life up to the point when the Hill Top Farm visit took place. I was interested enough, though, to want to know of Miss Potter, of what happens next, of when she does finally move in to Hill Top Farm. I was inspired to re-read Miss Potter's tales, as well, from the many mentions made of them.<br /><br />I've used the word already, but \\"gentle\\" seems the best way to describe The Tale of Hill Top Farm. Pastoral, perhaps would also give the right impression; it is an escape from telephones and traffic and tv (and murder mysteries) to a slower time, when the loss of the Parish Register is a dreadful thing. Animal lovers will enjoy this book, though it might not be quite as satisfying to mystery lovers. Personally, I'm looking forward to the next of \\"The Cottage Tales of Beatrix Potter\\".as well, from the many mentions made of them. <br /> <br />I've used the word already, but \\"gentle\\" seems the best way to describe The Tale of Hill Top Farm.

She was Andrew's court appointed psychologist, and it is suspected (though not proven) that they were having an affair. Gow, a convicted serial killer and rapist, was released on appeal and murdered shortly thereafter, apparently by Susie in a jealous rage<br /><br />Susie's husband Lachlan is certain that she would not and did not do such a thing. He is searching through her study for anything that might could be used during an appeal. The novel is the journal he kept of his findings, his interpretation of what he finds, and his emotions, fears, doubts as he uncovers layer upon layer of Susie's deception.<br /><br />All that is given is Lachie's view; we see the world only through his eyes. We are surprised, shocked, and deceived along with him-and possibly, just possibly, surprised, shocked, and deceived by him. When the conclusion arrives, it is not a package of neatly tied-up ends. It is another question, leaving the reader wondering what really IS the truth?<br /><br />Deception is masterfully written. Any flaws that I might have noticed reading were so minor that I'd forgotten them by the end of the book. There is no question that it a full five star book, and it comes highly recommended to those looking for an atypical suspense/mystery.	2004-11-14

He is still in his teens when his mother is murdered by a customer and he sets out to bring her killer to justice. Being a coward-or, as Apropos might have phrased it, being quick to save himself if danger is imminent-he has no desire to inflict the justice himself; that's a job for the King.<br /><br />Petitioning the King sets off a chain of events that leaves him as the squire to an aged, derelict, nearly amnesiac knight by the name of Sir Umbrage of the Flaming Nether Regions. And it just gets worse. Apropos is no hero, what's more he has no desire to be heroic, and yet he gets thrown into position after position that require him to do just that. He is nearly killed by the children of the harpies, he nearly gets trampled by unicorns, he smashes the skull of his best friend, he (just barely) rescues a pyromaniac princess, he kills a man who might be his father. . . After the adventures are all over and done with, Apropos is a knight (of nothing) and much the worse for wear. Which, of course, is when things get even worse!<br /><br />With Apropos, our anti-hero, it's one hilarious (mis)adventure after another, all provided at his expense, and I loved it! Peter David has written Apropos with his tongue firmly in cheek, throwing out puns, irreverence, spoofs and laughs, often when one least expects it. I laughed hard, read a LOT of it out loud and hated to see it end. Despite all the outrageousness, the fantasy is quite plausible; it's well-written, easy to read and hard to put down. Oddly enough, I cared about the scoundrel Apropos, and wondered with him if he really were a hero, or just a secondary character in someone else's story. Peter David has earned a place in my line of favorites, right up there with Douglas Adams and Jasper Fforde. This book rates a full five stars.tars.	2004-11-03

As the Drakhaoul of Azkendir, Gavril is also heir to strong powers and their potentially fatal consequence of wielding this power. He has to somehow balance the expectations of his new country, of his loved ones and of himself-a nearly impossible task-while also defending Azkendir from attack, and protecting himself from assignation.<br /><br />Ghosts, dragons and magicians mix with scientists, politicians and spies while werewolves and alchemists battle against clan warriors and revolutionaries. Gavril's odd world is half fairy tale, half nightmare, with betrayal, murder, true love, and blood sacrifice all woven together to form the thick plot.<br /><br />Unfortunately, despite many unique and creative ideas from Ms. Ash, there are also many stale fillers to be found in Lord of Snow and Shadows. I put the book down once, after reading a few pages; I have come across the \\"lowly boy meets noble lady and falls deeply in love\\" scenario (for example) more than thrice and didn't wish to read it again. Fortunately, I re-read the cover, and was intrigued anew by the tantalizing mention of dragons and Eastern myths. I re-started it only to hit the \\"poor boy suddenly discovers he is son of a king\\" bit. *sigh*<br /><br />I kept on, and after trudging through the first fifty or so pages, I was rewarded for my diligence with an intriguing read. That is not to say that there were not still several slow and uninteresting parts to follow. Furthermore, I felt that, rather than end the book at the end, she drew it out to provide enough to create a sequal.<br /><br />I did truly enjoy the supernatural and mythical elements-the dragons and werewolves in particular-but the human and political dramas were not as convincing. Ms. Ash's writing style was generally engrossing and comfortable to read, but I just felt that so much more could have been done with such an inspired theme; the concept was exciting and fresh, but the execution was sadly lacking. As a result, Lord of Snow and Shadow did not capture my imagination enough to make me eager for the sequel and I can therefore only rate it a three out of five.enerally engrossing and comfortable to read, but I just felt that so much more could have been done with such an inspired theme; the concept was exciting and fresh, but the execution was sadly lacking.

Berenbaum divides her book into four sections: how entomologists see insects, how the world sees insects, how entomologists see themselves and how an entomologist sees science. Topics include insect flatulence, the misrepresentation of insects in comic books, the stereotypical role of entomologists in movies, aged ants, the smoking of insects, naming insects and, as the name suggest, insect sex life. None of this, of course, would ever have been considered a humorous topic to me prior to this book. A few pages into it, however, and I was reading aloud the amazing, bizarre and comical facts about insects and entomologists. I must add, though, that the final section was not nearly as interesting and it took me a lot longer to read it than I did the others; the first two sections were especially droll and I flew through those hundred pages with amazing speed.<br /><br />Of course, this being a collection of humorous essays, each one had to end with a punch line, a pun or a joke. At times they seemed forced and this tended to lessen my enjoyment of the essay somewhat. Another detraction was the occasional incorrect punctuation. There was a tendency for quotation marks and parenthesis to start and never close, causing me to skim frantically down the page to see just when the thought would end. Despite these objections, Buzzwords was an pleasant-and eye-opening-read, fully deserving of four out of five stars.	2004-10-30

He found it inside a leather volume that he had won at dice; after a bit of research, he determines it to be an alchemist's letter, the recipe for gold. Nothing is ever as simple as it seems, though, and this letter had the uncanny ability to bring death to those who saw it and talked about it.<br /><br />Ned has just returned to London from exile and his former patron isn't as patronizing as Ned had anticipated, the love of his life has married one of his ill-wishers and his brother's business-and life-is in danger. Not exactly the homecoming he had expected.<br /><br />His interest about the Auriel letter goes no farther than curiosity, but as he soon discovers, there are others that find it of much more significance. Ned finds that he has endangered his friends and family and a whole host of innocent others as this search for Auriel's gold becomes the center of political intrigue.<br /><br />Having read Redfern's first novel (The Music of the Spheres), I was pleased to see the publication of her second novel. The plot of Auriel Rising is sound and thorough, bringing together many different points that seemed to have no possible connection. Ned Warriner is a likable protagonist, he and most of the other characters are convincing and on the whole the novel was fully credible. As an mix of alchemy and treason, it makes an intriguing read and I rate it a solid four out of five.	2004-10-24

Lynne Truss is a Punctuation Stickler, Her \\"zero tolerance approach\\" encourages other sticklers to go out into the punctuationaly-challenged world armed with White-out, sticky apostrophes, markers and the like to change signs and posters and get punctuation correct. She even advocates more drastic measures such as weapons and wishes for natural disasters: \\"If you still persist in writing, `Good food at it's best', you deserve to be struck by lightning, hacked up on the spot and buried in an unmarked grave.\\"<br /><br />Eats, Shoots and Leaves is not the typical punctuation instruction manual. It is a lively and spirited book filled with humorous, yet entirely appropriate, examples to make her point that good punctuation is extremely necessary; it's not just about sticking to the rules, it's about writing intelligibly. For instance, \\"a woman, without her man, is nothing\\" has a completely different meaning than when those same words are punctuated as \\"a woman: without her, man is nothing.\\" Wow, I said. She's right! Punctuation IS important.<br /><br />Truss gives easy to understand instructions as to where and when and how to use such wonderful marks as apostrophes, commas, dashes, colons, semicolons, exclamation marks, ellipses, parentheses, brackets, and more. In addition, she gives a brief and fascinating history of the amazingly recent creation and use of punctuation. I had no idea punctuation was so new!<br /><br />Truss also tickles the funny bone with example after example of punctuation misuse and abuse. Her chapter on the correct use of dashes and ellipses made me quite ashamed of my email habits, as I saw myself in many of her bad examples.<br /><br />Eats, Shoots and Leaves is a cheery, enjoyable read about a subject I never expected to find cheerful or enjoyable.

Though pregnant, she has run away from her well-respected (and abusive) husband, to live on her Grandfather’s farm in Minerva, Minnesota. Emotionally wounded, she cuts of her hair and refuses to wear women’s clothing, shedding all outward signs of her vulnerability. After her grandfather’s death, she takes over the farm, doing all the work herself, even though pregnant. The townspeople offer no help, even at harvest time, as she has alienated herself from them by what they perceive as her disgraceful and shocking behavior. (“It would be a lot easier to feel some sympathy is she let her hair grow back,” Mrs. Deal said, “and put on a dress.” p.11)<br /><br />Penelope (Penny) Niebeck is fifteen and longs to break away from an entirely different situation. Her beautiful mother, Barbara. is having an affair with their employer, the wealthy Mr. Hamilton. Penny is disgusted, horrified and guilt ridden with the knowledge. The fact that his wife is in a nursing home, dead to them mentally and dying physically, does not easy Penny’s shame, but rather intensifies it.<br /><br />After a violent altercation with Barbara over Mr. Hamilton, Penny leaves to answer Cora’s ad for a maid. Penny and Cora form a tight bond, Cora loosing her usual reticence with Penny and trying to encourage the girl to forgive and understand her mother.<br /><br />A tragic chain of events starts with Mr. Hamilton’s daughter’s discovery of the affair, and continues with Cora’s husband coming to demand her return. These events culminate in a manner that neither of the three women would have even imagined.<br /><br />This is a dark book, with each woman’s life surrounded by violence of some sort, but hope still manages to shine through that darkness. Sharratt has written a many layered story, where joy and despair live side by side. Despite the rocky, difficult path that came before, the reader and the characters end with a feeling of “all’s well\\".<br /><br />My major complaint with The Real Minerva is Sharratt’s sometimes strained attempts to tie the story to The Odyssey, with many references and quotes. To me, this just didn’t quite work with the rest of the novel, it felt out of place.<br /><br />Despite that, it is a well-written novel with some especially good and quite original descriptive phrases. My favorite is found on page one, “Irene’s hot breath, smelling of breakfast bacon, fanned Penny’s cheeks\\". In addition, her depiction of the bonds of mother love and of female friendship was particularly apt and stirring.

Furthermore, her writing style is light and makes a normal dry subject (the ancient Athenian judicial system) interesting and comprehensible.<br /><br />Neaira was a prostitute in the 4th century, who grew up in Corinth and eventually found herself in a stable relationship as the long-time mistress of an influential Athenian, Stephanos. Unfortunately, Stephanos had an equally influential enemy (or at least rival) Apollodoros. They battled back and forth in the courts, and eventually Apollodoros hit on a different way to attack Stephanos--through Neaira.<br /><br />Athenian laws were quite strict about foreigners and allowed no intermarriage. Apollodoros set out to prove that Neaira was living with Stephanos as his wife, instead of as his mistress, and that their children were being given the rights of Athenian citizens--which, as Neaira's children, they never could be.<br /><br />Using Apollodoros speech to the jury, Hamel recreates Neaira's life, while using other sources to fill out the story with interesting details about prostitution, jury duty, social customs and Athenian law.*<br /><br />Hamel approaches Neaira's life (via the speech) as a detective would, piecing together bits, shifting out obvious falsehoods, and in the end presenting a surprising full picture of one woman's life.<br /><br />This is an excellent book for anyone who is, or who is NOT, interested in ancient Athenian law. I, myself, had not the least curiosity in said subject and yet found myself fascinated, all the while being constantly entertained by her sly wit and bizarre trivia. I learned enough from this book to become quite interested in Athenian history and I feel it will have the same effect on any other casual historian.<br /><br />*to qoute from the Preface:<br />Apollodoros'speech, inevitably hostile to Neaira, must be the principal source for her biography, though we will need very often to question and reject the information he provides. Where what he tells us is not inherently unlikely, however, or contradicted by other sources, and when lying about the issue under discussion would not have furthered the prosecution's case, we can feel reasonably confident about accepting Apollodoros'testimony. Fleshing out Neaira's story, too, will require frequent dips into other source material.we will need very often to question and reject the information he provides.

He claims he did not do it, but he has no remembrance of the evening at all.<br /><br />Akitada is just returning to Heian Kyo from several years as a provincial governor, and present the temple on the night of the murder.  He hears a woman scream that evening, but it is not until several days later that he learns of the crime.  Despite Inspector Kobe's reluctance, Akitada turns his deductive skills to the case, while also trying to remove his own brother-in-law out of a bit of a potentially ruining situation.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Akitada's servant, the womanizing Tora, decides to prove his deductive prowess, and find \\"the slasher\\" that is mutilating women in the Pleasure Quarters.  He has seen the slasher's work and is determined to stop him.<br /><br />As with the first Akitada novel, there is a lot going on.  But, Ms. Parker pulls it off with style and intelligence.  The descriptions of eleventh-century Japan are detailed, and yet casual so that the reader doesn't feel that history is being pushed down the throat.  Akitada and his friends and family are convincingly real and the plot is credible.<br /><br />On the whole, this five star mystery is a worthy successor to (also five star) Rashomon Gate and Ms. Parker keeps rising in my esteem as a gifted author.	2004-08-28

It follows the lives of five prominent English courtesans (Sophia Baddeley, Elizabeth Armistead, Harriette Wilson, Cora Pearl and Catherine Walters), giving an individual biography of each woman. The biography then forms the center of the social history, as Hickman shows British society of that time in relation to the particular courtesan--with the exception of Cora Pearl, who spent most of her time in Paris and therefore it is Parisian society that is explored.<br /><br /> Cora Pearl<br /><br /> Though there are many other courtesans equally as well-known, Hickman focused only one from each epoch of British society. She then gave briefer biographies of that courtesans friends and rivals as part of the social history.<br /><br /> Though short, each biography is excellently done and with them Hickman gives a surprisingly detailed account of London social life--the demi-monde as well as &quot;real&quot; society--over a period of nearly 150 years. Birth control, women's rights, and prostitution also receive in depth treatment by Hickman, as she constructs social history around these famous ladies.<br /><br /> Hickman shows the world that is excluded from most histories and thereby the reader is able to construct a fuller picture of the world of high society in London from the time of George III throughout the early 1900's. I can not recommend this book highly enough to anyone interested in the social history of Britain during these times.	2004-08-05

Many of these authors are long out of print, and there were several with whom I was completely unfamiliar.<br /><br /> There were of course, stories by Doyle, Orczy and Chesterton to represent the more traditional favorites--Chesterton's &quot;The Eye of Apollo&quot; is especially excellent. Several of the other stories were surprisingly deep and well-written, though there were also a few truly dreadfully written stories, that were quite popular in their day, and reading them was fun in a different way. (I'll not give my opinion as to which stories were which, so as not to influence other readers.)<br /><br /> Overall, this is an excellent set of Victorian stories, giving a wide range of styles and tastes, with a short biography of the author at the start of the story. For anyone who enjoys Victorian lit, these stories (especially the lesser known gems among them) will make a wonderful read.	2004-08-03

He's more of a multi-personality. Sky has several facets of himself which he becomes by donning various disguises. Dennis, for example, is a computer nerd and math expert and just by wearing Dennis' glasses, Sky can solve complex mathematical problems and break into computers. These six personalities are very handy for a detective and Sky wears them all--including Lulu--with an ease that is nearly scary.<br /><br /> Sometimes he thinks he might be overdoing it a bit, but the multi-personality thing takes back burner to his real problem--tap-dancing. Yes, Sky is a problem dancer, and hasn't been attending his meetings regularly. At any moment, with his resistance this low, he could duck into an all night karaoke tap club and--well, let's just say that the results wouldn't be pretty.<br /><br /> On top of it all, he's got work to do. He's trailing his high school nemesis to see if he's cheating on his wife and while still in the middle of this case, a lovely blonde bombshell of a computer programmer needs help with a murder case. Seems that some disgruntled nerd is killing computer program &quot;documentalists&quot;. Her brother is a prime suspect and she wants to prove his innocence and find the real killer. Soon the killer becomes a serial killer and Sky--and the rest of him--must find out the whys and whos.<br /><br /> This is a very witty novel, with some sidesplitting read-out-loud happenings (the first use of the juicer, for instance, still makes me laugh). The mystery is not nearly as interesting as Sky's detecting and the solving of the case was a bit lame. Despite all that, I enjoyed it, passed in on to Stoney and refer it to anyone who likes their mystery to be slightly wacky and a whole lot of fun.	2004-08-03

The mores and manners of their time are apparent in all of the stories--as is the sometimes contradictory belief in both established religion and the supernatural.<br /><br /> These are not horror stories, nor are they all &quot;ghost stories&quot; in the truest sense of the phrase. They are, rather, a slice of Victorian life, told through the female voice with a strength that is sometimes surprising.<br /><br /> I enjoyed them all immensely (with the exception of the dull bit of poetry) and recommend them to any fan of Victorian lit.	2004-08-03

I love them and I'm not ashamed to admit. I enjoy nearly every British Victorian author I can find--with the notable exception of Dickens (*gag*) and Emily Bronte (who was NOT the best Bronte writer by a long-shot)--and Collins is one of my true favorites. From the supernatural to the just plain mean, from true love to deadly love, from. . .well, from any hackneyed plot device to any other hackneyed plot device, you can find it in Collins, and well written, too! (Of course, one must remember that many of the trite plot devices were not so well-used when he penned them.)<br /><br />These three novellas give an excellent example of the varied nature of his stories. Miss or Mrs? is a story of true love, unrequited love, greed, dark deeds, and clandestine marriage featuring one of the most insipid heroines I've seen yet. And still I enjoyed it.<br /><br />The Haunted Hotel is a truly estimable work of fiction. In it Collins combines the supernatural with a truly interesting mystery and a rather sweet love story subplot. He pits human goodness against human evil with a heroine that is almost as strong and brave as she is good. One must remember the times, though, and not expect her to NOT faint away from time to time. This was my second reading of this novella and I liked it even better this time. It's truly complex and twisty and quite enjoyable.<br /><br />With The Guilty River, Collins leaves the supernatural dangers and shows his readers what can happen to someone suddenly and cripplingly handicapped. . . If that someone is willing to give in to his immoral side, that is. Like the other three, love is a prominent theme, featuring another dangerous triangle of lovers.<br /><br />The Haunted Hotel is by far the best of the three, but the others are still enjoyable enough to those who like Victorian literature. If one is reading them and expecting them to be comparable with modern books--DON'T. Collins, as with all Victorian writers, must be read in the spirit it was written to be fully enjoyed.<br /><br />sparable with modern books--DON'T.

Little does Nadia know that by bringing Kali-Ra and her creator Valerian Ricardo back into the public eye, she'll be setting the stage for. . . a lot of people to come tramping into her life with demands!<br /><br /> Nick Iverson, average guy with a philosophy degree, has just discovered he's Ricardo's heir. Or would be if Ricardo's wife, Lila were dead. Which she isn't. She's very much alive and trying to spread Valerian's &quot;message&quot; to the masses. But that won't benefit either of them monetarily as the book is public domain now and no one owns the rights.<br /><br /> Or do they? It appears some heavy handed fat guy in a Speedo living in some foreign county not only has the rights, but he's sending his goons--a nervous lawyer and an aged lounge singer to be exact--to get his money.<br /><br /> Into this mix, add one Doctor of Literature, who wrote his thesis on Valerian, one burnt-out script writer who just wants some peace and a good drink, a mysterious hot young thing named Callie, and Melanie, Nadia's manager and general dog's body--the only really sane one of the bunch. Stir in one murder, a missing security man and some cheesy pulp fiction and you've got The Revenge of Kali-Ra!<br /><br /> In this tongue-in-cheek, laugh-out-loud novel, Beck manages, easily and credibly, to bring together all these bizarre and seemingly unrelated characters. The story generally flows well and employs a few twists and turns that would have made any pulp author proud. Over all, this is a fun, breezy book and well-worth a read.	2004-07-26

Hermux leads a normal, predictable life with disagreements with the disagreeable female across the hall, clock repairs for housewives with naughty children, daily donuts and coffee for the 10 am snack and evenings spent with his pet ladybug.<br />That is he did, until Ms. Linka Perflinger, Adventuress, enters his shop one day for an emergency watch repair. Hermux is smitten and when she doesn't appear at the scheduled time to pick up the watch, he becomes worried.<br />With his attempts to make sure that she is okay, Hermux becomes involved in a mystery of kidnapping, health potions and murder. He must step out of his comfortable existence, and take risks like never before if he is to save Ms. Perflinger--and himself.<br />On the surface, this is a cute novel with cute fuzzy little rodents and birds living and working in a fantasy world, wearing clothes and eating at restaurants. The mystery itself is nothing fantastic, with the outcome obvious to a mature reader, though not necessarily so to the intended age group.<br />Hermux himself was an appealing character, rich with emotions and life. The villains were much less so, resembling any cartoon villain. The world Hoeye created for Hermux was a sweet, comfortable world--a little too unreal, trite and happy for my enjoyment.<br />My biggest complaint is not unique to this book and is one that I share with many other readers--this unfortunate tendency towards unpronounceable names in fantasy/sci fi books. Why? I mean, really, WHY? With this book in particular, it made out-loud reading difficult and added another layer of triteness to what was otherwise a not bad book.<br />Though I did not find it completely satisfying, I think that my ten year old daughter and those of her age group would probably find it delightful with just enough mystery and suspense.	2004-07-14

She is a bit like Austen, with a sharp eye for human behavior and peccadilloes, and in that not much happens in her novels, but one expectantly turns the pages anyway*.<br />Her wry, sometimes dark and yet still gentle humor prevails in Seducers in Ecuador. Mr. Lomax has become caught up in the beauty and lack of reality that comes with wearing blue spectacles. The feelings of ease created by these spectacles accumulate in marriage, murder and the scaffold--as Sackville-West tells the reader in the first pages.<br />The Heir is a completely different type of novella. It is love story of a man for a house. Mr. Chase, a soulless insurance branch-manager, inherits a Manor that is to his mind impractical and in need of being sold. A gradual change over takes him as he falls desperately in love with the house and yet watches the sale proceed.<br />Both novellas are enjoyable, in Sackville-West's particular style-- seemingly gentle and unobtrusive while hiding her piercing social commentary. If you've never read any of her works, Seducers in Ecuador would be an especially good one with which to start.<br />____________________<br />*&quot;Nothing very much happens in her (Austen's) books, and yet, when you come to the bottom of a page, you eagerly turn it to learn what will happen next.

Only, she's already sold it for considerable profit.<br />What happens next is a fast-paced, non-stop hilariously horrible race to get the book and return it, hopefully staying alive throughout the whole adventure. And adventure it is--improbable, violent, and extremely funny.<br />Jill reminds me of a wise-cracking Film Noir detective. . . except for the fact that she says and does things that even Spade wouldn't!

What Harriet finds is an Anne unrecognizable from her best friend and former roommate. . . an Anne so dominated by Victor and his subtle (and some not so subtle) controls that she ceases to have an identity of her own and exists merely as Victor's mistress.<br />Harriet desperately wants to rescue Anne from what she perceives as a harmful relationship. Anne is uncertain as to her to own desires and motives. Victor, the forceful former-Auschwitz survivor, has his own agenda. This odd triangle reaches the point-of-no-return as the reader waits to see just what will happen.<br />The novel is written in three parts. Book One is a journal of sorts, in which Harriet records her concerns for Anne, along with her observations of Anne and Victor. She writes this journal in letters addressed to her boyfriend, Benedict, and uses it as a sounding board for her concerns and frustrations. This is by far the best part of the book. Harriet's observations are witty and scintillating, and at the same time piercing, as she tries to penetrate through Anne's &quot;strange new mistress/person&quot;.<br />Books Two and Three are told in third person. Book Two fleshes out Harriet's personality by giving her family background and childhood stories, cumulating in a situation not dissimilar from the one she faces now. Book Three picks up where Harriet's journal leaves off and follows Anne and Victor and Harriet to the conclusion.<br />I was disappointed by Anne's character. Even knowing that her true personality was being overshadowed by Victor, I never caught so much as a glimpse of &quot;her&quot;. She appeared two-dimensional and I did not find myself as concerned for her as I should. Harriet, on the other hand, was a delightful character, full of life and enthusiasm and spirit.

I was a bit disappointed to begin with, as the first hundred pages or so are Galileo's early biography. Once his daughter, Virginia (later Suor Marie Celeste) came into the picture, the story became much more interesting.<br />Virginia was one of Galileo's three illegitimate children by the mistress of his early years, Marina Gamba. She eventually married, with Galileo's blessings, and he never lost interest in his children. Due to their illegitimacy which he felt would eliminate any chance of a decent marriage, Galileo had his two daughters entered into a convent at a very early age. The both became nuns at the convent of San Matteo on turning sixteen, Virginia taking the name Suor Marie Celeste and Livia that of Suor Arcangela. The son, Vincenzio, lived with Galileo in his late teens and eventually (after an unpromising start) became a good son to him.<br />This book recounts Galileo's personal and private life, using letters from Marie Celeste to give color to what would otherwise be a black and white, straight forward biography. Their shared love is beautiful to see in her letters--his to her having been lost--and the bits and pieces of every day life that she treats the reader to are thoroughly enjoyable.<br />This is a very detailed and readable history of Galileo, and gave me a much greater understanding of the man, his work and his difficulty with the Church. The conflict he felt between himself and his discoveries comes through very clearly and poignantly in his own words through his other letters. Her faith in him, and in the fact that he was not being heretical, is very apparent. It was interesting to me to see how differently Sobel portrays Galileo's fight was the Church--if her sources are to be believed (and I see no reason to disbelieve) it was not at all what history textbooks would have us believe.<br />As a history major and fanatic, I truly enjoyed reading this book. The alternate perspective of Galileo was refreshing and real--and made sense of a lot that had previously seemed murky to me about him and the Church. The addition of Marie Celeste's letters gave this book personality and took Galileo from a science god to a human being. My only regret is how few letters are in this book, and that the title is a bit misleading.

He is on unofficial business, and not there to help the local officials sort out the case of the serial killer known as The Whistler. Though touted as \\"An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery\\", it is not really. He is a minor character, there more to give continuity than to contribute to the novel.<br />Dalgliesh stumbles on a murdered victim, copycat-killed to look like The Whistler's work and becomes the sounding block for Inspector Rickards as he sorts through the likely candidates and motives. The victim is not well-liked and therefore the list of suspects would be rather large except for one thing: The Whistler's particular signature was known by only a few people.<br />As is unique in this genre and yet typical of all P. D. James novels, the characters are well-rounded and well-known before the actual murder takes place. (It was page 154 before the crucial murder was committed.) James delves deep into the mind of these people, and I felt I knew them--even cared for some of them--and was disturbed as I saw bits and pieces of evidence. There were several characters that I just did NOT want to be the murderer!<br />Also typical of James is the realism and complexity of the plot and characters. I have yet to have read a mystery by her that did not satisfy me as a reader, and yet at the same time stirred my emotions in some fashion. I vividly remember one of her novels, in which the perpetrator did not come to justice. I agonized over that one for days. Devices and Desires does not have anything that traumatic, but still left me hung-over in the plot for a day or two later.<br />On a side note, in this novel Larksoken is home to a nuclear power plant. Written in 1989, James uses this as her vehicle to air both sides of the nuclear power question. It is intelligently done and she reaches no conclusion, gives neither side her full approval.<br />I can not recommend P. D. James highly enough to anyone who enjoys mysteries.

He works as a law clerk in the Ministry of Law to support his mother and sisters and small household. A former, and very beloved professor, comes to him with a perplexing problem--someone at the university is being blackmailed. Being known for his acumen and problem-solving abilities, Akitada is asked to help. Soon, by being in the wrong place at the wrong time, Akitada is involved not only with blackmail.  He's gottwo murders and another suspicious death to solve.<br />Far from being overwhelmed by too much going on, the novel is an excellent mystery and maintains a good balance between all the plot facets. More importantly, Parker didn't take all these various mysteries and tie them together in one nice solution. I hate it when an author takes two different mysteries and makes the connect together in the end. . . it always seems to me that the author got tired of writing and made a quick and easy out, at the reader's expense. Parker does not do this. All the problems are complex and solved mostly independent of each other.<br />Though this is the first novel featuring Akitada, he already has a reputation. I don't know if Parker means to slowly let us in on Akitada's past, or if it was all revealed in the Shamus Award winning short story &quot;Akitada's First Case&quot;, published three years prior to this novel. Not having read the short story, or any other Akitada novels, I'm not sure of the author's intention. I found it confusing at times, when, for example, Akitada knew some characters well, and yet the reader was not let in on the relationship. This, for me, detracted some from my enjoyment<br />Despite that, this was a really good novel. Akitada and the other characters--especially Tora, his servant and fellow problem solver--were well written, and the subtle touches of Ancient Japan made for interesting reading. Parker's intelligent and sometimes humorous writing and plot made for an excellent mystery.g and plot made for an excellent mystery.	2004-07-02

His satire and his wit, along with his wonderful ability to capture human personality with words, introduced me to a whole new standard of literature in my college days.  I read everything he had written, or so I thought, until I stumbled on a few books at the local used bookstore several years ago--and before my introduction to the world of Amazon.com.  I don't know why it took me so long to pick up The Loved One, but I'm so glad I finally did!<br />Dennis Barlow is a young Brit, brought over to Hollywood for his poetic skills.  When his contract is not renewed, far from being horror-stricken like his fellow ex-patriots, he simply takes another job, with the intention of returning to poetry on the side.  What happens afterward is a morbidly humorous tale on which I can not expound for fear of ruining it for you.  I can say that it includes a cosmetician, a mortician, Whispering Glades Memorial Park, a parrot and a few famous poems.  Oh, and lots of typical Waugh black humor that will have you laughing out loud, re-reading, and thoroughly enjoying yourself at the expense of the characters, dead and alive.<br />I've read all but two of Waugh's novels, and I must say that this one tops even Scoop as my favorite!	2004-07-02

His mother's wealthy cousin (Dreyer) has kindly agreed to take him on in his department store.  What neither Dreyer nor Franz has considered is that Mrs. Martha Dreyer would also kindly consent to take him on as her lover.  It takes a little planning on her part, but finally the shy, lanky Franz becomes her secret lover, her ticket to a world without Dreyer.<br />King, Queen, Knave is a typical triangle love story.  And yet, it's not.  Nabokov, even in this early novel, has an excellent feel for human beings, what makes them do what they do and just how much they can stand.  Franz and Martha's relationship moves from the sublime to the detestable for Franz, while he becomes a lifeline to Martha.  Dreyer, seeing good in all the world, is easily duped--though easily duping Martha on the side.<br />As with Lolita, the plot is not all that great, and I can't truly say I \\"enjoyed\\" the book.  But nonetheless, I couldn't stop reading it.  I had to continue watching the dynamics change between the King, the Queen and the Knave and see just how the hand was played out.	2004-07-02

While he is there, Lord Monfort is found dead, though by his own hand or that of a murderer is unclear.  Monfort's close associate, Lord Foley is given the task of sorting it all out and, having noticed Nate's exceptional observational skills, requests his help.  Nate slowly unravels the mystery, often missing the truth all together.  Eventually  he is successful in unraveling both the mystery of Monfort and of Nate's friend John Partridge.<br />Gleeson's first novel has a real feel for London (and the surrounding countryside) in 1755 and it's apparent that she has done her research.  Her writing is good and the mystery itself is compelling and interesting.  I found flaw with a few important details, though--the leeches for example, and Madame Trenti for another.  I won't be more specific, as I don't want to spoil the novel, so suffice it to say that there were several bits where the \\"answer\\" just was not answer enough for me.<br />Stylistically, too, the book is a bit flawed.  According to the letter preface, the entire book is written from Nate to Alice, to tell her all that happened.  However, Nate gives details that, given his character, he would not have told Alice.  Nearly to the end of the book, he gives the manuscript to Alice, and yet continues to write it afterwards, which felt messy and unbelievable and simply did not flow well.  Furthermore, in his preface, Nate mentions a desk that neither he nor Alice had seen at the time he wrote the letter--if we are to take in account the point where he stops writing, gives Alice the manuscript and then continues writing later.  It was after this second bout of writing that the desk is seen.<br />Don't let me put you off this book, though, with my criticisms.  It's still a good read, highly enjoyable and just winding enough to satisfy most mystery lovers.	2004-07-02

However, as the novel progressed it began to falter and become uninteresting. The further along I got, the harder it was to press on.  Of course, by the middle of the book, I felt I had invested too much time to put it aside unread.<br />I found the Lady Utsu unlovable and I couldn't get at all interested in her fate or future. Furthermore, her actions in the latter part of the book were incompatible with her personality and the lack of change to be found in her. Not to spoil it, and hopefully this bit won't, but how could a woman like her find contentment in a hermit existence? She couldn't and didn't, even her actions show that. Schaeffer seems to be the only one who didn't realize that, as her writing suggests .<br />Matsuhito was more lovable, but less dynamic. He was exactly what one would expect a samurai to be. . . but without realistic emotions, actions and reactions. It was only his love for the little fox that made me warm to him. As a matter of a fact, the story of the foxes was the only thing that made me press on through the last few chapters--though I will admit to skimming a bit through there.<br />Lord Norimasa, on the other hand, was a warlord of vitality and personality. He was the only well-rounded personality in the book, and I enjoyed all his scenes. His interactions with the old councilor, his wife, Matsuhito and Lady Utsu showed difference and depth. Schaeffer did well with Norimasa and I regret that he was not in the novel more.<br />The book is supposed to be told by the daughter of Utsu and Matsuhito, who never knew them and never knew their story until she was an adult. She is telling it from some scrolls that supposedly record their history. Given that, how is she (the daughter) able to record their thoughts and motives? Very unlikely, very weak plot device. Furthermore, the book switches from event to event in a jarring, rough way that is hard to follow. Schaeffer obscures the identity of some characters, to add a bit of mystery I suppose. All it does is make those parts of the book unintelligible or ridiculous.<br />I'm giving this book 2 stars instead of 1 solely because I enjoyed Lord Norimasa and I enjoyed the story of the foxes. . . and because it was better than sitting down in front of a sit-com. Others may--and many have--enjoy it. I, however, have read many books that were much better and not so many that were much worse.dult.

None of the villagers connect her, a 65 year old widow, respectable though peculiar, with the skinny kid that was run out of the village with her mother and two siblings some fifty years prior. She's Mirabelle Dartigen's daughter. . . if they only knew.<br />In her return &quot;home&quot; Boise must face the past and sort out what happened to her enigmatic mother. The album, with it's clippings and cryptic writing, leads her to discoveries about her mother that shock her and change her whole view of who her mother was.<br />At the same time, Boise relives her own life, especially that pivotal summer. This, side by side with her discoveries from the album, form a full picture of what did happen, answer some of her questions and give the reader a story told in patchwork that, when fit together, makes a lovely quilt of story.<br />The story is told in the first person, going back and forth from Boise's childhood to her current struggle with first the village and then her relatives. It transitions smoothly, the story is firm and real--and like the oranges that play such a crucial role, the scent of the story lingers for some time after the reading.<br />The main plot was a well-used one, and as such disappointed me a bit. Harris managed to make up for that, though, with her style which kept me intrigued even during the most obvious bits. Over all the novel was a good one and I look forward to reading for her other two novels.	2004-06-16

Many years have passed since Alais' hopes and dreams were dashed with the sudden end of her betrothal to her beloved Richard. Prince Henry has died, King Henry has died and so has King Richard. Alais lives in Paris, attached to the court of her brother the King and dissatisfied with her life, wanting a change.<br />It is in this state of mind that a letter from Queen Eleanor reaches her, requesting her help. John is now King of England and, not surprisingly, unrest is whispering it's way from one end of the kingdom to the other. Eleanor fears that certain letters she wrote years ago could harm John's rule, if they come to light. She wants Alais to cross the channel, visit Canterbury Cathedral and recover the letters. In return, Eleanor offers Alais certain information. She has not misjudged her stepdaughter. Alais will face the risks for this information.<br />What transpires is a suspenseful web, with John, his enemies, a special pendant and Alais' history all interwoven, told from Alais' point of view with humor and emotion. The result is an exceptional historical mystery from a first-time author that I want to hear from again--and soon!	2004-06-11

At one stop, the midwife takes her on as apprentice and Beetle's life changes dramatically. The midwife is by no means a gentle mother figure, but she feeds Beetle regularly and the life is not hard.<br />The reader follows Beetle (or Alyce as she later calls herself) as she matures, sheds her insecurities, becomes self-confident and self-loving, and finally learns to face up to and conquer her fears. It's a very positive tale, excellent for young girls who need to see positive female role-models face problems and succeed by sheer determination--and not fairy godmothers or money or good looks.<br />While unconsciously absorbing these lessons, young readers will also find themselves learning about Medieval Europe. Cushman manages to slide historical facts in so casually that the reader will come away knowing about Medieval customs and practices, the art of early midwifery and life in a village.<br />This is an excellent tale, well-written, witty and touching. I enjoyed it on many levels and would recommend it (along with Cushman's other excellent novel, Catherine Called Birdy) for pre-teens and teens--and adults like me who enjoy a light story with a postitive girl character.	2004-06-09

Fitzgerald knows Florence. . . Steven King (and probably others) says that some of his stories have a life of their own and come to him fully formed and all he does is write them down. Fitzgerald writes as if she had lived the story herself.<br />The Bookshop is not a &quot;comedy of manners&quot;, but there is still an Austin flavor to The Bookshop--it is a softly humorous character study in which not a whole lot happens. Regardless of that, I had to turn the page, had to continue my relationship with Florence and the town of Hardborough.<br />The plot is simply that Florence, after being widowed, decides to open a bookstore in Hardborough. She's only lived there eight years, and as such is still a newcomer, which might account for some of the resistance met in her venture. Between a poltergeist, an angry Community Chairwoman, a general stubbornness of Hardborough to accept her shop, and normal business woes, Florence finds the path to being a bookseller is not a smooth one. The Bookshop has no great plot climax, no surprises or thrills, no exciting endings. . .it's just life, Florence's life, and as such is a gentle and pleasant read ,though not &quot;light&quot; for it has elements of the tragic to it. I look forward to reading Fitzgerald's other novels.	2004-06-08

He suffers from \\"chronic displacement\\" and incurable genetic disease.<br />One moment Henry be at working in the library, shelving books in the back stacks and the next moment he'll unwillingly find himself shivering, naked, and usually throwing-up, in some other part of time.  He has visited himself at various ages, seen his parents in the early days of their marriage, and re-witnessed tragedies.  He has also visited his wife, in her youth, long before they met.  Matter of a fact, though they didn't meet in chronological years until he was twenty-eight and she twenty, she meet him when she was six and he was in his thirties, and already married to her in his real time.<br />He continues to visit Clare throughout her childhood, influencing--albeit unwittingly--her view of the world.  She grew up knowing that when she did meet Henry in real time, they would marry. . . She was simply waiting.<br />Though the story is about Henry, it's really Clare's story.  The story of waiting, of longing, of love.  There is not a lot about Henry's time traveling experiences, except when they affect Clare or are momentous and life changing for him.<br />This isn't a sci-fi or even a fantasy.  His \\"chronological displacement\\" is treated matter-of-factly, and the immense trouble it causes him merely alluded to over the course of the novel.  The Time Traveler's Wife is instead a moving and often tragic love story and one that I (an anti-romance reader) found engrossing and real.<br />Sure, there were bits that were totally unbelievable to me--and they never had anything to do with time travel.  Sex and miscarriages, for example, were given an unreal treatment.  The one detail that I found most annoying was the description of a friend's Downs child.  Having worked so closely with special needs, I knew that the child Niffenegger describes is an autistic child, not a Downs child.  Why this was distracting, being such a small point, I don't know but it was.  It--added to the unreal sex and miscarriages--managed to somehow lessen her credibility for me.<br />The only other complaint I had was the needless complication with Gomez.  Those who have read the book will understand and those that haven't can find out for themselves, I shan't spoil it.  But, I have to ask--did Henry and Clare have enough things going on without adding that element?

How do I review this book in more than the one word &quot;wow!&quot;?<br />Charlie Monk is specialist, a killer for a government agency so high it has no name. He's the best of the best--he does his job perfectly and asks no questions. Or at least, he didn't.<br />When he runs into an old friend, things start to go odd with his life. Charlie starts to question things. . . things that others higher up apparently don't want questioned.<br />What might sound like the run-of-the-mill action thriller is anything BUT run-of-the-mill. What Charlie discovers is earthshaking for him. He is delivered one shattering punch after the other, and the reader shares the shock of those punches.<br />The only flaw I could find in this novel was the occasional absence of description and that sometimes too much happens at one time. Both of these are common in this genre and in no way lessened my enjoyment of this fantastic book. Sure, it's not a literary gem like Pride and Prejudice or Lolita or Rebecca, but it is simply one of the best novels I've ever read. I picked it up, on a whim, thinking that my husband might like it. Turns out we both did!<br />I'd love to tell you more. I wish I could give you the reasons that I read this book through in one evening, but I can't ruin it for you.

It begins with Marian giving her back story. She is the orphan of landed nobility, and as a result is the ward of the Crown. She is married at five, though by seventeen she had yet to take her place as wife in her husband's home. With his death, she becomes a widow and a pawn for Queen Eleanor who needs all the marriageable land she can find to make alliances for her son, the new King Richard.<br />Marian hears that news of her impending marriage has been put in a letter and, desperate to know her fate, she makes a bold move. She enters Sherwood Forest in search of the illustrious Robin Hood, to enlist his aid to discover what is in that letter.<br />Robin Hood does in fact help her, and armed with foreknowledge Marian returns home to form a plan that will deliver her from unwanted marriage, and allow her to keep her lands. She is unsuccessful and, to her surprise, Robin Hood turns up on her wedding morning and whisks her off to Sherwood Forest. Thus begins their friendship and with it, the start of a gentle courtship.<br />This is Marian's story, not Robin Hood's, and as such there is very little of the legendary hero in this novel. His exploits are barely mentioned, when mentioned at all, and no real attempt is made to give life to his band or to show his outlaw side. He is just Robin, Marian's help in distress, her friend and later her love. I found this to be disappointing--instead of showing any difficulties in Marian having to adjust to Robin Hood's lifestyle, Watson merely had him move in two separate planes--Marian's life and his life.<br />The last quarter of the book was the least believable. Marian goes to live with a farming family and is able to deceive them into thinking that she is of their class. Then, Marian becomes a servant and is equally able to convince the lady of the house of her servant status while worming her way into her mistresses confidence. Watson gives Marian's stay in Sherwood Forest as the reason she succeeds in these deceptions, but I find it extremely difficult to believe that a woman raised as nobility for 19 years would be convincing in those roles after a few months of helping out in a camp.<br />It ends with an unrealistic series of events that lead to the successful, and easy, return of lands to Marian. A weak ending, with all loose ends rushing forward to be tied, that left me unsatisfied.<br />Despite these weaknesses, Maid Marian is a good read, light and enjoyable. The back story is especially well written, giving good flavor of life in Queen Eleanor's court and a sturdy, convincing background for Marian. Part romance, part adventure, it would make a good book for carefree summer reading.rian's stay in Sherwood Forest as the reason she succeeds in these deceptions, but I find it extremely difficult to believe that a woman raised as nobility for 19 years would be convincing in those roles after a few months of helping out in a camp.<br />It ends with an unrealistic series of events that lead to the successful, and easy, return of lands to Marian.

Every child's fantasy is to live in a super-cool place, at least it was mine, and I remember reading this is a child and being SO envious. To live in a museum! Even if for only a week! And to work on the mystery of an statue! Wow! I loved it.<br />Happily enough, the magic had not worn off when I re-read it today. In Claudia and James, Konigsburg has created real kids, with real emotions and actions. The plot is exciting enough to hold attention, while still maintaining a sense of \\"this could've really happened!\\".<br />There was no moral lesson to be learned it this book--Claudia and James run away and nothing bad happens to them. Matter of fact, they succeed and are rewarded. For that reason, I suppose a bit of parental reminding that running away is dangerous and wouldn't happen like it does in books might be advisable.<br />Otherwise, it's an enjoyable read for adults and children alike and just might stir up an interest in art and museums. Books that encourage kids to have an interest history or art (like The Egypt Game) need to be recommended as highly as possible. This one will stir the imagination of any receptive child and might start a life-long enthusiasm--it was one of the starting blocks for me.	2004-05-23

Rebellious and artistic, she has trouble fitting in with her siblings. Rather than face a life in the convent, she agrees to marry Cristoforo an older man, who luckily turns out to be of artistic temperament, too, and is very tolerant of her. Her life is also inexplicably tied to that of the painter (whose name she does not even know) hired to paint her father's chapel.<br />This base storyline is one that anyone who has read any historical fiction has read at least once. Some female, in some country, at some historical time period, exhibits some artistic talent but it is repressed for some reason. *sigh*<br />But, despite that, Dunant managed to weave a beautiful tale of Alessandra and of Florence. She did so well, in fact, that I was in the middle of the story before I realized that the main plot might actually be the fascinating history of Florence at the turn of the 16th century, as shown through those who lived it.<br />Florence's turbulent change from &quot;New Athens&quot; to New Jerusalem and back to a broken city was lightly and easily told and gave a colorful, realistic background to Dunant's tale of art, love and life. This was easily the best part of the book. I did not come to care about the characters nearly as much as I came to be curious about Florence.<br />My other gripe was that after finishing the book, I had yet to discover the reason for the title. Venus' birth was mentioned only in relation to Botticelli's painting, nothing else. If Ms. Dunant decides to republish under a different title, allow me to humbly suggest The Serpent of Eve as an alternate. (Those who have read the book will immediately see the reason, just as they, too, are probably pondering the current title.)<br />Overall, I would rate this book as a 3--a good read, but I would not go out of my way to recommend it or to read other books by Dunant	2004-05-23

Thursday mistakenly assumes that this will give her a peaceful year in which to be pregnant, have the child of a man that never existed, and decide just how to get that man's existence back.<br />Jurisfiction (the policing agency of the fiction world) turns out to be much more exciting than anticipated, what with the Pro Catherine faction trying to kill Heathcliff, the Minotaur disappearing and something odd and dangerous going on with the new UltraWord testings--not to mention the everyday adventures of training under Miss Havisham!<br />On top of that, she's billeting two Generics in her home, attempting to defeat a memory thief, studying for her Jurisfiction exam, having morning sickness, presenting the Bookie for &quot;Best Chapter Opening in the English Language&quot; and giving advice to a lady gorilla.<br />Sure, the storyline's a bit unbelievable, there's a lot to keep up with, and I didn't always get the jokes, but all in all The Well of Lost Plots is another gem! Fforde keeps the funnies coming so fast, it's hard to breathe in between them. His Douglas Adams-esq humor, literary jokes and just darn good writing skills make this an A-1 book! But remember, you MUST read The Eyre Affair and Lost in a Good Book before attempting this one.

Gentlemen Prefer Blondes has long been one of my favorite movies, so I was tickled to discover that it was a magazine serial first. Until I stumbled across the book, I had just assumed that Loos wrote it for the screen.<br /><br />Lorelei is a beautiful blonde with a conflicting amount of predatory logic, downright dumbness and a deep conviction of her own intelligence. The book is the journal she kept during the few months she was traveling abroad (Mr. Eisman is &#34;educating&#34; her) with her friend Dorothy, who &#34;really does not care about her mind and I always scold her because she does nothing but waste her time by going around with gentlemen who do not have anything&#34;.<br /><br />Mr. Eisman (never called Gus, because &#34;when a gentleman who is as important as Mr. Eisman, spends quite a lot of money educating a girl, it really does not show reverence to call a gentleman by his first name&#34;) makes the mistake of not going with Lorelei, and so with just Dorothy to chaperone, she makes conquests of kind rich men all across Europe.<br /><br />Loos has written an amusing story, and though at times I got tired of the purposeful misspellings and grammatical errors, I enjoyed it from beginning to end. The few not-as-interesting parts were completely forgotten as soon as I read another one of Loos' little gems such as &#34;Well, it's been three days since my debut party started but I finally got tired and left the party last night and went to bed because I always seem to lose all of my interest in a party after a few days&#34; or &#34;So, she found a box of liqueur candies that are full of liqueurs and she was really very delighted. So I finally got dressed and she threw the empty box away and I helped her down stairs to the Dining room.&#34;<br /><br />If you've seen the movie, you should definitely read this as it gives a little more depth to Lorelei. If you've not, the book will still be a fun trip back to the 20's where bootleggers, gold diggers and millionaires party side by side.y side by side.	2004-05-16

Instead of turning the Greek myth into a fairy tale, she's created a delightfully unbelievable, far-fetched and bizarre &quot;tall tale&quot;.<br />Many of the elements of a fairy tale are there--the wicked stepmother, the beautiful heroine, the naive and loving father, the handsome hero--but these are overshadowed by tall tale traits such as the superb stretching-of-the-truth skills by nearly everyone encountered from the mail rider who was swallowed by a crocodile to our heroine, Rosamond, who can't tell a truth to save her life.<br />The story takes place along the Natchez Trace in Mississippi with &quot;Red Indians&quot;, robbers and a few famous American tall tale characters filling up the bad guy roster--with the hero, Jamie, switching sides regularly. Rosamond's father Clement Musgrove is a wealthy planter who meets Jamie at an inn and unwittingly brings his disruptive presence into Musgrove family.<br />Many deaths, lies, misunderstandings and berry stains later, Rosamond and Jamie do live happily ever after. . . and Rosamond even starts telling the truth. . . well mostly the truth, &quot;it was all true but the blue canopy&quot;.<br />This fanciful tale is a well-executed, superbly written, pleasant read and it's only afterwards that one realizes that Welty added a bit of acid to this pleasurable brew.	2004-05-16

It's author, Nafisi, has a great deal of respect and admiration for the works of Nabokov. Her enthusiasm made me feel that I must be missing out on something good, and I decided to cure that posthaste. Lolita, being his best-known, seemed the logical starting point.<br />From the first paragraph I was smitten with Nabokov. He writes seamlessly, brilliantly, seductively. The depth of my admiration of Nabokov's literary skills continue to grow as I continued to read. This despite, or perhaps actually because of, the subject matter.<br />I'll take a small aside here to say that I do not feel that novels should be held morally responsible. I read death and violence and many of the other Seven Deadly Sins as much as anyone else--after all, I love a good mystery. Notwithstanding that view, I was still uncomfortable with Humburt's flagrant disregard of what is to me an unquestionable wrong--the violation of a child.<br />As I said, I love a good mystery, and yet I don't like to read from the point of view of the villain himself. I find it unsettling. I felt the same way being inside the mind of Humbert: disturbed, disgusted, perhaps even tainted. Such strong emotions conjured up solely by the power of Nabokov's persuasive writing. What higher compliment can I pay him?<br />So troubled was I by Humbert's treatment of Lolita, by the sway he held over me the reader, that I stopped half-way through the novel, saying I just couldn't finish it. But I had to. Despite my revulsion of Humbert, I HAD to continue reading. Nabokov had me so firmly in his grip that I was genuinely concerned for Lolita. I had to know what happened to this child robbed of her childhood. I had to know if she, who Humbert so causally dismissed as seducer instead of seduced, would be free of his tyranny. I had to know if Lolita, only seen through Humbert's eyes, would find a voice of her own.<br />I can't say that I \\"liked\\" this book--how could I enjoy reading about such merciless victimization?--but I can certainly say that Nabokov has won another fan.voice of her own.<br />I can't say that I \\"liked\\" this book--how could I enjoy reading about such merciless victimization?--but I can certainly say that Nabokov has won another fan.	2004-05-07

Nafisi has written not an autobiography, but a story of her love affair with certain books and authors. She divides her life into four important phases, and the four books or authors that influenced her during that time in her life. It is a mix of personal memories, important moments in Iranian history, what she was reading at the time and how it colored her impressions.<br />She begins with what would be the next-to-the-last sequentially, the start of her home class and the reading of Lolita. That Nafisi is an excellent literature professor shines through from the beginning. She doesn't merely mention the books, she discusses them, as though with a class, discussing plot, characters, details, meaning. I, who had never been interested in Lolita or Nabokov, became convinced of his worth solely due to her enthusiasm and passion for his works.<br />She follows with the Iranian revolution and the subsequent &quot;trial&quot; of Gatsby in her classroom. Henry James accompanies the times following the revolution, the war with Iraq, her feelings of uselessness and her return to teaching. She ends with Jane Austen, more about her home class, how she ended up in America and where all her &quot;girls&quot; are now.<br />Though this could have easily been a depressing book, about life in Iran, it is not. Instead, Nafisi has written about the beauty and hope of the novel, how it affected her and how she wanted it to affect her students.<br />Nafisi is a kindred spirit to all us ardent bibliophiles. She expresses in words the passion, exhilaration and transfiguration I often feel during and after reading a novel and has lit a fire in me to re-read several classics she mentioned. This is definitely a five star book!	2004-05-07

So when Sheila, his girlfriend*, an artist, and the mother of their new daughter, suggested that they move to a small Italian town, he refused. Italian town life was not what he had in mind. It wasn't until his favorite cafe announced their impending closing that he resigned his opposition, packed up his resistance and went reluctantly to Sutri. Thus begins his travelogue, the bizarre, funny and enjoyable Pasquale's Nose.<br />Once in Sutri, he was pleasantly surprised to find that his life could follow the same course, minus the hotel dwelling. He joined the older men in the cafes morning till evening, expecting to while away the time, and never expecting to become so involved in, and even influenced by, the town of Sutri.<br />Sometimes cynical, sometimes idealistic, Rips looks to find himself in Sutri. In a way, he did. Rips takes the charms and peculiarities of Sutri, breathes them in and makes them his own. He becomes involved--if not mired--in aspects of Sutri including generations-old arguments about the origin of Pontius Pilate, decades-old rivalries over the best beans, hushed-up secrets of porcupine eaters, and debates about everything from Etruscans to horse meat to reality.<br />Sheila and their daughter are only briefly mentioned, and exist as only shadowy figures. The reader will know Pasquale, the Guidi's and Vera--even the town square itself with the palazzo built with wine in the mortar-- far more intimately than they will Rips immediate family. I couldn't help but wonder if Rips might have found himself more easily had more time been spent with them than with the Sutrini, but. . . Well, I, too, fell under the Sutrini spell so I can't really blame him.<br />This is a amiable book, with no definite conclusion, no sense of an ending, just a suspension as if the town (and the reader with it) had gone to bed for the evening. Sutri will resume on the morrow, the book will continue, Rips will continue in this fairy tale/alternate universe/timeless place. It was with deep disappointment I noticed that at the time of publication, Rips was living in a hotel in New York City.<br />*On the book flaps, Shelia is referred to as his wife. There is no basis for that in the book or in the one line about the author. The cover also mentions that Rips &quot;quit his life as an appellate lawyer&quot; to go to Sutri. That's another bit that has only the jacket to back it.

Turn of the century Buffalo, the PanAmerican Exposition, a headmistress and the Niagara Falls electric company just didn't sound like my kind of book. But then, a good friend recommended it--she has read it twice--and I thought I'd give it a try 'cause we have similar reading tastes.<br />I read the first page, and my opinion began to change. I eagerly turned to the next page, and the next, and. . . I became obsessed with Lousia, and the world around her, with the events that began with her or ended with her or just involved her. All weekend I read until I couldn't focus, needing to read, to know, to be a part of her world. Toward the end of the book I was torn between hurrying through to see how it would end, and dallying, to make it last.<br />I don't know how to describe this book, how to sort it neatly into a genre. There is mystery and history, inspiration and romance, fact and fiction--it's all there. But more importantly, there is life, in the plot, the characters, the conflicts and the conclusions.	2004-04-21

The Slaying of the Shrew is another merry, lighthearted, devious mystery featuring Shakespeare and his friend Tuck Smythe--the second in the series--and the death of a shrew on her wedding day.<br />This shrew just happens to be the best friend of Elizabeth (the love of Tuck's life) and as their acting troupe, The Queen's Men, were supposed to perform at the wedding. . . Well, they find themselves immersed--yet again--in a mystery.<br />The dialog is snappy, peppered with Shakespeare-isms, making an enjoyable read. The plot borrows from Shakespeare's plays in a teasing way that makes it doubly fun for fans of the Bard. I found the mystery to be intriguing and well planned, and enjoyed it to the end.<br />Aficionados of Elizabethan England, or mysteries, or both will enjoy this one. I, myself, am looking forward to the next in the series, to see if Hawke continues his excellent, good-natured Bard barbs.	2004-04-21

These letters give a beautiful insight into the mind of the military hero. They show his deep love and respect for his wife, his country and his God.<br />There are glimpses into their everyday life, as he discusses gardening, tithes, and his consent for one of their slaves to marry. He referrs to Anna as his &quot;dove&quot; or &quot;beloved&quot; or &quot;esposa&quot; and makes it clear that he dearly loves her.<br />Very little is ever mentioned of the hardships of camplife or war. My guess is that he wished to shield her from that as much as possible. He continually encouraged her to put her faith in God for his protection and reminded her that his life was in God's hands.<br />His letters show him as a gentle, though strong and steadfast, man, with great respect for others trying hard to live the Christian life. If he treated the troops under his command with the same respect that he seemed to show in all the other aspects of his life, it is no wonder they cheered when they saw him.<br />Over all, this is a warm, uplifting read that gave me an even greater respect and admiration for Stonewall. It is a nice change to see the private life of a hero match his public life.	2004-04-21

I knew little of Japan before I read it, but Mineko filled in many gaps and clarified many misconceptions.<br />She was the most successful geisha (actually &quot;geiko&quot;) of her time--beautiful, graceful and determined. And yet, she grew tired of the life, and retired at the very early age of twenty-nine, ending the ancient Iwasaki line.<br />She begins her book with her early childhood and her reasons for becoming a geiko. She takes the reader through training and all it's rigours through to her enormous success. She alludes to her disillusionment with the geiko life, and to her attempts to reform the educational traditions, but does not specify any of these. I was disappointed in that, for, having watched her mature in this book, I would like to have known more about her reform attempts, to have seen her in that role.<br />Geisha, A Life is not the most well-written of books, which could be due to either author or translator. But then, that doesn't really matter. Let's face it. . . no one reads an autobiography for literary merit. Autobiographies are read in an attempt to KNOW the writer, and in that aspect, Mineko succeeded--I felt like I was ending a conversation with a good friend when I closed this book.	2004-04-21

He is determined to marry off this difficult daughter to his advantage. She is equally determined not to be married. What follows is a battle of wills as Birdy tries to convince her father, and herself, that she is right and does not need to submit to any plans he has for her.<br />Written in journal style, Catherine, Called Birdy presents medieval life in a tangible, and quite humorous, way that pre-teens/teenagers will be able to connect with and understand. They will also be able to relate to Birdy as she finds herself on the threshold of adulthood, at that difficult stage where duty and rebellion intermingle, emotions run high and life often seems confusing, if not downright tragic.<br />This is a highly enjoyable book, both for it's historical details and for it's message. Over the short course of a year, we follow Birdy as she changes, looses some of her childish prejudices and finds herself--and those reading are encouraged to be strong and independent, while still be loyal and loving to family. Parents might wish to read this first, to decide if the veiled references to sex are appropriate for their child. I give this Newbery Honor Book an 8.5 out of 10.	2004-04-21

But, on the other hand, history has shown that Elizabeth was not a woman to be stopped by mere conventions and potential danger. As we all know, &quot;well behaved women rarely make history&quot; and make history she did!<br />It was a lively mystery, well written and well described, with a solid plot. I felt a real affinity for this version of Elizabeth and for her loyal band of friends.

The book ends with the marriage of Henry to Jane Seymour, making \\"Mary, Bloody Mary\\" an inappropriate title as that nickname was not earned until many years later.<br />On the whole, it's an fine book to give to early teens who are starting to, or maybe need to be encouraged to, develop an interest in history, the role of women throughout history, and strong female historical figures.	2004-04-21

The Figgs are an odd family and Mona Lisa Figg regrets being one. They have their own special place to go after death (Capri), they are all talented in some bizarre way and they revel in their unordinariness. Mona's not sure she believes in Capri, can find no specific talent and just wants to be like everyone else.<br />The only Figg she cares for is her Uncle Florence. When he dies, she finds Capri for herself, wanting to stay with him. This journey, naturally, makes her a better person in the end, more understanding and loving of her family and herself, and grants her a peace she hadn't had before.<br />There are some extremely funny bits and lots of nearly psychedelic incidents. Though it is listed as a juvenile book, I feel that it should be slanted more towards the young adult category as some of it simply too complex for a juvenile book. Some of the word play, situations and themes would be--in my opinion--meaningless or confusion to anyone younger than the late teens. Having said that, I can not give it a blanket recommendation and would recommend that a parent read it first to see if the discussion of death and the afterlife would be appropriate for their child.	2004-03-12

In this novel, Unsworth retells Greek story/myth of Agamemnon, Iphigeneia and the wind at Aulis that just wouldn't stop so that the Greeks could sail to attack Troy and reclaim Helen and their honor.<br />He writes with a delicious, tongue-in-cheekiness, fleshing out the characters to real people with real, and sometimes annoying, personality traits. The great hero Odysseus is a cocky trouble maker with a penchant for hearing himself speak. Achilles is flamboyant and egotistical. Agamemnon is willing to do whatever it takes to stay in power. Short, unattractive Menelaus is convinced that only kidnapping could have pulled Helen from his side and, um, prowess.<br />The main theme of the story, though unspoken, is that of public relations--&quot;good press&quot; if you will. The will of the people was easily manipulated through the innuendo, stories and sometimes outright lies told by the Singer. As there was only one Singer in the camp, his good opinion--and his song--was bought by the highest bidder. What they heard the Singer tell was what became the truth. A jab at modern day press, perhaps?<br />The story is often told from the standpoint of outsiders. Calchas, an Asian priest who has found favor with Agamemnon tells a large part of the narrative, as does Iphigeneia's maid Sisipyla. This looking in from the outside gives a different slant to the story, showing some actions, events and gods as alien.<br />This alien-ness is balanced by the views of Odysseus (as in the above quotation) and other Greek characters, both major and minor, seeing their world as the only natural way. These two views combine with good solid writing to form a fascinating tale that is hard to put down, even though I knew how it was going to end.<br />Anyone who enjoys Greek myths and would be amused (as opposed to horrified) to hear famous Greek heroes talk in modern lingo about &quot;CV's&quot; and &quot;glad rags&quot; and &quot;blabbermouths&quot; will probably get a kick out of The Songs of the Kings. I found it a fun read and definitely recommend it, though I was disappointed that Unsworth choose to end it where he did--I felt it should have went on just a bit longer. Nevertheless, I rate it an 8 of 10.gs of the Kings.

Using the same methodology, he successfully pinpointed the author as Joe Klein--who denied it vehemently for some time before admitting his authorship.<br />In addition to these highly publicized cases, Foster writes about his un-used work on both Unabomber case and the Talking Points, his angering of some Thomas Poyner fans and the truth behind &quot;Twas the Night Before Christmas.&quot;<br />This was an entertaining and enlightening book that I highly recommend. It's certainly the only non-fiction book I've ever stayed up late to read! I give it a 9.5 out of 10.	2004-03-12

Quite by accident, they found a way into an overgrown, fenced in storage yard behind it that obviously wasn't being used by it's owner, the local curio shop. April and Melanie knew instantly that it would be the perfect place to play pretend and set about making it inhabitable. Doing so, they discover a somewhat beat-up, but still beautiful, bust of Nefertiti. Add that to their imagination and the Egypt Game was born.<br />With Melanie's baby brother as the Boy Pharaoh and themselves as priestess to both Isis and Set (they took turns being the bad priestess), they created elaborate ceremonies and scenarios. Much reading was done at the local library and as their Egyptian knowledge grew, their interest in the game stayed fast. Eventually there are six in the Egypt Game, using their imaginations and their research skills.<br />Things take an odd turn as the \\"unexplained\\" makes an appearance. The six \\"Egyptians\\" start to wonder if the game has gone too far, crossed a line that they didn't know could be crossed. I won't spoil it be explaining, but will say that all turns out as it should.<br />I found this a good book for children on several levels. One was the relationship of April to her mother and to her grandmother. April idolized her mom, who was trying to make it big in Hollywood. April was sent to her grandmother's to stay for a while, just until her mom sorted things out in Hollywood. Seeing April mature and soften under the love of her steadfast grandmother is a good image for anyone.<br />The other thing I particularly liked about the Egypt Game was the obvious--the encouragement of both imagination and research. So many kids today don't play pretend. There are too many other distractions with TV, Internet and game systems. This book showed the magic of using the imagination, and the importance of doing a bit of research to know the subject. I liked that aspect immensely.of research to know the subject.

Didius Falco series, Shadows in Bronze, finds Marcus taking a &quot;holiday&quot; to Pompeii and the surrounded areas in search of a murderer who is also in search of him. With typical Falco bad luck following him every step of the way, he feels his way through the investigation and bumbles his relationship with Helena. The funny part of it is, you can't help but root for him while in the same breath you curse his pride and downright blindness. Davis' trademark lively narrative, witty dialog, and historical details makes for another great Falco adventure through Ancient Rome.<br />I'm re-reading the M. Didius Falco books as my husband reads them for the first time, and he is just as fond of Falco as I am. I can't recommend this series enough to those who like comedy, mystery and history. Just be sure to start with the first one in the series, though. These are not books to get out of order.	2004-03-04

Symington &quot;Tuck&quot; Smythe leaves his home and heads to London to be a player. Along the way, he comes upon one Will Shakespeare, a poet, also heading to London to be a player and (hopeful) a successful play-writer. The two form a friendship and find themselves as ostlers in a theatre troupe.<br />Our protagonist, Tuck, gets involved in a mystery involving a lovely young woman, much above him on the status ladder. His best buddy, Will, tags along making witty quips and being almost more a of a nuisance than a help in the mystery solving department.<br />Hawke has made a very real Will Shakespeare, spouting soon to be Shakespeare-isms and acting as a word-sparring partner with Smythe. Will is just an ordinary man, with the barest hint of the Shakespeare that is to come. It is well-done and the mystery itself was well-written. I thoroughly enjoyed it and cared enough about Tuck and Will to want to read more of this series.	2004-03-04

Her son, King Richard (of Lionheart fame) is being held for ransom in a German dungeon. She's trying desperately to raise the ransom money while her other son, Prince John (you know, the &quot;phony king of England&quot;) is trying equally as hard to keep her from succeeding. He wants to be King, and is quite willing to pay the Germans more to keep good old Coeur d' Lion languishing.<br />When the ransom from Wales gets highjacked, the Queen calls for her trusted man, and the hero of our story, Justin de Quincy. She knows, thanks to two other novels, that Justin will follow her desire to keep John's name out of any scandal while finding out just what IS going on.<br />With Dragon's Lair, Sharon Kay Penman spins another great medieval tale full of the flavor and danger those times possessed. Justin de Quincy has become one of my favorite problem solvers and I'm looking forward to the next problem that comes his way--though there's no date set for it as yet--with hopes that more of his past will come to light (as much for his benefit as mine) and with great curiosity as to what will happen to the two women in his life, Claudine and Molly.	2004-03-04

Interwoven with these tapestries emerges the stories of several people, all involved in some way with the story of the Lady and the Unicorn and the tapestries that depict it.<br />The novel is both well-written and well-told, using the first person narration, while changing narrators back and forth with each chapter.  This could have been a clunky method, but Chevalier has made each transition seamless and easy to follow.<br />Though I won't say this is my favorite Chevalier novel (Girl with a Pearl Earring holds that place) it is a wonderful novel, both in plot and writing.  Chevalier continues to write with an easy, reader-friendly style, though I can see subtle changes that speak of a maturing writer.  I highly recommend The Lady and the Unicorn, as well as other three novels.	2004-02-04

It is written in the first person, as Christopher begins writing a book as a school project. He is at first investigating the death of a neighborhood dog, but the book, and his life, takes a turn he never expected as he comes to learn more about his parents, family dynamics, humans in general, and what he, himself, is capable of achieving.<br />I had a special interest in reading this book, as I work with autistic pre-schoolers. It gives a wonderful insight into the mind of the autistic, explaining behaviors that may seem irrational on the surface, but that really serve a purpose for the survival of the child.<br />Oddly enough, the strength of this book (Christopher's narration) was also the book's weakness. It is very rare that anyone with Christopher's degree of autism would be able to explain his actions, thoughts, emotions. It was wonderful reading what was going on in Christopher's mind, but at the same time, I knew that it was so improbable that anyone like him would have been able to be so eloquent.<br />None the less, this is a funny, sad, unforgettable novel that I highly recommend.	2003-12-23

The Basic Eight takes a morbid theme--high school student bruatally murdered by heart broken peer--and turns it into one of the funniest black comidies I've ever read.<br />Flannery speaks to us through her journals and the little inserts she adds as she's editing them, and tells us how it really happened. Things that have no buisness being funny had me rolling on the floor. The dark humor that he uses in his children's books was out in full force in this, his first novel. If black comedy offends you, well, you'll be offended so stay away, otherwise, read it and find yourself laughing even though you're not really sure why.<br />I'm going to have to read it again, as it had a bit of a &quot;shocker&quot; in it towards the end.

The plot was transparent and had all the complexity of a Barbara Cartland novel. I checked out two others by her at the same time I got this one, but they've gone back unread. I love Austen's characters, and love to speculate on what might have happened to them after the end of the novels.

Not wishing to be separated, they flee to Venice, the fairyland of their mother's stories. They are soon befriended by a group of children--Hornet, Mosca, Riccio and Scipio, the Thief Lord. The Thief Lord robs from wealthy homes and passes the goods to the other children who fence them to provide food and other necessities.<br />At first, the book, though delightful, is rather predictable. Predictable in that I could tell what the \\"surprise\\" would be, though I wasn't sure how it would all tie together. Graceful writing and endearing characters kept me negligent of the fact that I \\"knew\\" how it would end.<br />However, about a third through the book, that surprise came and went and there were still a couple hundred pages left to go. From that point, the book begins a strangely magical journey that left me nearly breathless as the loose ends tied themselves into knots beyond my imagination. Sure, everything came together for the traditional happy ending, but. . . The getting there was the fun part.<br />The Thief Lord gets a 5 out of 5 for some of the best children's literature I've read for some time.	2003-12-09

Rose is touted as a mystery, but deals less with the mystery in question than it does with the protagonist's attempts to deal with the past.<br />Justine is a journalist who has been retained to write a article on the dynamic composer and conductor Sophie DeLyon. Sophie turns up missing, hence the mystery, and bits and pieces of her life find their way to Justine, fitting together in potential scandal, family controversy and the story that would make Justine's career.<br />The mystery, though, is on the back burner of the story (so to speak), as the overwhelming grief from the death of her mother, the estrangement from her sister and father, and an old lover press on Justine's mind and fight for the center stage.<br />Her memories of her mother are wrapped around smells and tastes from cooking with her, and come back unbidden with the crunch of an apple or the aroma of chocolate. Her father, also a chef, is unwillingly conjured up with herbs and spices. Her former lover, a cellist, haunts her memory through music.<br />The mystery of Sophie's disappearance was unexceptional, and is merely the canvas for Justine's attempts to come to grips with the past and move forward into the future. The strength of the book lies in the food and music imagery as Justine works through her memories to find some sort of peace with the past.	2003-12-09

Not only does Thursday have her more normal difficulties--vampires, time interruptions, dodo care, and the aftermath of changing the ending to Jane Eyre--but now she's apprenticed to Miss Havisham in the Jurisfiction department. She's having to learn book jumping for a reason that I won't divulge, but I will say it has to do with Jack Schitt and is extremely important. Add book jumping apprenticeship to talk show appearances, entropy and an abnormal amount of coincidences, a new Shakespeare discovery, unhappy Neanderthals and her day job at SpecOps.<br />Fforde reminds me of literary minded Douglas Adams--he can throw so many different, bizarre, amusing situations into a pot, give it a good stir and ladle out a hilarious novel that doesn't stop. (I can't wait to see how he handles the next Next novel. I hope he can keep up the pace!)<br />If you like literary jokes, lots of silly puns, impossible realities and alternate universes, all in a plot that Monty Python would be proud of, start with The Eyre Affair and then grab this one.

The plot took odd tangents that just didn't seem to fit. But, to Maguire's credit, he tied them all up nicely, but it was still just an odd book. I didn't really like it, but I couldn't stop reading it.<br />It starts out that our heroine, Winnie, is an author and is trying to write a new book. She's headed over to London to stay in her cousin's flat which is their family home. Seems that their ancestor had a haunted night around Christmas and told young Dickens about it and he later immortalized (and ficticionalized) the event into Scrooge and the Christmas hauntings. No problem there, I can follow that.<br />Then, her cousin isn't there but some work is being done at the flat and the workman are spooked because they think there's a ghost. Ghostly things happen, and yeah, there seems to be a ghost. I'm cool there too. Cool and excited.<br />Then things get odd. Winnie's book is being written in another font through out the chapters (which in itself was a bit confusing) about some chick named Wendy who's fascinated with Jack the Ripper. Winnie, as Wendy, decides this ghost must be Ripper's ghost or the ghost of one of his victims. Why? I have no idea! Then she decides it can't be, Winnie decides that is, because a piece of cloth that is found in the space that ghost comes from proves to be older'n that (according to some professional cloth time-teller lady) and a medium tells Winnie that it was a woman's cloth.<br />At this point, I'm rather curious as to where this is all going. What does that 17th century lady have to do with the whole Scrooge thing? Then, due to a lot of twists and turns that would spoil it to tell you, if I haven't spoiled it already, we discover that the ghost is, in fact, a French woman. Winnie gets possessed, then unpossessed and then goes home.<br />Sound like I am unclear? Well, it's because I am! Like I said, I didn't really like it, but I couldn't stop reading and some how or the other it all tied in, I think, but I still came away unsatisfied. Partly because, it was sold on the strength that there was more Scrooge elements to it, than there was.<br />I really liked his Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister : A Novel, it's a good read.

To me it's the best Jane Austen continuation/imitation that I have read so far.  And, being a Jane Austen-ophile, I've read a lot of them!  This one has the humor, character depth and interesting plot, not to mention slow, rambling narration style, of Miss Austen herself.<br />Ms. Bonavia-Hunt set the Austen style on the first page:<br />&quot;Who could have foretold that Dr. Robinson, who had done nothing of note in all his lifetime should, by the common and natural act of dying, set in motion a train of events so strange, so startling, so far removed from probability, as to emulate the riotous fancies of a disordered mind?&quot;<br />It takes place, as you might have guessed, at Pemberly three or four years after Darcy and Elizabeth wed.  Lady Catherine makes an appearance, as does Mr. Bennet, and the conversations of both could have been lifted from Pride and Prejudice.  Mr. Collins joins us by letter, sounding just as pompous and ridiculous as ever.  Elizabeth and Darcy keep that same sparring attraction that they developed in Pride and Prejudice.<br />Only Kitty has changed, and at first I found it a striking, drastic change.  But after thinking about it, several years away from the terrible influence of Lydia (who is never even alluded to!) could easily make a major difference in Kitty's life.<br />The new characters in Pemberly Shades have all the flavor of Austen originals.  The Miss Robinson's remind me of all of Austen's gossipy old maids, Mr. Acworth is a cross between Wickham and Willoughby and Major Wakeford is an unluckier Colonel Brandon.<br />If you love Austen and the Austen style, then I highly recommend this novel!  Run down to your local library or used bookstores and see if you can come up with a copy of it.  You'll thank me later.	2003-09-19

This novel is a believable take on the Cinderella story, complete with step-family, ashes and a prince.  Maguire sets the story with 17th century Holland as the backdrop.  Dutch painting, tulip speculation, superstition and 17th century society/manners/customs feature largely in the plot.<br />The main character is actually Iris, one of the step-sisters, with the Cinderella figure, Clara, as a supporting role.  The characters of Iris, Ruth, Clara and the step-mother were complex, realistic and very individual.  The complexity of Ruth's character was beautiful and sad, and I cared a great deal for her.<br />The end of the story, with ball and prince, wasn't quite as good as the rest of the story--in fact, the conclusion wasn't completely satisfying to me for some reason.  He tied up the loose ends too neatly, I think.  But then, the fairy tale element had to be present in some aspect other than just the superstitions of the day, so I suppose the &quot;happy ending&quot; can be justified.<br />On the whole, I enjoyed it tremendously.  It was well written, blending history and fiction and a bit of fantasy into an deep, compelling story.  I highly recommend it and will be reading the rest of his novels as soon as I can!	2003-09-17

I finished it this afternoon.<br />In her very kind e-mail, Ms. Chevalier warned me to &quot;keep in mind that it was my first novel and I had a lot to learn about novel-writing!&quot;  Would that my first novel could be of this quality!<br />In it, she introduces readers to those same facets that are found in her other two books:  disquieting themes beautifully and truthfully dealt with, complex protagonists dealing with situations like real live women and a story line so haunting that it lives on after the book is finished.<br />I have no intention of attempting to tell any about the plot, except that it is intricate and still believable, with surreal aspects involving linked past and future.  You'll just need to read it for yourself!<br />I highly recommend all three of Tracy Chevalier's publishied novels.

US	36628753	R2MREY72ZTTJ2S	0452280907	862818905	Fortune Is a River: Leonardo da Vinci Niccolo Machiavelli's Magnificent Dream Change Course Florenti	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Different View	This book offers a totally different historical view of Machiavelli and Da Vinci.  During the reading of this, they became very real, very human, to me.<br />Masters writes rather well, though he can't seem to make up his mind if he wants to call them by their surnames or their first names.  The switching back and forth becomes distracting at times.<br />It was fascinating to read about two such powerful, influential figures working on such a doomed project.  I recommend this book to anyone interested in Da Vinci or Machiavelli, or in the history of Florence.	2003-08-27

It did not live up to my expectations AT ALL.<br />I found out by reading the interview at the end of the book that the chapters were actually short stories that had been published at different times. That explained why they did NOT seem to flow well at all.<br />She wanted to keep the reader in suspense as to whether or not it was a Vermeer. The first chapter was the most recent and it worked back to when the painting was painted, but. . . That didn't flow well either. It seemed jerky and confusing, having the backward chronology, plus the last chapter wasn't actually the &quot;last&quot; if the chronology was being followed fully.<br />The idea for the story line was good, showing the power of art and following a painting from conception to now, but that was overshadowed by the unexceptional writing. There was, for me, only one memorable character and I've already forgotten most of the plot. I really think this book could have been so much better.<br />If you want to read a book about a Vermeer painting, skip this one and read Girl with a Pearl Earring by Tracy Chevalier. I can't recommend that one enough--it's been well over a year since I read it and the plot is still as fresh in my mind as Girl in Hyacinth Blue should be.	2003-08-27

Don't approach it thinking it is a book to be read quickly. . . I feel as though I were sitting in lectures, and I have to read it slowly, to be sure I'm getting all that Lewis is trying to say.  If you have an interest in etemology, you'll enjoy this book.  Read it in small bits, digest them over a day or two and then read some more!	2003-08-27
US	36628753	R3V35U0XSQM8UG	0385504209	315416156	The Da Vinci Code	Books	5	2	4	N	N	Excellent Suspense	I wouldn't give this book a blanket recommendation, because some of the theology/history discussions and elements present might be a bit too controversial for some. But for those of us who like to question even our most firmly held beliefs, this book revisits some interesting themes and gives room for some deep thought.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed it myself. It had a good mix of suspense and history and art and theology. Kept me strung along til the end, too, with a complex, twisty plot and characters that I cared about.<br />However, I did feel a little let down with the ending, just seemed like he had to try to hard to end it. Too much happened too quickly in the last five-ten pages.<br />None the less, I plan to read some more of Dan Brown's books--and some of those listed in his bibliography too!	2003-08-27

I highly recommend it to fellow logophiles, as it had interesting, witty and subtly humorous word usage.<br />It's about a small nation that (for reasons better explained by the book) loses the use of certain letters of the alphabet, one at a time. As the letters become unavailable in the story, they disappear in the writing as well.<br />It did get a little tough to read for the last few pages, when the letters were very scarce and the words spelled phonetically, but it was well worth finishing.	2003-08-27

It follows a family through decades, showing the changes in them and the changes in the world around them.  That stream-of-consciousness style that she is so famous for runs smoothly in The Years, and  just flows over the reader.  It was hard for me to tear myself away from this book. . . I had to simply shut the book, often in mid-sentance, to make myself stop reading.  This comes highly recommended.	2003-08-27

The plot is detailed and realistic and the characters equally so.  Lord Peter is at his most charming and observant.<br />The book centers around a church and it's bell ringers.  The chapters begin with quotes about bell ringing, which give it a wonderful flavor.<br />If you only read one Lord Peter novel, make it this one!	2003-08-27

It is not, however, suitable for young teens.  There are many themes that take maturity to understand and accept.  As a mother, I recommend it to adults and older teens who might not be surprised at the \\"ways of the world\\", but would not have my young daughter read it.	2003-08-25
