Brower.  His reflections in the interim led him \\"to feel that literary preoccupations need to be tempered with attention to the fundamental human concerns of Japanese court poetry.\\"  We are all the beneficiaries of this change in focus.<br /><br />Japanese Court Poetry is certainly a scholarly landmark, and it does not detract from its stature to claim in the same breath that this concise, well-organized Introduction to Japanese Court Poetry has no equal as an introductory survey.  One suspects that the clear, compact presentation may owe something to the fact that the book began as a series of lectures, where every word must be weighed.  Miner's opening sentence succinctly defines his use of the phrase \\"Japanese court poetry\\" to mean \\"a historical segment (ca. 550-1500) of what Japanese themselves call waka, or Japanese poetry -- serious verse written in their own language, as opposed to Chinese, from the earliest literate times.\\" (p.1)<br /><br />He later discusses what he sees as a general contrast between the assumptions underlying Japanese poetry and Western literature. \\"Their common elements aside, Western literature by comparison reveals a faith in action, in ideas, and in moral responsibiity -- these are what matter.  Japanese literature emphasizes human feeling and reflection in participation with much that we think is opposed to man -- especially nature and the divine.  The contrast, if simplified more, is between Western faith in persuasive ideas and Japanese faith in cultivated feeling.  .  . Faith in human feeling -- belief in its integrity and truth -- is probably the most consistent feature of Japanese literature from earliest to contemporary times.\\" (p. 9)  Food for thought. . .and discussion.<br /><br />But Miner also explains the nuts and bolts: kokoro versus kotoba, the forms of poetry (tanka, choka, sedoka, renga, etc.), \\"pillow-words,\\" honkadori, the poetic diary, and so on. Chapters Three through Seven systematically survey the poetry of Hitomaro through that of major poets to 1500.  Chapter Eight recaps Major Themes, followed by a Glossary, a Finding List for Poems, and an Index.  A nice tight little package of fewer than 200 pages.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book both for the general reader and for the student of Japanese literature.

This is the first book I have ever reviewed without actually haven't seen it, but I am sure that Amazon and  readers will bear with me.  As I write this, I have on my desk a copy of a book entitled _The Manyoshu: One Thousand Poems Selected and Translated from the Japanese_ .  .  .  .  .  (Tokyo: Published for the Nippon Gakujutsu Shinkokai by the Iwanami Shoten, 1940).  It has lxxx ( = 80) pages of introduction, 502 pages of text, and 5 unnumbered pages of maps.  Donald Keene's Seeds in the Heart, p. 179, refers to the following reprint:  \\"Nippon Gakujutsu Shinkokai. Manyoshu.  New York: Columbia University Press, 1965.\\"  There is surely good reason to conclude that all three books are essentially the same.<br /><br />This pioneer translation has a fine reputation and I am pleased to see that it is again available in print, and at a very reasonable price.  The new Dover edition is listed as being 464 pages long.  This is somewhat shorter than my version, but it is reasonable that some of the original material may have been dropped or reduced in size. Although this is the work of a \\"committee\\" -- and we all know the definition of a \\"camel\\" as \\"a horse designed by a committee,\\" this committee was fortunate to have had among its members the English poet Ralph Hodgson (1871-1962) who lectured in Japan (1924-38; see Cambridge Biographical Encyclopedia), and is cited on p. viii of my edition for having \\"revised\\" the \\"tentative translations.\\"<br /><br />I highly recommend this reprint and I commend Dover for making it available again.	2005-07-02

Both authors were disciples of Professor Jinichi Konishi, to whom the book is dedicated, and whose collaborative article on \\"Association and Progression: Principles of Integration in Anthologies and Sequences of Japanese Court Poetry, A.D. 900-1350\\" (Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies 21, [1958]) provided a major tool for their research.<br /><br />The two scholars set the agenda for the next generation of students, even to such details as the standard format for English translations of Japanese poetry. The 5-7-5-7-7 syllable units of the 31-syllable tanka, for example, were represented in English by five lines, with the shorter first and third lines indented - such as we find throughout Japanese Court Poetry.  The pattern is not universally accepted today, but it is as close to being standard as we are ever likely to get.<br /><br />A concise summary of the contents JCP may be of some use to the curious.<br /><br />PART ONE.

The complete Konjaku Monogatari is indeed a \\"huge multi-volume text,\\" as the last reviewer states; but the selection is certainly NOT \\"rather unorthodox.\\"  Professor Ury based her translations on the standard 5-volume text of the Nihon Koten Bungaku Taikei (NKBT) series, and her selections are carefully proportionate to the four main divisions into which the thirty-one \\"chapters\\" of stories are classified: \\"Tales of India,\\" \\"Tales of China,\\"\\"Tales of Buddhism in Japan,\\" and \\"Secular Tales of Japan.\\" It should be noted that the famous \\"Tale of Genji\\" in the same series also occupies 5 volumes.  (A quick check by ruler shows the Konjaku to be the larger of the two!)<br /><br />In her 5 + 25 page introduction Ury provides the reader with a concise but very detailed and well-informed analysis of the setsuwa genre, as well as the contents, sources, religious beliefs, and a select bibliography of important Western and Japanese works on the Konjaku.  It could not have been better written.  Ury's Tales has been the standard introduction in English to the Konjaku since it was first published in 1979, and will probably remain so for the foreseeable future.<br /><br />[It seems very likely, based on the following note which came to my attention, that Yoshiko Kurata Dykstra, another prominent scholar of setsuwa, may already have published a COMPLETE translation of the Konjaku:<br /><br />--- The Konjaku Tales: from a Medieval Japanese Collection. 5 vols.

Seeds in the Heart, the last volume to be published, covers the very earliest period -- from the Record of Ancient Matters (712) to the \\"Late Sixteenth Century,\\" spanning some 9 centuries.  That leaves 3 volumes for the next four centuries, an indication of the author's personal leanings.<br /><br />Of course, we all have our own preferences.  Since I happen to be interested in Tale Literature (setsuwa), I feel that out of the book's 1265 pages devoted to the early period, setsuwa might have been given a bit more space than the 41 pages between p. 568 and p. 609 (see below).

Again, it is probably well to point out that Sansom's 3-vol. narrative history of Japan is sometimes confused with several of his other works, and that, for all practical purposes, these three constitute the standard narrative history of Japan of our time. . . Of course, these \\"other works\\" are of the same high caliber and well worth our attention: Japan: A Short Cultural History (1931; Revised Edition, 1943); and especially, The Western World and Japan: A Study in the Interaction of European and Asiatic Cultures (1965; 504, xi pp). The author is identified in both books as \\"G.B. Sansom.\\" [Not a very exciting distinction, to be sure, but online computers sometimes get confused.]<br /><br />George Sansom (1883-1965) is variously identified on Amazon.com and elsewhere as George Sansom, G. Sansom, George Bailey Sansom, G. B. Sansom, George B. Sansom, and Sir George Sansom (yes, he was knighted in 1935 and again in 1947).  The 3-vol. set is signed \\"George Sansom\\".<br /><br />This third volume of the series stops at 1867. Sansom's stated reason for not continuing his history beyond this year is that he had lived too close to events of the Meiji Restoration (1868) for him to develop a perspective that only distance could supply.  For readers interested in later events, The Making of Modern Japan (2000; 2002), by Marius B. Jansen, another outstanding scholar of Japanese history, would be a good choice.  Since this history begins at 1600, there are overlapping accounts of the Edo period, but from two quite different perspectives.<br /><br />In short, this set is a good buy and is likely to remain the standard narrative history of Japan for the foreseeable future.	2005-06-05

Sansom\\") is not part of this classic trio.<br /><br />Although the period in Japan from 1334 to 1615 is noted for its endless civil wars, Sansom devotes considerable time and enthusiasm describing cultural developments and the country's initial contacts with the West -- a theme which he develops at length in \\"The Western World and Japan: A Study in the Interaction of European and Asiatic Cultures\\" (1965; 504, xi pp.), a work which cannot be too highly recommended! (Again, the author is indicated as \\"G.B. Sansom\\").<br /><br />In short, this is the standard narrative history of Japan for our time.

Still, readers may wonder why I give this book a 5-star rating. Although its explanations can be very clear, they can also be very dense; and no pictures - what would Alice think of that?<br /><br />Conze had a cranky disposition, often reflected in his writing.  Sometimes it seems that he deliberately chooses the abrasive word -- \\"trance\\" for samadhi (J., sanmai, jo), or \\"self-extinction\\" for anatman (J., muga) -- when a more palatable alternative would suffice. In today's sound-bite world the appearance of such words only confirm the misapprehension of Buddhism as some kind of nihilistic \\"mysticism\\" which denies \\"the individual.\\"<br /><br />I stumbled on this book a half-century ago and pencilled comments throughout my copy testify to the impact it made on me. (Fortunately, this was before the advent of the awful-yellow-ink-felt-pen, so the pencilling can easily be removed.)  In particular, it introduced me to the concept of the Mahayana Bodhisattva as a being defined by the CONTRADICTORY virtues of wisdom and compassion, and then to the prevalent use of METAPHOR in Buddhist religious language, which led to T.R.V. Murti's Central Philosophy of Buddhism, the Chinese \\"Ten Oxherding Pictures,\\" and The Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch [of Ch'an, Zen], Hui Neng (Eno, 638-713)]. \\".  .  . Since Buddha is made by your own nature, do not look for him outside your own body.  If you are deluded in your own nature, Buddha is then a sentient being; if you are awakened in your own nature, sentient beings are then Buddhas.  Compassion is Avalokitesvara [Kannon]; joyfully giving is Mahasthamaprapta [Seishi]. . . \\".  Yampolsky, p. 158. It all fits together.<br /><br />Conze: \\"(The Diamond Sutra states:)  \\"Here. O Subhuti, a Bodhisattva should think thus : \\"As many beings as there are in the universe of beings. . .as far as any conceivable universe of beings is conceived; all these should be led by me into Nirvana, into that realm of Nirvana which leaves nothing behind.  And yet, although innumerable beings have thus been led to Nirvana, no being at all has been led to Nirvana.  And why?  If in a Bodhisattva the perception of a `being' should take place, he would not be called an `enlightenment being' (=bodhi sattva).\\"<br /><br />\\"A Bodhisattva is a being compounded of the two contradictory forces of wisdom and compassion.  In his wisdom, he sees no persons; in his compassion he is resolved to save them.  His ability to combine these contradictory attitudes is the source of his greatness, and his ability to save himself and others.\\" (p. 130)<br /><br />The Buddhism of Faith conceived of Bodhisattvas, embodiments of the virtues of windom and compassion, as concrete individuals, and furnished them with names, legends, and a definite tangible individuality.  \\"Akshobhya and Amitabha [Amida], Avalokitesvara (Kuan-yin, Kannon] and Manjusri [Monju], all the celestial Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of this school are, however, obviously productions of the mind, and without historical or factual basis.  It is not easy to understand that the Mahayanists could admit this, as they did, and yet deny that these new saviours were mere creatures, nay figments, of the imagination, subjective and arbitrary inventions.  It is impossible to explain their attitude by the absence of an historical sense generally found among Hindus, since we know that the Indian Buddhists of the Hinayana used to argue that they could not believe in the celestial Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of the Mahayana because there was no evidence of their actual existence.<br /><br />\\". . . in religion, one type of mind requires an actual historical fact to base its belief on, while another regards the productions of the creative mythological imagination as in no way inferior to the products of human history. . . The mythological school regards the mythological concept as the essential thing.  Whether it is embodied, or not, in a person in history appears as a quite incidental and trivial detail.  The names of Amitabha, etc., may be invented, but the reality behind them, the Absolute, is there all the time.\\" (pp.150-151)<br /><br />\\". . . The Tantrists agree, however, with the metaphysical assumptions of the Prajnaparamita, according to which only the reality of emptiness is fully real, whereas any kind of multiplicity would be ultimately unreal, and the fictitious product of our diseased imagination.  The multiplicity of Gods would be really nothing but a fiction of the imagination, and not one of those deities would be really there.  Our free thinking modern mind would whole heartedly agree with that postulate.

Gijo).  [References to I-Tsing are occasionally confusing. Some writers prefer an alternate romanization possible in the Wade-Giles system for the second character - \\"ching\\"; hence, I-ching.  The Pinyin romanization is Yijing.  Not to worry -- bureaucrats and academics simply cannot restrain themselves from making the simplest matters as complicated as possible.]<br /><br />Both Fa-hsien and Hsuan-tsang were able to use an overland route to India, but by the time  I-tsing set out in 671 C.E. that option had been closed by the Arabs. But the detour did have a bonus: had I-Tsing been able to go directly to India, as he would have preferred, he would not have seen the Malay Archipelago and left us this unique record.  The Chinese text of I-Tsing's _Nan-hai-chi-kuei-nei-fa-ch'uan_ (J. Nankai kikinai hoden) is to be found in vol. 54 of the Taisho Issaikyo, T. 2125.<br /><br />The reader should not be put off by the fact that this is a reprint of a translation which first appeared in 1896.  The publisher was Oxford's Clarendon Press, and the translator was the famous Japanese scholar Junjiro Takakusu (1866-1945), whose _Essentials of Buddhist Philosophy_, frequently reprinted, is still a useful overview of Buddhist philosophy from the perspective of sectarian developments in Japan.  The text is packed with notes, and even a sprinkling of Chinese characters, as necessary.  The contents are detailed and as might be expected from the title.<br /><br />A recent translation by Li Rongxi from the Chinese original can also be found in the Numata Center series (93-1; 1994) as _A Record of the Inner Law Sent Home from the South Seas_, without notes but with short bibliography and index.

Well, not quite - but close.  _The _Essentials of Buddhist Philosophy_ by the eminent and prolific Japanese Buddhist scholar Junjiro Takakusu (1866-1945) essentially follows the skeletal design of an introductory overview of Japanese Buddhism by the Kegon monk Gyonen (1240-1321) called _The Essentials of the Eight Schools_ (Hasshu koyo) composed in 1268.  It was written for \\"beginners\\" (shogakusha) and was widely circulated  and used as a basic text in Japan until the Meiji Restoration (1868) - six centuries!<br /><br />Takakusu's _Essentials_, like Gyonen's, begin with two short chapters (but rather dense for \\"beginners\\") on \\"Indian Background\\" and \\"Fundamental Principles of Buddhist Philosophy\\" from a Japanese Mahayanist perspective.  Then follow separate chapters on five of the six \\"Nara\\" schools --  Kusha, Jojitsu, Hosso, Sanron [i.e., Madhyamika], and Kegon [Avatamsaka].  The \\"New\\" Ritsu school is not examined until the end of the list.<br /><br />Predictably, the Tendai and Shingon schools established in the early 9th century are next in line, followed by Kamakura's Zen, Jodo, and Nichiren schools.  (Gyonen briefly notes the Zen and Jodo movements, and Nichiren not at all.  In 1268 the mix had not yet jelled.)  Students of Japanese religion might be interested to know that a complete translation of Gyonen's _Essentials_  by Leo M. Pruden appears in the Numata Center series (107-1; 1994) with a survey of woodblock editions, glossaries of technical terms and cited texts, and an index.  It is an interesting supplement to Takakusu's _Essentials_, but does not replace it. (Also see OKUBO Ryoshun, Shin hasshu koyo. Kyoto: Hozokan, 2001 for a modern adaptation by a variety of experts.)<br /><br />Takakusu's _Essentials_ provides a substantial index, kanji for many names and technical terms; and, perhaps as useful as anything else, (tentative) English equivalents.  Also charts, with English, Sanskrit, and kanji, of the 75 dharmas of the Kusha School, and the 100 dharmas of the Hosso school.  No, it does not take time to examine the socio-historical context underlying all of this, but it does provide a clean, detailed outline of facts for ready reference.<br /><br />A good buy!dharmas of the Hosso school.

(This 28-chapter version differs in organization and presentation from the 27-chapter Sanskrit text translated into English by H. Kern in 1884, and still available for sale; the two versions should not be confused.)<br /><br />Although Kumarajiva's Lotus Sutra has influenced all of Japanese Buddhism in one way or another, it is the basic scripture for the great medieval Tendai (C., T'ien T'ai) sect, as well as the later Nichiren sect and its offshoots, especially Soka Gakkai and Rissho Koseikai, all three of which emphasize recitation of the \\"Nam' myohorengekyo\\" formula.\\"  The Lotus is NOT included in the scriptural canon of Southern Buddhism (Theravada) in Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand, and other areas of SE Asia.<br /><br />The Lotus Sutra is basically a statement of philosophical principles and should not be approached as literary entertainment.  Its message has serious implications - today probably more so than any time in past history.  But the reading takes patience and serious, quiet rumination.  Its message is that all sentient beings have the potential for attaining Buddhahood, but conceptual illusion prevents them from realizing that this is their essential nature.  Out of compassion, the Buddha(s) employs many devices (Skillful Means/Expedients; hoben) accommodated to their specific needs, to assist them in seeing through this illusion. (The notion is expressed through most of the sutra's Seven Parables.)  Although provisional teachings are not only possible but necessary, there is, in fact, only One Vehicle, one ultimate, ineffable spiritual goal; and for this reason the Lotus is sometimes called the Sutra of the One Vehicle. It is important to note, however, that the term does not describe an EXCLUSIVE DOGMATIC FORMULATION that is taken to be correct while others are false.  The ultimate religious experience is beyond the reach of rational understanding, which is, at best, \\"a finger pointing at the moon\\".<br /><br />Although the Lotus Sutra might be viewed as the BEST possible expression of the Buddha's teaching, it is NOT THE ONE AND ONLY way to spiritual realization: other scriptures (and other words, rituals, myths, metaphors, etc.) can be embraced as expressing a more or less adequate means for attaining spiritual understanding - the specific words or symbols do no matter. The One Vehicle refers to a single experiential GOAL to be reached through a variety of conceptual formulations and exercises, but ultimately transcending the word-games of rationality. Note, however, that although the Lotus Sutra freely admits many routes to enlightenment (because of the varying needs of individuals), it does NOT claim that \\"one view is just as good as any another,\\" i.e., relativism.<br /><br />Although today the most popular translation of the (Chinese) Lotus Sutra may be Burton Watson's elegant rendition (1993) into English, some serious scholars still prefer this older version by Leon Hurvitz (1976); and even, occasionally, the Bunno Kato collection of three sutras (1975).

US	52904025	R1TFA62646GTM9	006057058X	745908638	The Perennial Philosophy	Books	5	21	25	N	Y	Pluralism NOT Relativism	I first stumbled on _The Perennial Philosophy_ decades ago as a teenager, and it provided a sense of direction which eventually led me out of the enchanted forest of religious absolutism -- not into \\"relativism\\", but into tolerant pluralism.<br /><br />The underlying design of how religious language works in the \\"perennial philosophy\\" is clear, plausible and logical -- but apparently incomprehensible to the strident fundamentalist, who prefers the use of political coercion to sober deliberation. . . The issues are really quite simple:<br /><br />1. The ultimate source/goal of virtually every religious system is considered by its devotees to be undefinable, beyond the grasp of human reasoning, ineffable, surpassing understanding. Humans call this Ultimate: Godhead (as distinct from \\"God\\"), Brahman (as distinct from \\"Brahma\\"), etc.<br /><br />2. Since this religious Ultimate cannot he rationally defined, described, analysed, or plotted by mathematical models, religious language usage differs from that of the physical sciences.  It employs verbal, visual, musical, metaphorical, mythological, and allegorical symbolism to SUGGEST that which humans may experience without being able to define:  \\"When I heard the Learn'd Astronomer, etc.\\" (Whitman). . . (Here is where we part company with the rigid rationalist for whom there is no reality apart from what can be measured or weighed.)<br /><br />3. Religious systems arise at different times and places with various mythologies adapted to local needs.  As long as these anthropomorhic creations lead the devotee to spiritual realization, they have value -- but not necessarily EQUAL value with every other mythology. Every individual understandably considers his own belief system as BETTER than those of others, and possibly the BEST of all; but this is radically different from claiming that his beliefs are the ONE AND ONLY POSSIBLE WAY to religious realization. BEST leaves open the possibility that other practices may be viable, though inferior; ONLY is binary -- you're either in or you're out, and that can make all the difference in the world. Consider the following:<br /><br />4. In 9th-century Buddhist Japan the Shingon monk Kukai wrote a treatise on \\"The Ten Stages of Religious Consciousness\\" in which he predictably placed his own Shingon Sect at the top of the list. A competitor, the Tendai monk Saicho had no problem with this but was annoyed that Kukai placed the practice of the Kegon sect on the 9th rung, just ahead of Tendai on the 8th. Note that both Kukai and Saicho clearly recognized that all three sects provided ways to achieve spiritual realization, although one might be considered a BETTER practice than another.  This is pluralism, NOT relativism (one thing being just as good as another). And neither claimed that his was the ONLY possible method.<br /><br />5. Almost 5 centures later in his _Sand and Pebbles(Shasekishu): The Tales of Muju Ichien, a Voice for Pluralism in Kamakura Japan_ says in his Preface: \\"There is not just one method for entering the Way, the causes and conditions for enlightenment being many.  Once a person understands their general significance, he will see that the purport of the various teachings does not vary.  And when he puts them into practice, he will find that the goal of the myriad religious exercises is the same.\\"  And where does Muju get this idea?  Basically from the Mahayana tradition, especially as expressed in _The Lotus Sutra_,q.v.  Once again, the alternative to religious absolutism is inclusive pluralism, not \\"relativism\\".<br /><br />In 1945 Aldous Huxley almost certainly never heard of these examples, but he was, and continues to be, a major force in introducing and defending religious pluralism in the West. _The Perennial Philosophy_ continues to inspire.viable, though inferior; ONLY is binary -- you're either in or you're out, and that can make all the difference in the world.

A condensation, rather then a continuation, of (1) and (2).<br /><br />The SECOND volume of the series, East Asia: The Modern Transformation, was designed as a continuation of  East Asia: The Great Tradition, but they have a chronological overlap of several centuries: the first volume traces TRADITIONAL China through the Ch'ing dynasty and Japan through the Tokugawa period, while the second volume sees the MODERNIZING phase as beginning with \\"The Coming of the Europeans\\" to East Asia as early as the 16th century.  This is a good strategy for presentation, but we should be careful not to read \\"modernizing\\" as being equivalent to \\"civilizing.\\"  The countries of China, Korea, Japan, and Southeast Asia had as much claim to being civilized as the intruding Westerners. . .  Readers interested in this period of cross-fertilization should also check out The Western World and Japan: A Study in the Interaction of European and Asiatic Cultures (1965) by the preeminent Western scholar of Japanese history, George Sansom (book signed as G.B. Sansom; 1883-1965), pp. xvi, 504, xi (index). Although the focus of the work is on Japan, Part One (pp. 1-164) discusses the larger context of  \\"Europe and Asia,\\" especially China.<br /><br />While all three books were originally designed with the classroom in mind, I am gradually of the opinion that they are more appropriate for an older class of readers who have had time to develop a taste for history.  During the second decade of our lives we tend to be too distracted by SAT scores, term papers, and hormones to see history as much more than the boring memorization of names-and-dates.  So when should we start learning about history?  Probably during our first decade as children, when we tend to be interested in just about everything.<br />Then, with a little luck, our interest may survive the turbulent second decade. . . .<br /><br />Be all that as it may,  East Asia: The Modern Transformation (xvi, 955 pp.-- a full 216 pages more than volume one), is also packed with monochrome illustrations, drawings, maps and charts. The text is divided into 10 chapters, including one each on \\"East and Southeast Asia in the Age of Imperialism,\\"  \\"Colonialism and Nationalism in the Peripheral Areas,\\" and \\"East Asia in the New International World.\\"  It also includes, as did volume one, a Pronunciation Guide of Chinese [Wade-Giles], Korean and Japanese. This is followed by 8 pages of Bibliography (omitted in East Asia: Tradition and Transformation, probably because of the rapidly expanding number of books and articles in recent decades), and a detailed index (pp. 899-955).<br /><br />Another great bargain!

But for how long?<br /><br />East Asia: The Great Tradition (xiii, 739 pp., including many clear monochrome illustrations and drawings) is an excellent narrative history from the beginnings of East Asia to the \\"Eve of Modernization\\" --somewhere between the middle and end of the 19th century. It consists of 14 Chapters, mainly devoted to China and Japan, but including one on \\"Traditional Korea.\\"<br /><br />It provides a Pronunciation Guide of Chinese, Korean and Japanese.  \\"The Romanization systems used in this book are those generally considered standard in the English-speaking world: Wade-Giles for Chinese (with the omission of a few diacritical marks); McCune-Reischauer for Korean; and Hepburn for Japanese\\" (p. 675). . .

While all four reviewers give Sansom's 3-vol. history high marks for readability and accuracy, several note that it is somewhat dated, and that the alternative Cambridge History of Japan is rather pricey for most students or casual readers -- $750 for all 6 volumes through Amazon, at the moment. This raises several issues which merit consideration.<br /><br />George Sansom is probably the last of the great solo historians of Japan, following James Murdoch (1903, 1910, 1926) and Frank Brinkley (1915). Today the mass of information is too great for any one individual to digest and integrate, and any book covering the entire history of Japan will inevitably be a collaboration.  Hence the 6-volume Cambridge History in which, for example, Volume 3 (\\"Medieval Japan,\\" i.e., the Kamakura and Muromachi periods) consists of an introduction followed by 13 articles by distinguished scholars. This makes the set somewhat bumpy to read when compared to a single, integrated narrative<br /><br />history; and it raises the question of whether one might be better off with a timeline and, say, the 2-volume Japan: An Illustrated Encyclopedia (Kodansha 1993), condensed from the 10-vol. original (1985) Encyclopedia of Japan, now offered on Amazon.com for an amazing $95!!!  Or something even less pricey but still adequate.  In any case, the day of the one-man band seems to be over: Gibbon was a very busy fellow indeed, and we are not likely to see a repeat performance any time soon.<br /><br />A few more items of interest.  Sansom is variously identified on Amazon.com and elsewhere as George Sansom, G. Sansom, George Bailey Sansom, G. B. Sansom, George B. Sansom, and Sir George Sansom (yes, he was knighted in 1935 and again in 1947).  He himself uses three of the above.  The 3-vol. set is signed \\"George Sansom,\\" but the earlier Japan: A Short Cultural History (1931; Revised Edition, 1943) has G.B. Sansom.<br /><br />Also, his third volume of the series stops at 1867. Sansom's stated reason for not continuing his history beyond this year is that he had lived too close to events of the Meiji Restoration (1868) for him to develop a perspective that only distance could supply.  For readers interested in later events, The Making of Modern Japan(2000; 2002), by Marius B. Jansen, another outstanding scholar of Japanese history, would be a good choice.  Since this history begins at 1600, there are<br /><br />overlapping accounts of the Edo period, but from two quite different perspectives.<br /><br />In short, this set is a good buy and is likely to remain a standard text for decades to come.ason for not continuing his history beyond this year is that he had lived too close to events of the Meiji Restoration (1868) for him to develop a perspective that only distance could supply.

Sansom (1883-1965), perhaps the last great comprehensive historian of Japan writing in English, his The Western World of Japan:  A Study in the Interaction of European and Asiatic Cultures is one of my all-time favorites.  Part of the reason is surely because I can think of no other work quite like it on the subject.  I cannot describe it any more eloquently or accurately than the flyleaf blurb of my 1965 Fifth Printing edition:<br /><br />.....This masterwork is not only an account of the cultural influence of the West upon Japan; it is also a study of the way in which cultures interact. It reveals the process by which the intrusive civilizations of the West, since even before the Christian era, have affected  the Asiatic peoples in general and the Japanese in particular, first only slightly and spasmodically, and then with increasing power.<br /><br />.....The first part of the book traces the early cultural relations between Europe and Asia. Against this historical background the second part shows how Japan reacted to Western influence from the  days of her first contact with Europeans down to the time of her entry into international life in the nineteenth century.<br /><br />.....Historians will recognize instantly in this method the challenge both to Japan's own mystical and myth-ridden historiography, and to the West's narrow and self-centered preconceptions, which have prevented its historians from seeing that the institutions finally adopted were, if Western in shape, thoroughly Japanese in color and substance.<br /><br />.....And philosophers will recognize instantly the challenge thrown at Toynbee and Spengler when the author offers evidence of the way in which a society can decay and renew itself without changing its essence. He questions whether any of the chief civilizations of Asia will, even if they voluntarily follow a Western economic pattern, submit to Western precept in political, social, or religious life.<br /><br />*** This is a great book by a great scholar and you will enjoy it.

Now, however,there is a new edition of Sources using the newer pinyin romanization system. Reischauer still uses the old Wade-Giles system. So I can't assign it any longer - I can't expect my students to have the two basic books in the course use different romanizations. Could not Houghton-Mifflin redo Reischauer using pinyin? It could be done with no effort by using a simple replace function on a computer.\\"<br /><br />I do hope that Houghton-Mifflin holds its ground and replaces nothing. The Chinese PRC decreed the Pinyin system in 1957, co-opted most Western academics (especially the younger generation) in the 70's, dealing a major blow to traditional, a-political scholarship.  Of course you \\"can't expect your students to have the two basic books in the course use different romanizations.\\"  That was the whole point -- force out the \\"old Wade-Giles system\\", and the scholarship that employs it.  Simple politics. . . and it works; evidently the price we pay for \\"progress\\" -- toward what?<br /><br />Yes, E.O.Reischauer (1910-1990) still used the \\"old\\" Wade-Giles system \\" - would not \\"traditional\\" be a more neutral adjective? -and he might well object to changing what he had written simply to conform to current political fashion. . .Actually,I suppose the coauthor, John K. Fairbank (1907-1991), is responsible for keeping Wade-Giles, since he was the China expert and Reischauer represented Japan.  I don't know anything about Fairbank's political leanings -- only that I was told that he could become furious when addressed as \\"Fairbanks,\\" which (he would impatiently explain) \\"is a town in Alaska!\\"	2005-05-08

All three have had their critics and all three have survived comfortably into the 21st century.<br /><br />But the Cultural History is not just curious relic.  It often describes, in clear and straightforward terms, items of cultural behavior which contemporary scholars are often tempted to dispute contentiously, present in technical jargon, or ignore completely. Take, for example, this introduction to the crucial distinction in Shinto between \\"ritual purity\\" and \\"moral guilt\\":<br /><br />.  .  .  .  .  .  .  . The outstanding feature of Shinto observances is the attention paid to ritual purity.  Things which are offensive to the gods were called by the early Japanese TSUMI, a word which is now rendered by dictionaries as \\"guilt\\" or \\"sin.\\"  Avoidance of these things was called IMI, a word meaning taboo.  The Imibe, as we have seen, were a class of professional \\"abstainers,\\" whose duty it was to keep free from pollution so that they might approach the gods without offence. Chief among the offences to be avoided was uncleanness.  It might arise in many ways, none of which in other religions would be moral guilt.  .  . (p. 32ff.)<br /><br />Those with a bigger appetite for historical detail might consider starting, or continuing, with Sansom's later 3-volume narrative history: A History of Japan to 1334 (1958), A History of Japan 1334-1615 (1961), and A History of Japan 1615-1867 (1963).  Sansom's stated reason for not continuing his history beyond 1867 is that he had lived too close to events of the Meiji Restoration (1868) for him to develop a perspective that only distance could supply.<br /><br />For readers interested in later events, The Making of Modern Japan (2000; 2002), by Marius B.

Because I am not convinced that Sansom's Historical Grammar is of no further interest or use to students of Japanese literature just because, like so many other classics, it has been tossed aside by later generations in their mad pursuit of cutting-edge modernity, the common feature of whose manifestations (such as the recent comparative literature critical jargon) would seem to be that they be presented as opaquely as possible.  Sansom's Grammar, by contrast, was written in clear, literate, unpretentious English which is still a pleasure to read.  Modern research has doubtless solved some earlier usage riddles, but have the advances been so great as to completely discredit Sansom's pioneer work?  Time will tell, but I doubt it. . .  Oxford Clarendon Press produced the first edition in 1928, with reprints in 1946 and 1960 lithographically \\"from corrected sheets of the first edition.\\"  The current 1995 Curzon reprint appears to have been reproduced directly from one of these.<br /><br />After an introductory  68-page historical overview of Japanese language usage, Sansom discusses the various parts of speech and their usages over time, chapter by chapter --  II. The Substantive, III. Predicative words, etc.  He avoids introducing the traditional labels for \\"bases\\" (mizenkei, renyokei, shushikei, etc.), but he does provide a table (p. 50) in which the structure is clearly present, although not in the traditional order, and he provides his own English equivalents for the Japanese distinctions.  Harold Henderson's Handbook of Japanese Grammar [Houghton Mifflin, 1943] retained many of the English equivalents while introducing the Japanese nomenclature and restoring the traditional order, which was then adopted by Ivan Morris's Dictionary of Selected Forms in Classical Japanese Literature (1966).  It should be noted that the traditional structures and distinctions for analyzing Japanese grammar are still employed in standard Japanese dictionaries and grammar books published today, and learning them first in an English context provides a convenient bridge both to dictionaries of contemporary usage (kokugo jiten) and classic usage (kogo jiten).  But the Henderson and Morris dictionaries are also things of the past.  I cannot imagine how this material is taught today, if at all.

(This 28-chapter version differs in organization and presentation from the 27-chapter Sanskrit text translated into English by H. Kern in 1884, and still available for sale; the two versions should not be confused.)<br /><br />Although Kumarajiva's Lotus Sutra has influenced all of Japanese Buddhism in one way or another, it is the basic scripture for the great medieval Tendai (C., T'ien T'ai) sect, as well as the later Nichiren sect and its offshoots, especially Soka Gakkai and Rissho Koseikai, all three of which emphasize recitation of the \\"Nam' myohorengekyo\\" formula.\\"  The Lotus is NOT included in the scriptural canon of Southern Buddhism (Theravada) in Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand, and other areas of SE Asia.<br /><br />The Lotus Sutra is basically a statement of philosophical principles and should not be approached as literary entertainment.  Its message has serious implications - today probably more so than any time in past history.  But the reading takes patience and serious, quiet rumination.  Its message is that all sentient beings have the potential for attaining Buddhahood, but conceptual illusion prevents them from realizing that this is their essential nature.  Out of compassion, the Buddha(s) employs many devices (Skillful Means/Expedients; hoben) accommodated to their specific needs, to assist them in seeing through this illusion. (The notion is expressed through most of the sutra's Seven Parables.)  Although provisional teachings are not only possible but necessary, there is, in fact, only One Vehicle, one ultimate, ineffable spiritual goal; and for this reason the Lotus is sometimes called the Sutra of the One Vehicle. It is important to note, however, that the term does not describe an EXCLUSIVE DOGMATIC FORMULATION that is taken to be correct while others are false.  The ultimate religious experience is beyond the reach of rational understanding, which is, at best, \\"a finger pointing at the moon\\".  Although the Lotus Sutra may be viewed as the BEST possible expression of the Buddha's teaching, it is NOT THE ONE AND ONLY way to spiritual realization: other scriptures (and other words, rituals, myths, metaphors, etc.) can be embraced as expressing a more or less adequate means for attaining spiritual understanding - the specific words or symbols do no matter. The One Vehicle refers to a single experiential GOAL to be reached through a variety of conceptual formulations and exercises, but ultimately transcending the word-games of rationality. Note, however, that although the Lotus Sutra freely admits many routes to enlightenment (because of the varying needs of individuals), it does NOT claim that \\"one view is just as good as any another,\\" i.e., relativism.<br /><br />Today the most popular translation of the (Chinese) Lotus Sutra is Burton Watson's elegant rendition (1993) into English, although some scholars still prefer the older version by Leon Hurvitz (1976), and even, occasionally, the Bunno Kato collection of three sutras (1975).  These and several other translations can almost all be found on Amazon.com, and the buyer should always be aware that popularity does not necessarily guarantee quality -- neither in books nor in ideas.

For this reader, however, the book raises the hope that it may actually be possible to arrive at some kind of genuine ecumenical accommodation between Roman Catholicism (or any form of Christianity, for that matter) and Judaism, and Islam -- yes, and maybe even those great historical systems of belief and practice such as Hinduism and Buddhism, about which Cardinal Ratzinger (a.k.a. Benedict XVI)is quoted as saying: \\"Objectively speaking, they are in a gravely deficient situation in comparison with those who, in the Church, have the fullness of the means of salvation.\\" (Dominus Jesus Declaration, 2000; cited in _Newsweek_, 5/2/2005, p. 46.)  Not a very promising start for genuine dialogue.  Professor Kung reminds us that John Paul II, ' the \\"great communicator\\" who with charm, sportsmanship, and symbolic gestures could present even the most conservative doctrine or practice as acceptable (p. 192),' was equally opposed to any genuine accommodation.  Such a distinguished Roman Catholic priest-scholar suggests some cause for hope for a change in Church policy; but I am not wildly optimistic.<br /><br />Genuine ecumenical accommodation requires all parties to a discussion to sit down quietly and conscientiously discuss the<br />issues at stake.  Kissing the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem or having tea with the Dalai Lama are merely photo ops.  The real issue is whether or not Christians (and Jews and Muslims) can discover theoretical grounds within their own belief-systems for<br />respecting diversity of belief outside their own traditions. It is acceptable, indeed natural, to believe that one's own belief is \\"superior\\" or \\"better\\" than those held by others. But when a believer insists that his/her beliefs are the ONE AND ONLY way<br />to spiritual awakening, he forfeits all possibility for dialogue. I think that most non-Christians, like myself, would much prefer that Christianity reinvigorate itself through genuine ecumenical dialogue than that it self-destruct by insisting on its uniqueness as the one-and-only True Faith. Catholic theologians like Kung may provide sensible inclusive solutions to endless confrontation.at Christianity reinvigorate itself through genuine ecumenical dialogue than that it self-destruct by insisting on its uniqueness as the one-and-only True Faith.

The winds of philosophical fashion are variable, and we may find that tomorrow this work might well be on the Best Seller list.  Who knows?<br /><br />Central Philosophy was first published in 1955 (revised in 1960), so this will be (in a couple of hours) its fiftieth anniversary.  I had the good fortune to know and to take several courses with Professor Murti while he was on teaching leave at the University of Chicago in the late 1950's. I recall one of his offhand remarks that \\"Buddhism was Hinduism for export\\" and I questioned him at the time as to whether he thought that one system was \\"true\\" (as opposed to the other), or at least \\"better\\" (in the sense of more rationally coherent).  His reply, as I recall, was that one system was based on \\"atman\\" (self) and the other on \\"anatman\\" (no-self); both rationalizations had their characteristic strengths and weaknesses, but, as an Indian raised in India, he happened to prefer the Vedanta (Hinduism). Had he been born elsewhere, he might just as likely have preferred Buddhism. . . That a committed Hindu could write such a sympathetic book on Buddhism still impresses me, living as I do in a society of believers one or another One-and-Only-True Faith.<br /><br />I suspect that Murti's attitude may also shed some light on the current ambivalence about his work.  The dangers of reifying the ineffable have always troubled Buddhists, but the issues can easily enough be resolved if we view all rational/mythological systems as \\"word games\\" (another of Murti's favorite phrases), some more plausible or interesting than others, but none as being \\"True\\" to the exclusion of all others.<br /><br />Murti also had the temerity to compare the Madhyamika with philosophers in the Western tradition -- Kant, Hegel, and Bradley -- and no good Eurocentric philosopher is going to sit still for this.  Well, maybe eventually, but not quite yet.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the paperback is still print, inexpensive, and well worth a second look.Well, maybe eventually, but not quite yet. <br />Meanwhile, the paperback is still print, inexpensive, and well worth a second look. <br />	2004-12-31

The Ocean Defined [by the Spaniards, English, Dutch, etc., of course]; Part 3. From Cook to Perry [need I say more]; and, finally, Modern Times [pp. 79-112, including much detail about WWII].<br />  On the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the author states:  &quot;. . .as is often the case in Japan, things were not as they seemed.  For instance, the idea that power was being restored to the emperor was simply humbug; the monarchy remained, as it always had been, purely ceremonial.  For another, the new government was searching for a consenses and soon found it; top priority,it announced, would go to strengthening the armed forces.  In a society that took great pride in its warrior caste, this was not a policy anyone could oppose. . .&quot;  And so on.<br />  If the reader is content to understand the history of Japan simply as a series of Mifune films, topped off by &quot;The Last Samurai&quot;, this may be the book for you.  Otherwise, you will recall that the monarchy was very much in control of the government at least from the days of Prince Shotoku (d. 622) until the Gempei War (1180-85). . . He/she will also recall that the samurai class lost its political and social position from the very beginning of the Meiji Restoration.  Was this a &quot;society that took great pride in its warrior caste,&quot; or was it a society that was &quot;opened&quot; in 1853 with Commodore Perry's guns trained on the capital, a society quite aware of how Europe (including England) and America were on a rampage to colonize the entire world, that it might bestow upon it the blessings of democracy and Christianity?  What would you do if you were a Japanese in 1868?<br />  On the issue of inaccuracy, let me cite at least one, including one of the author's remarks that some might mistakenly consider amusing:  &quot;The Japanese script, on the other hand, though it looks similar to Chinese, was, from the start, an instrument for writing Japanese.  There are several variants, which were combined with Chinese characters to produce the wildly complicated, often ambiguous hotch-potch that has proved so perfect a match for the Japanese psyche.&quot; (p. 23)<br />  Where does one begin to address such a confused -- and bigoted -- statement? The earliest extant document in Japanese, the Kojiki (ca. 712), for the most part used Chinese characters for their PHONETIC value to convey Japanese sounds. The Nihon shoki (720), on the other hand, was written by Japanese IN CHINESE.  Eventually, the Japanese developed two parallel syllabaries (kana) -- hiragana and katakana -- to complement the use of Chinese used SEMANTICALLY, for their meaning. . . The chart on p. 23 is also misleading.  The Korean column contains standard Chinese characters but should probably display the Hankul script developed by the Koreans; and the &quot;Japanese&quot; column is, at best, some example of specialized writing style that to most Japanese today would be simply unreadable.  Ask one.<br />  For a good book on the issues, see Peter T. Daniels and William Bright, &quot;The World's Writing Systems,&quot; New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996. 922 pages.ly consider amusing:  &quot;The Japanese script, on the other hand, though it looks similar to Chinese, was, from the start, an instrument for writing Japanese.

The 1937 (actually 1938) edition of the Hsiao Ching was considerably revised in 1948, and I studied it with Prof. Creel at U of Chicago. It uses the Wade-Giles system and consciously avoids contact with modern colloquial Chinese. Includes etymologies with bone and drum character drawings.  Vol. 2 continues with the Lun Yu (Analects), and vol. 3 with the Mencius. Not likely to appeal to the fashionable Pinyin crowd, but an antiquarian might well give it 5 stars.
