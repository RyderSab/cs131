Telling you much about his life might spoil the story for you, but suffice to say he's a very interesting character.<br /><br />I picked this book to read because I was looking for some good reading of ancient battles, and the book began with a bang in this regard. I settled in for a Roman-esq version of The Ten Thousand, with constant combat and hardships. The more I read, the more I realized that this book was less combat intensive, and more focused on the characters, which made it a much better read for me.<br /><br />Ford mentions in the postscript that there is a wealth of information avaliable on the life of Julian, and I think he was able to use that to his advantage. This book is very much focused on his and Caesarius' lives, and how the interact with one another. The main conflict in the book, aside from Julian against the world, is the old world (paganism) against the new world (christanity). The struggle is just covert enough to make up for the lack of legions marching into battle. Ford does an excellent job building up the characters to the inevitable conflict between the two worlds, and I have to say that I was surprised by how that conflict played out.<br /><br />The battles and the world were painted very well. In my opinion, Ford did a much better job in this book of putting the reader in the world than in The Ten Thousand.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.	2005-09-23

As the humans learn exactly what they are facing, they begin to plan for the inevitable invasion of earth. However, the Posleen don't adhere to schedules, so the fun begins a little early...<br /><br />I have to say here again, when reading this series, you have to remember what you are getting into. This is not cerebral stuff by a long shot, but it is fun.<br /><br />One thing that really annoyed me about the book was Oneal. Just something about the way Ringo paints him bugs me. Sure, he's a hero. I get that. But saying \\"Nyah, nyah, you can't hurt me!\\" in the middle of combat was a bit much to be expected to swallow. It was almost too much, even with an open mind.	2005-09-06

A Hymn Before Battle is the first book in the series, and was my first exposure to John Ringo.<br /><br />As has been noted by other reviewers, Ringo really seems to know the military intimately. Of course there is a healthy does of the sensational mixed in, but the tactics and jargon seem to make sense, at least as far as I know.<br /><br />The characters are sensational. At times it read more like a comic book rather than a novel, but I wasn't going into this looking for War and Peace, either. Colorful and bold would be a good way to describe them, but it adds something to the universe, I think.<br /><br />To me, most of the story seemed to flow naturally; as natural as having the human race pimped out to a bunch of pacifist aliens can seem. I found myself thinking that things were too far out of the realm of possibility when you read about politicians trying to make the best out what could be the end of the human race, or of people trying to make a buck and damn the consequences.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed in the ending. As I've said, I wasn't expecting too much, but things went a little beyond the fantastic. Since I hate spoilers, I won't say too much, but Ringo took the \\"one-man-army\\" concept to a whole new level. It read a little like a video game, and I'm sure some of the characters were glad they had god-mode on.<br /><br />Other than that, I found A Hymn Before Battle to be very enjoyable. I'm looking forward to the rest of the series. My only advice would be to not try to make too much sense out of the plot, and just enjoy the explosions.	2005-08-27

The events in the book occur before Insurrection, so you need not have read it before this, unless you just want to get a feel for the weapons and structure of the universe. I found my eyes glazing over during the ground combat moments, and of course the literal translation of the Scottish accent was death to me, but overall I enjoyed the book. I'm looking forward to In Death's Ground, as it seems to have a bit more substance, but I recommend this book as well.	2005-07-26

On some levels I did, but on others it was a miss.<br /><br />Basically, this is just fun little sci-fi book. It doesn't look like the author was interested in building too much support for his universe, or else he is hoping that you will buy the rest of the series. It felt like he didn't do much planning with the setting...he just picked out one or two ideas that he liked and let the rest build itself.<br /><br />The characters were simple, but still fun. I liked Sten, and didn't really care about much of his motivation. Again, it didn't look like the author gave much thought to the cast, but in this case, I wasn't really bothered by it.<br /><br />The action was amusing, if the reader goes in with the mindset of having fun. If you are looking for literary genius, you'll lose.<br /><br />BTW...I've never seen a scottish accent put down in print before! It was hard to follow!	2005-06-27

Last year, I gave this book to my father for Christmas. He seemed to really enjoy it, and this year he gave it back to me to read. Lucky me!<br /><br />As you can tell from the title, this book is a general history of mapmaking. The subject matter didn't exactly jump off of the page and slap me in the face when I sat down to read it, but Wilford has a very even writing style that kept me very interested in the subject matter.<br /><br />As I read, I discovered that although I am very much a lover of history, I really had no idea how mapmaking progressed through history. I always took for granted the maps that were presented to me, never really understanding what was involved in the creation of them.<br /><br />It's a facinating story, and learning it has deepened my understanding of history. Wilford's account of the story kept me engrossed, and all the while he was feeding me names of people and places that I really should have known more about prior to reading this book. For example, I had no idea who John Harrison was before opening this book, but now realize just how important his invention of an accurate marine clock was to the history of the world. There are gems of knowledge throughout this book, and thankfully they are presented in an entertaining way.<br /><br />The only time I can say that I became a bit lost was when Wilford was discussing some of the mathematical points of mapmaking, but luckly for me he kept this discussion to a minimum. Wilford did an excellent job of presenting the history of something he seems to care very much about to the layperson. I believe that anyone who has even a passing interest in history to give this book a try. It may open your eyes to a world that you knew existed, but had no idea how it was made.	2005-02-14

The book follows the adventures of the young man Talon of the Silver Hawk, who is the last survivor of a race of people slaughtered by a power seeking nobleman. He is saved by a group of people opposed to this nobleman, and they train him to become a weapon for the cause of good.<br /><br />The Good: The book never really slows down, and Feist keep the reader interested in the core story. He creates some interesting characters, and I like what he was attempting to do with this tale. Unfortunately...<br /><br />The Bad: This remined me more of a movie script than anything resembling his older work. From the start of every chapter, this book reads like Feist is picturing a camera on his heroes...or maybe a computer game? Anyway, this really wore on me after a while. I've never felt so beaten over the head with the feeling of a book being written for a purpose other then just telling a story. The whole thing smacked of commercialism.<br /><br />The characters, while interesting, came across as wooden to me. In past Feist books, I was drawn deeply into the characters, and they were the strength of the story. In this book, I got the feeling that the plot was the main focus, and while the story is about the life of Talon, I never really saw his deeper self, and couldn't really like his character.<br /><br />The plot itself was imaginative for the genre, but the story itself was predictable. While it was obvious Feist telegraphed his motivations (maybe to make the cutscenes work better or limit the character choices on a dialog screen?), I wasn't very surprised at how the book flowed. Think James Bond in Midkemia, and you can probably guess how the story will end.<br /><br />I wasn't terribly impressed with this book. I know he can do better, because I've read better. There was a time when I thought Feist was one of the best in the genre. This book wasn't the type of work I expected from him. I may read the second and third book, but only if I see them on a bargin rack.e type of work I expected from him.

Isherwood Williams is for some reason spared from this plague, and finds himself a survivor in a barren society. The book follows the course of his life, and that of other survivors, as they live out their days in a new world.<br /><br />My opinions ran wild with this book. For reason I will explain further along in the review, I started out very much enjoying the book, then my interest waned, and finally something clicked into place in my pea-sized brain, allowing me to finish the book on a strong note.<br /><br />I found it very easy to step into the mind of Ish. He reacted in a way to his situation that I felt was very natural, while learning how to cope with life alone. I don't want to give much of the plot away, but roughly the first third of the book deals with Ish's life alone. Ish starts out as something of a loner and a worrier, and seems to adjust to the world...for a while. Soon, he becomes desperate for a purpose, and with that notion, sets out to find out \\"what happened\\".<br /><br />Later, Ish struggles with his own weaknesses while trying to decide how to save the future. Through it all, Stewart keeps the characters consistant. I found it refreshing that he didn't try to thrust someone into the heroic role. For whatever reason, this earned him a good amount of credibility with me.<br /><br />A note on the writing style; I believe this book was written in 1949, so the flow of the book seemed a little odd to me. Some of the conversations just didn't flow well, and I chalked that up to the age of the book. On the other hand, Stewart's timeline fit right in with the world we live in today, and did not really date the book. Except maybe for spraying DDT around like it was air freshener.<br /><br />Around the middle of the book, I started to lose interest. I guess for me the story sort of bogged down with Ish trying, and consistantly failing, to get his people to try to focus on the finer things in life. As I said earlier, when things finally \\"clicked\\" for me, I found myself appreciating this part of the book more, as it fit in very well with who Ish was and what his purpose was.<br /><br />The ending was just magnificant. I very much felt what Ish was feeling, and clearly saw that he had finally accepted that things were going to work out for his decendants, even if things didn't turn out exactly as he had planned. I can't stress enough how good of a job Stewart did with the ending.<br /><br />This is not an action novel, and at points did become a bit too philosophical for it's own good.

This book gives the reader an excellent insight into the mind of one of the most colorful and reknowned military leaders in history. The book is his war diary, so it is filled with dates and facts about the war, but is also meshed with the thoughts of General Patton on the course of the war. As a fan of Patton's, I found the book to be incredibly enlightening, especially the end sections on his views of the principles of military operations.<br /><br />I do have to say that if a reader is not a big fan of Patton, they may find this book to be a rather boring read. Part of the allure of this book is Patton's interpretation of events, so if you aren't into his views...well, there is no shortage of his opinions within!	2004-12-04

The book doesn't take long to get rolling, and there is plenty of action for the fan of space combat.<br /><br />First, a quick word about the universe. This book is set in the universe of the tactical space wargame Starfire. I've never played the game, in fact, I'd not heard of it until I saw it mentioned on the cover of this book and did a little research. There seems to be an entire history behind this game, and I'm thinking that a fan of the game might have been able to get a little more out of this book than I did. The authors don't really go into this backstory very deeply, and the reader might have a hard time following along. A quick search for Starfire on the internet took me to a few sites where I was able to get a little information, but I still felt like this book was written for someone who knew a little more about the universe. Maybe this won't bother some people. It's just something I noticed.<br /><br />The writing started out a bit weak. It seemed like the author was trying too hard to be writer, if that makes sense. Once the action began to roll, the writing seemed to come together, or else I was caught up in the story enough not to notice the feeling that I'd had earlier.<br /><br />I've seen reviews of this book where they come down on the authors for tying the storyline too closely to the American Revolutionary War. The similarities are obvious, but I didn't really have a problem with it. In a universe where the enemies of humanity are stereotypical enemies ripped right from the pages of other sci-fi works, borrowing a historical event and moving it into the future seemed like it would make for a fun story, which it did.<br /><br />To sum up, if you are looking for a fun space opera with action galore, this book is for you. If you are looking for great prose, deep plot, or interesting characters, you might want to keep going, but I think if you have even a slight interest in space operas, you'll find this book hard to put down.terest in space operas, you'll find this book hard to put down. <br />	2004-11-24

I REALLY wanted to, but I won't.<br /><br />I believe it would be best to say that said laugh out loud factor is very, very high. We're talking coke out of your nostrils moments. If you like sarcastic humor, this book has it. Immature humor fan? Check. How about silly? Yup. Fart jokes? Not that I saw, but maybe I missed them. Still, that doesn't take much away from the humor.<br />This is one of the funniest books I have ever read. My wife made me stop reading it before bed because my laughter would keep her up.<br /><br />Since humor is so subjective, I can't guarantee that you'll like this book, and it is crude in parts.

When my friend recommended this book to me, his comments left me with the impression that it was going to delve more into the history side of these operations, but the reality is that the history is presented more as a wrapper for the stories within. The individual stories make up the bulk of the book, but I feel like I came away with a better understanding of the overall progress of the struggle thanks to the author's added notes.<br /><br />I've been an enthusiast of all things military for most of my life, but I have to admit I didn't know much of anything about the world of submarine esponage. Of course I'd read Clancy, and other sources about attack boats stalking one another and \\"boomers\\" sneaking away to a dark, deep spot in the sea for months at a time, but I no idea of all of the different missions the sub force had undertaken. From recovering fragments of missile parts, to physically tapping undersea cables, I was pretty impressed. The author did a fine job of presenting the sailors as flesh and blood people, and not bit parts in the bigger historical picture. Since the book is mainly about the stories themselves, this may seem obvious, but in the past I have not always found this to be the case. Sontag and Drew did a good job of being true to the spirit of the book and letting the story tell itself. I could really feel like what was written down on the page was passed onto them directly from the people who were actually there.<br /><br />Like others, I was surprised that much of this information was avaliable to the authors at all. Some of these missions seem like the type of thing the get recorded and locked away forever in some vault. I applaude the authors for the groundwork they must have done to gather all of this information and succeed in presenting it in a well thought out format.<br /><br />I found myself wishing there were a few more stories from the later year, maybe the 80's and 90's, but I'm sure that is probably still locked away somewhere. I would be interested in reading about how the sub espionage business is conducted in today's post 9-11 world, but I guess if someone where to tell me about it, they'd have to kill me.

There are times in my life where I wish I could have faith in something I can't explain. I love the idea of ghosts walking beside me. I am facinated by dreams of an advanced race of beings coming to earth and sharing their cosmic wisdom with us, helping to put an end to our bloody wars. So when I saw this book, I thought that it might help me decide once and for all where I stood. Am I a dreamer or a doubter? Take your best shot, Sagan.<br /><br />Well, it wasn't what I expected. Sagan didn't come at me with each controversial theory and rip it apart with his scientific mind. He did do this on a limited basis, but that wasn't really the focus of the book. This isn't Penn and Teller. It really boils down Sagan trying to educate people on the power of thinking.<br /><br />Did I agree with everything Sagan has to say on this subject? Of course not. Did Sagan help me decide which side of the fence I would live on? Nope. But this book did teach me about how to search for answers to things that I may accept without thinking, which seems the logical thing to do when people WANT to believe in something strongly enough. I also learned that searching for answers doesn't make you a cynic, just someone who likes to look before they leap.<br /><br />If you decide to pick this book up, which I would recommend you do if the subject matter intests you, understanding what this book is and is not might help you in the long run. It's not a book debunking myths. It's more an illustration of Sagan's belief that those who think will achieve.	2004-10-26

In typical Pratchett style, things get pretty silly as the Four Bikers of the Apocolypse ride forth while being opposed by and angel, a demon, a prophetess and a prostitute, among others. I don't want to spoil the end for you, but I will say that Gaiman has his fingerprints all over this book.<br /><br />The Good: Well, the book is pretty damn funny. I will warn you ahead of time that if you aren't a fan of either author, then this isn't the book for you. That may seem obvious to you, but you never really know.<br /><br />Pratchett is himself, which is a big plus. The way the man can crack me up with a simple comment from a character such as \\"...\\" or \\"Urg\\", or from a description of a bank of computers can have me rolling is amazing. I really look forward to reading his books, as he never fails to amuse me.<br /><br />As for Gaiman, I only have experience with him from Neverwhere, which I enjoyed, but I could see his flavor coming through the characters. It was a little strange, seeing his introspections mixed with Pratchett's crazy humor, but most of the time I enjoyed the mix. I can say that this book wouldn't have probably been as good if either were not part of it.<br /><br />The Bad: Maybe it was just me, but I was expecting a little more laugh out loud moments. This may not be fair, as the book was published over 14 years ago, and as mentioned before I love Pratchett, so it's possible that I am overcritical, but that's the beauty of book reviews. This takes it down a few notches.<br /><br />Also, some of the purely English jokes lost me, which isn't really a knock, it's just a note.<br /><br />Conclusion: I enjoyed this book, but as I noted above I was probably expecting more then is fair. The book probably wouldn't have been as fun if not for the collaboration, though. Each author has his influence on the book, and it can clearly be seen.

Particularly in the Villa Straylight, where he describes a scene, he left it in a state where my mind could build it's own picture, rather than the picture that he may have intended. I find that writing like this is a rare find, and I very much enjoy it.<br /><br />A few of the characters have appeared before in other stories, such as Molly from Johnny Memnonic. She even makes reference to him in the story. This allowed me to build on the world that I had imagined in that story, and keep my mental picture of her more or less intact, although she'd been through a lot between the stories.<br /><br />Overall, Gibson's portrait of the Matrix was the same that I had built from a number of sources, but this read like the foundation of everything. Shadowrun oozed from the pages. The Matrix seemed like the next logical step. When Case was riding the Chinese virus through the depths of the T-A computer system, I conjured up images of every damn 'net game I've ever played, especially Shadowrun for the Sega Genesis. Sweet!<br /><br />What I wasn't expecting, but I liked, was the depth of consiparacy in the story. I wasn't sure what I was expecting, but it was a sci-fi story, mixed with a detective story, and a study in human behavior wrapped around if for good measure. It's a bit complicated, and I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but let's just say that I wasn't able to guess what would happen next.<br /><br />The Bad: Gibson drops you right into the world and says, \\"Good luck.\\" I can easily see how that would confuse the hell out of a reader. Since I've been exposed to this sort of story before, it wasn't too hard to wrap my mind around the terminology, but I don't think it would be a given that someone reading this book would have that sort of exposure.<br /><br />Also, Gibson's loose descriptions might make a reader uncomfortable also. There are definate advantages to having the scene painted out in detail for you. It can make a story feel more comfortable. This book doesn't do that, and I found that I would have to go back at time and try to figure out what just happened in a particular instance.<br /><br />While I very much liked the characters, every single on of them was flawed in some way. I'm glad I could still identify and root for the main characters, but it can be a little depressing sometimes.<br /><br />Conclusion: Just an excellent book overall, if a bit loose. I'd have to say that I can understand some of the criticism that this book has been subjected to, but I can also justify the heaps of praise. I would recommend this book to anyone.u right into the world and says, \\"Good luck.\\" I can easily see how that would confuse the hell out of a reader.

Now I have to wonder why I waited so long to read it! I guess maybe I had Gibson locked into my images of cyberspace, Shadowrun, the Matrix, and so on. The short stories in this book showed me that he has much more range that that.<br /><br />I can see where his writing style could be off-putting to some. Tech terms abound, and you don't come away from most of the stories feeling good about life. On the plus side, when I let myself get into the story, Gibson's words took me into his world like few authors ever have. Definately an excellent read, and I'm glad I started with this book.	2004-08-22

The back story was excellent and plausible, allowing the reader to watch the characters being built from the ground up. Then, we basically skip to the decision to leave Athens and fight for Cyrus. Ford's decision here didn't concern me too much, either, as he had to get to the main plot of the book at some point.<br /><br />Following Cyrus to Cunaxa is wonderful reading. Actually, everything was going along wonderfully until Clearchus is betrayed. At this point, I felt like Ford was just trying to end the novel, but I could still feel for the men and their struggle. However, the closer the men came to the Black Sea coast, the faster the novel advanced and the thinner the story became. If he had fleshed out the ending a bit more, this wouldn't have bothered me as much, but the ending just sort of...happened. It left me expecting more, instead of wanting more. For me, that's disappointing.<br /><br />As for Ford's writing style, I enjoyed it for the most part, but at some points the character's introspection seemed a bit awkward and forced. As for the \\"love story\\", I didn't feel much, but maybe I wasn't supposed to.<br /><br />I would have given this book four stars if I hadn't felt the way I did at the end. If Ford had kept the momentum of the early book throughout, this would have easily been a 5 star review for me.<br /><br />Seeing what he is capable of, I'll probably give Gods and Legions a try.	2004-08-20

He gives insights into the men who ran the country during that decade of change, and helps to introduce the reader to the men as they really were, not necessarily who they seemed to be. I found Goodwin to be a very truthful author, which is important to me.<br /><br />Goodwin is very much a free thinker, often taking actions that he feels are \\"right\\", rather than those that would be best for his career. I found this refreshing, and maybe this is more of Goodwin remembering how things should have been rather than how things really were, but I have found no evidence to refute his claims. He presents everything in a thoughful way, rather than a dry recounting of facts.<br /><br />A note on the tone of the book: If you can't stomach liberal politics, then this is not the book for you. Goodwin wanted to change the world, and that world would have been one laden with liberal policies. Conservatives may end up beating themselves over the head with this book. You have been warned! :)	2004-08-09

The Belgariad, and specifically Pawn of Prophecy, were solely responsible for turning me on to fantasy.<br /><br />A friend of mine recommended this series to me when I worked at a book store with him. I was able to procure the first book, and finished it in one night! The plot is the foundation for many fantasy series that followed, just different variations on the theme.<br /><br />Eddings created a very rich world for his characters to wander through, with colorful characters that the reader can really care about and get to know. Sure they may seem simple now, but at the time, I was enthralled.<br /><br />If you have even a passing interest in the fantasy world, I whole-heartedly recommend this book and the many that follow. Maybe it will change your life like it did mine!	2004-08-04

Many of the stories in this book are told with a personal perspective, which was enjoyable. It's an interesting read, but at times seems a bit disjointed, but I think that this is mostly because many of the entries were originally independant newpaper columns.<br />If you have ever been curious about the history of Dallas, I would highly recommend this book!	2004-07-01
US	36662493	R109GPE10ONPZ1	0061020699	863190678	Equal Rites	Books	4	3	3	N	N	I was warned	Some friends told me that Equal Rights was quite a departure from the first two Discworld books, and they were right. When I first started the book, I felt a bit like I was reading a different author. I struggled to find the humor in the book. The characters were interesting, but did not seem as flawed as Twoflower and Rincewind. The story kept me in it though, and I'm glad it did. The end was just what I have come to expect from Pratchett. I happen to think that the exchange between Granny and the Head Wizard is some of his funniest writing so far, which is saying something.	2004-06-23

You may find yourself wishing for a bright side to this story. Maybe you can find one, because I couldn't. I believe that Strieber was able to get his point across, however.	2004-04-30

This book opened my eyes to a new view of the war, regrettably one which I was quick to overlook in the past. I recommend this book to anyone with more than a passing interest in the history of WWII. It may be a bit too detailed for the casual reader.	2004-04-15

It was a really hard book to put down, but that's not much of a problem with a 200 page book. Funny, imaginative, and fun would describe this book best. I look forward to reading the rest! My only gripe is that it's hard to spend $6.99 for each book since they are digested so quickly...but hey, it's worth it.	2004-04-09

I've tried to read this book 3 times, but the deeper I get into the book, the more lost I become. I plan on trying to read it again after I reread the entire series, so that maybe I'll be able to remember some of the names that fly off of the page and pound my brain into submission.

Books	5	2	2	N	N	Another perspective	This book did a wonderful job of portrying the war from the Japanese perspective, and really gave me an insight into the mind of the &quot;enemy&quot;. Sakai proves that he is indeed human, but not in a way that many westerners readily understand. It was an eye opener for me for sure.<br />Have to say that Sakai has to be one of the toughest SOBs in the world, flying back to base with wounds that would have killed most people, and landing safely!!!	2004-03-16
