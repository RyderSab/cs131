Nothing earth-shattering on  either extreme:  I didn't love it, and I didn't hate it.  Things that I  liked:  the main character, Rodney, was a pretty nice guy; his sister,  Roberta, is funny, sassy, sharp-tongued, and loves her brother dearly;  George writes in very vivid descriptive detail (I felt like I was in L.A.  myself, and I've never been there before).  Things I didn't like:  the  whole premise of the book (a thirty-something successful black male feeling  pressure to get married after his friend's wedding, and hounding from his  mother, sister, and nieces?  A little farfetched); the method Rodney used  to seek out his future bride (a list of 133 old flames - how do you even  narrow it down to 3 - and why the 3 losers he picked?); and as another  reviewer pointed out, there was too much narration, and not enough  dialogue.  Overall, it was, like I said, an &quot;okay&quot; book.  I think  it may have been better if George had developed the characters, and  Rodney's relationship to them, more.  This was definitely better than Urban  Romance.  And even though it appears that George's writing style just  doesn't appeal to me, since I already have it, I'll read Seduced as well.	2000-09-06

It's a mystery, with a little (unlikely) romance  thrown into the mix.  Marissa really got on my nerves at the beginning of  the book, with four relationships she's juggling, and her disinterest in  any man that actually is available.  But, boy did I start to feel for her  when the stalker started coming after her with a vengeance.  As the other  reviewer of this book mentioned, I could not put the book down, I just had  to find out who wanted Marissa dead so badly.  I thought the potential  killer was everybody EXCEPT who it really was!  Mallette did an excellent  job of holding my interest, keeping me in suspense, and giving a crazy  twist to the relationship/dating/marriage game.  I was very impressed, and  I highly recommend this book.	2000-08-29

With poetic words and beautiful, descriptive detail, Bandele  tells the reader how and why she came to marry a man serving 20 years to  life, and what she has gained and sacrificed  by being with him. She really  bares her soul, and shares deeply personal and painful information about  her past, and about her marriage.  When I started reading this book,  someone saw the title, and started saying how they couldn't understand why  so many women marry men who are incarcerated.  And, before I read this  book, I wondered the same thing.  But what I got out of The Prisoner's Wife  is that just like in a relationship between two people in the outside  world, asha and Rashid had needs, and they have helped one another in  fulfilling those needs.  Even though my own husband is not in prison, I saw  a lot of similarities between asha and Rashid's relationship and ours.  And  I can understand 100%  what she writes at the end of the first chapter:   &quot;We were exactly the same and we were completely different...never  meant to be together...always meant to save each other.&quot;  I was very  touched by this story, and devoured this book in a day.  The only thing I  was disappointed by was the ending.  I didn't quite understand the purpose  of the letter, or what happened to make Bandele write it.  And because of  that lack of clarity, I was left wondering about their relationship.   Otherwise, this was an excellent, beautiful, touching book.	2000-08-29

I'm sitting here trying to think of what I want to say about it.  It's definitely different from what I've been  reading lately.  Given that fact that this story was strictly for  entertainment purposes, I will not go into how unrealistic it is, because,  it wasn't meant to be realistic.  But it was funny, and I couldn't help  thinking about how many times I've wished I could &quot;pull a Sasha&quot;  on someone who hurt or wronged me or a loved one!  I mean, Sasha really  took out some lowlife men - a wife abuser, a shady preacher, a rapist.  I  got a kick out of this book.  My husband wanted me to stop reading it,  because he didn't want me to get any ideas from Sasha!  I liked how the  story was told from both Sasha and Rock's point of view.  However, there  were some points in some chapters where Haskins flipped over to another  character's point of view, and I was lost.  And the book had so many  grammatical errors and typos, that it was downright distracting.   Especially the lack of quotation marks where there should have been some,  and the placement of quotation marks where they weren't necessary.  But, I  still gave the book 4 stars, because it held my attention, made me laugh,  and gave me a nice break from reality.  Unfortunately, the ending was a big  let-down.	2000-08-17

I was going to give this book 3 stars, but I added one more, because even though it was full of grammatical errors, and was written in an overly-simplistic manner, Tasha's story is all too real, and therefore  needs to be read by everyone.  Having experienced many of the situations  Tasha and her siblings went through myself, I could relate to her story a  little too well, and was just disgusted at the things BOTH of the parents  did and said to their children.  This book is very small, and can be read  in one sitting, but it still has a strong impact.  I'm sharing it with as  many people as possible, because I have found in sharing my own history  with other people I know, that there are a lot more Tashas around me than I  ever realized.  I applaud Ms. Matthews for sharing such a painful, personal  story.  It needs to be told.  As long as victims of child abuse remain  silent, healing can never begin.	2000-08-15

I bought Something's Wrong With Your Scale! because I read Beeperless  Remote, and really liked it.  When I first started reading SWWYS! I didn't  think I was going to like it.  But after about the first chapter, I started  to warm up to the book.  And I really started to feel for Sonny and Kayla,  especially in the scenes where other people treated them like they weren't  even human just because they were overweight.  I have never had a weight  problem myself, but I think Whitfield did an excellent job of showing me  what it feels like to have a &quot;battle of the bulge.&quot;  I  particularly liked the scene where Sonny, Chet, and E got drunk, and Sonny  finally told them about themselves!  They had bigger personal problems than  Sonny, yet they had the nerve to treat him like some kind of outcast  because of his weight, and because he was dating an overweight woman.  Even  though Whitfield told Sonny's story in a rather comical, lighthearted  manner, he made some pretty serious points about the level of disrespect  shown to overweight people, and about the need to lose weight because of  internal factors, instead of external ones.  Even in Sonny's relationship  with Kayla, Whitfield was making a BIG statement in showing us how even an  overweight man has problems with dating and being seen in public with an  overweight woman.  Big GUYS definitely get cut more slack than big GIRLS in  this society.  I think that may be why Kayla appears to never really win  her battle with the bulge.  It seems like she was almost rebelling against  everyone else's insistence that she lose weight.  She was a pretty good  woman (smart, doing well financially, funny, witty, bold, and just an  all-round nice person), yet she was treated like a leper because of her  weight (especially in the clothing store scene).  Well, as you can see, I  got a lot out of the book, even though it's a light easy read.  I see some  of the criticism of other reviewers of this book, but I find Whitfield's  writing to be different from the standard popular African-American authors  out today, so I enjoy reading his books.  He's different, and after all,  variety is the spice of life.	2000-08-15

The main character, Claire, tells the story of how she learns to move on with her life after her husband,  James, leaves her the day she gives birth to their daughter.  Claire is a  lighthearted character, and even when she's in tremendous pain over the  deception and betrayal of her husband, she tells the reader all about it in  a very comical manner.  Claire's family, an odd and entertaining bunch  themselves, are very supportive and loving while she heals from her pain  and waits to see what will become of her marriage.  And Adam, a handsome,  younger man also helps Claire heal and see herself in a very different  light.  Claire has a witty, endearing voice that will make you love her  immediately.  The story itself is very interesting, and is told in a very  comical manner, so you won't be able to put the book down.  And the ending  is very funny.  Watermelon is an excellent summer read.	2000-08-13

Sungee did a good job of balancing the various character's stories, and then tying them all  together. The two main characters, Senida and Maya, who are best friends,  both knew how to stay in trouble with the men!  Senida had some deep-rooted  problems, though, and at times, I found her very unlikable because of her  trifling behavior.  Maya was a much more likable character.  But all of the  characters in the book were interesting, and even though the book moved a  little too slowly for me, I stuck with it because I wanted to know how  things would turn out for everyone.  There were some very funny parts (like  when Senida got just what she deserved at the beginning of the book, and  the church scene).  There were some sad scenes (like the funeral, and when  Maya confronted Jelani about his past).  There were some hot sex scenes and  massive amounts of drama.  All of these things made Picking Up The Pieces a  very good book.  But I couldn't give it that fifth star because there were  some less-than-successful aspects of the book.  For instance, I know Sungee  tried to make Senida's lover a surprise that we find out about at Mandla's  party, but anyone who read the book probably already knew way before they  got to that scene in the book.  Also, the thing with Jelani's hidden  career:  Maya should have known she was dealing with some type of celebrity  when those boys came asking for his autograph!  And with all of the  negative press he had gotten in his past, how could she NOT know who he  was!   That made her look stupid.  And Maya and Senida were supposed to be  best friends, yet they didn't even contact each other when both of them had  gone through some serious drama in their love lives!  In fact, after all  that happened to both of them, they don't even speak to each other again at  the close of the book.  My best friend no longer even lives in the same  state that I live in, but if what happened to Senida or Maya happened to  me, I'd be on the phone crying to her about it in a heartbeat!  But even  with those flaws, I still thought it was a pretty good first book.  As  several other reviewers pointed out, the ending left a little something to  be desired, but that always leaves the door open for a sequel!  I agree  with another reviewer who said the sequel should be named Picking Up The  Pieces, and this book should have another title (perhaps All The Stuff Has  Hit The Fan!).	2000-08-13

So when I read the back cover of He Say, She Say, I  thought to myself, &quot;Joe must really like the name Bebe, she has two  books with a character by that name.&quot; Then I started reading the book,  and I realized it was the same Bebe from Bebe's By Golly Wow.   I thought  He Say, She Say was a pretty good book.  I like how Joe told the story from  four different character's perspectives, yet kept it flowing smoothly.  I  also liked the characters.  Joe's writing style is rather simplistic, but  it makes for a fast read.  I didn't like Chapters 60-62, because what  should have been a very serious, passionate discussion between Sandy and  T.J. turned into a mini-sermon about the differences between men and women.   It made their situation too trivial.  The scene where Sandy gets revenge  on T.J. was quite funny.  I didn't think ole girl had it in her!  (Well,  she did get some help from Bebe).  I felt let down by how things were left  rather open-ended regarding T.J. and Sandy.  But knowing that there is a  sequel, I'll have to go back and re-read Bebe's By Golly Wow to see what  happened to them.  All in all, He Say, She Say is a fun, quick summer read.	2000-08-09

I love a good  romance, but this was just too much!  And the story moved a little too  slowly for me.  I kept having to put the book down for a few minutes,  because the slow pace of McCann's writing was driving me crazy.  But the  book does have some redeeming qualities.  The characters, especially Betty,  are likable and believable.  Drew was a little unrealistic in my eyes, but  perhaps there are such men out there.  I wanted some questions answered  about the real deal regarding Felicia and her true feelings for Drew, but I  guess McCann left that open to the reader's interpretation, and it also  helped Drew move on with his life.  I liked how things turned out in the  end, but I wish I could have seen more of Drew and Betty's romance once  they got together.  Perhaps a sequel is in order...	2000-08-07

I loved the  main character, Claire, and her zany family.  Her story of healing and  self-discovery after her husband leaves her and their new-born daughter is  touching and funny.  When I first started reading Watermelon, I couldn't  wait for James (her husband) to come back to her (I'm a sucker for romantic  reconciliations).  But, as I saw Claire heal and grow with the help of her  family and Adam, I didn't really want to see James come back into the  picture.  I think everyone got just what they deserved in the end.  And the  ending - well, without giving anything away, that's just the type of thing  I'd expect from that crazy Helen!  Keyes has a great writing style, and I  was hooked on Watermelon from page 1.  This was a great first novel!	2000-08-05

I thought Friends and Lovers was his best book, but Cheaters is head and shoulders above it!  EJD did an excellent job of taking me into the  world of Stephan, Darnell, Chante, Tammy, Karen, and Jake.  The were all  funny, interesting characters who did some crazy (and oftentimes  self-destructive) things in their quest for love (and sex - let's not  forget the sex!)  I love EJD's writing style, and he is at the top of his  form in this book.  I was engrossed in this book from page one, and pretty  much ignored everything and everybody until I finished it.  One thing I  hate about EJD's books is that, they are so engrossing that you end up  finishing them too quickly, and then you're wanting more!  But, I haven't  read Liar's Game yet, so I have something to look forward to.<br />I'll just  say about the outcome of the character's lives in Cheaters:  I was VERY  happy for how things turned out for Stephan and Chante; I was pleasantly  surprised by how things turned out for Darnell (although that part was a  bit dramatic and far-fetched); I hope everything worked out just fine for  poor Tammy; and I hope Karen and Jake seek professional help RIGHT AWAY!   And I like how EJD brings in characters from previous books - I think it's  cute.  I've been a fan since reading Milk in My Coffee last year (my first  EJD book), but just in case you ever happen to read this review, I want to  let you know you have a fan for life!	2000-08-02

I don't think I need to say much, because most of the other reviews hit on everything that's bad about the book:  too many characters, only two of which are paid enough attention to; making  Black women into caricatures to drive home the author's point of finding  happiness in a relationship with someone of another race; using outlandish  adjectives to describe the most common things, just to name a few.  And  what was with the author's obsession with Jews?  All of the characters were  unrealistic.  Aletha is the only one I can buy, because she was a  celebrity, so I could see her being that self-absorbed and expecting things  to always go her way.  But Desiree is just so PERFECT!  Just because she's  a psychologist, and married to a Jewish man?  Get real!  Marrying outside  of your race does not guarantee marital bliss anymore than marrying someone  of the same race does.  I was pretty interested in Veronica's story, but  the author left us hanging.  Debra was absolutely ridiculous, and I can't  tell if Tyson was implying that her negative experiences with Black men had  driven her to lesbianism, or if she was just in such denial that she kept  dating men even though she really liked women.  Either way, that character  looked like a total idiot, and Tyson did a bang-up job of offending  lesbians, Black men, and Black women in one fell swoop.  Janeen and Louise  were both pretty minimal characters, and just plain stupid.  Too stupid for  me to even waste time writing about.  <br />Here's what I got out of reading  Gingersnaps:  psychologists, Jewish MEN, and people in interracial  relationships have got their stuff together.  The rest of us, particularly  Black women who want to be in relationships with Black men, are just crazy.	2000-07-30

I couldn't give the book 5 stars, because it has some flaws.  Like, the beginning of the book, where we read about Zoe's and Jason's childhood, was a little  boring.  But once the story picked up (when they finally hit adulthood), I  couldn't put the book down!  I thought the hynosis scene was a bit much,  but all in all, this book is provocative, and will have you on the edge of  your seat.  I knew in my gut who the killer was before I reached the  ending, but I kept second-guessing myself because the back cover says  &quot;the true murderer is anybody's guess.&quot;  This book is a fun  summer read, and will have you hooked once you get past Zoe's and Jason's  early years.

Like many of the other reviewers of this book, I liked Sinclair's previous books, so I gave this one a try.  I'm sorry I did.  I kept reading and reading, thinking to myself,  &quot;surely this must get better.&quot;  It didn't.  The main character,  Dee Dee, is supposed to be in her forties, but she sounds like she's a  child.  I didn't see any depth to this character at all, or to her  boyfriend, Skylar.  And why Sinclair threw the Bill character in this book,  I'll never know.  I guess just to have a reason to bring Skylar in to  mediate, so he and Dee Dee could meet.  Jade and her story of marital  troubles and feeling unfulfilled was the most interesting aspect of the  book, but Sinclair did a poor job of concluding her story, as if the  revelation of a spouse's secret sexual fantasy will cure a bad marriage.   Basically, everyone in the book seemed to be unhappy with the condition of  their lives, but Sinclair didn't really make their problems very deep or  interesting.  Sinclair took some deep issues and dealt with them in a very  superficial manner, which left me feeling very let down by the book.	2000-07-21

And like any porno flick, the storyline isn't important; the SEX scenes are!  The sad thing about this book is that the story could have actually been interesting, and even  thought-provoking, if Morrison had written the whole book with the fervor  she wrote the sex scenes with, if she had a better editor, and if she had  given her characters a little more depth.  She actually had a pretty good  story, she just didn't give it the proper attention, so it didn't flourish.   I won't even go into how in the world Morrison's characters were such  committed church-going people, when they were giving satan himself a run  for his money the rest of the week.

However, I got a lot out of the book, and I'm 27 years old!  This is a very short book (you could read it in less than an  hour), but it's chock full of beautiful, and painful lessons about female  sexuality, love, relationships, and healing.  My favorite story was House  Arrest, which was written in &quot;Dear Diary&quot; form, and is about a  young woman having to overcome her fear of leaving the house after being  raped coming home one evening. Even though that's a painful issue, the  writer handles it in a rather humorous way.  Other issues addressed are  remaining a virgin, incest survival, a lesbian coming out to her family,  and losing oneself in an unfulfilling relationship, to name a few.  As  another reviewer mentioned, this is an excellent read for ladies of ALL  ages, because we, or someone we know, have faced, or will face some of the  issues addressed in these powerful stories.	2000-07-16

I really enjoyed this touching, funny book about Eva and Hutch, forty-somethings with grown children, and a marriage in crisis.  I think this was an excellent coming-of-age story, even though the main characters  are middle-aged!  And Valerie's writing just flows beautifully.  I think  she did a great job of showing how Eva and Hutch make peace with each  other, their children, their pasts, and most importantly, themselves.  From  looking at the reviews of fans of her Tamara Hayle series, this book isn't  the author's best work.  But, I never read any of the Tamara Hayle books,  because I don't really care for mysteries.  However, after reading Ain't  Nobody's Business, I will be reading about the adventures of Tamara, 'cause  I've just gotta read some more of this talented author's work!

I finished reading this book yesterday, and I'm still in awe!  DeBerry and Grant did a superb job of telling a beautiful story of frienship, betrayal, love, forgiveness, and letting go of the pain of the past.  I wonder how  the authors went about writing the book together, because it reads as  though it was written by one person.  One person with a profound voice, and  a way with words that had me laughing out loud at some points, pissed off  at some points, and crying like a baby at other points.  And the way they  wrote that Ramsey character!  I fell in love with him right along with  Gayle in the scene where she lost her virginity to him!  And I was ready to  take him back for Gayle in that scene in the cemetary!  I think I identify  more with Gayle than with any of the other characters in the book, but I  loved them all!<br />This was definitely one of the best books I've read this  summer, and I would even read it again.

Not a sappy romance novel type of love story, but one where we see two real people dealing with their hopes and fears in a very honest and refreshing manner.  I think Tyree did  a very good job of conveying that leap of faith two people must take if  they want their relationship to grow and be successful.  The best friends  of Ant and Sharon are a bit stereotypical (cynical sidekicks who are too  scared and scarred to find true love themselves).  And Ant as the  &quot;playboy&quot; who is &quot;tamed&quot; by the sweet and wholesome  Sharon, is also a bit stereotypical.  But, I still liked the book.

Boy, was I wrong.  This book was  just WAY too depressing, it was just tragic events piled on top of tragic  events.  I know Roby was striving to teach the lesson of not thinking the  grass is greener on the other side of the fence, but this was a bit much.   Although we do finally get to see some type of light at the end of a very  long tunnel, Lawson spent way too much time depressing us with the painful  details of these women's lives, and then gave a very poorly-thrown-together  happy ending, with everyone having learned their lesson.  I was not  impressed with Lawson's storytelling in this book, but she does have an  impressive writing style, and I will read future books by this author.	2000-07-15

Grown folks were crying too much over every little thing that happened!  They were happy, they cried, they were angry, they cried.  It was just far too overly sappy and  emotional for my taste.  And the writing was terrible.  The author went  from past to present tense at the drop of a dime, and the book was  obviously not proofread and edited.  And the treatment of the characters  was sad to say the least.  The author made them very one-dimensional.  All  of the &quot;good guys&quot; in the story were just so syrupy-sweet and  unflawed, while the one villain, Catherine, was just all evil, practically  the devil incarnate.  Get real!  The characters should have had some depth,  we should have been able to see some strength and weakness, some good and  bad, in everyone involved.  The treatment of these caricatures made this  book nothing more than a poorly told adult fairy tale.  The wicked witch  (Catherine) gets what she deserves and everyone gets to live happily ever  after.  That's not how life works!  I know this is fiction, but I don't  want my intelligence insulted just because it's not a true story.  And the  heinous dialect of Momma C - what were you thinking, Ms. Brown?  I'm just  glad that I didn't buy the book, and someone let me borrow their copy.  I  would have been highly upset if I had spent $14.95 on this sad attempt at  writing.	2000-07-09

Once again, Tyree eloquently tells the story of issues that effect the African-American community.  The book was a bit preachy, especially when told through the eyes of the character Wes,  but the message was good anyway.  I thought &quot;Butterman&quot; was very  foolish to get caught up in the drug-dealing game, especially since he  didn't have to.  I was very pleased that things turned out so well for  Shank, because he was the character one would think would be least likely  to make it out of that lifestyle.  I would love to see this book made into  a movie.  I think Mekhi Phifer would be the perfect guy to play Shank!	2000-06-27

I know a few Curtis Blacks myself, so I know where Kimberla was coming from in telling this story.  I'm usually very wordy in my reviews,  but I'm really left without words after reading this book.  It was THAT  good!  I was totally stunned by the ending, and, though Curtis's story was  extreme, I think anyone who claims to be a Christian can learn a lesson  from his fall from grace.  This is the second book I've read by Roby, and  she has truly grown as a writer in comparison to her first book, Behind  Closed Doors.  She's really a great storyteller.  I'm now reading Here and  Now.  I can't wait to see what new controversial issue Roby will tackle in  her next novel.  Hurry up with your next book, Kim!	2000-01-30

This girl can write!  This was an excellent first novel, fast-paced and funny.  I liked Misty, Reesy kind of got on my nerves, but they are a funny  pair.  I heard really good things about this book, and all of them were  true.  It held my attention, and had me cracking up laughing at times.  I  had to go right out and buy Getting to the Good Part, because I wanted to  see what new adventures these ladies got themselves into this time.  Files  is a great storyteller with a funny, refreshing voice.  I highly recommend  this book.	2000-01-25

I thought the author had a very interesting story with some serious issues involved, but the manner in which she told the story was terrible.  The  story just didn't flow.  She didn't tell the story in a way that made you  care anything about any of the characters, there was no emotion conveyed in  her writing.  The dialogue was EXTREMELY difficult to follow.  And the  highlighting of brand names - what was that for?  Did they pay her to do  it?  And I didn't like the intermingling of Christianity with adultery, and  basically saying it's okay with the character's happy ending.  Things  rarely, if ever, work out that way in adulterous relationships, and God  doesn't condone it, no matter how you try to sugarcoat it.  All my friends  loved the book, we passed it around at work.  I'm just glad I didn't pay  money for it, it was one of the worst books I've ever read.  I think  Grosvenor has some interesting stories to tell, I just hope her  storytelling gets better with her next book.	2000-01-23

It was one of the most shocking and harsh autobiographies I've ever read.  And Shakur pulls no punches; he tells all in a very matter of fact tone.  I really liked the way Shakur takes the  reader through the psychological changes he went through from being Kody  Scott, to Monster, to Sanyika Shakur.  It was very enlightening for me to  learn just how profound an impact gang life has on our youth in California:   it's almost mandatory for their daily survival.  Unfortunately, the very  thing that they need for their &quot;survival&quot; and  &quot;protection&quot; is what is getting them killed.  I, like another  reader who wrote a review on this book, was disappointed that he went back  to prison.  I understand his reaction to drugs being sold in his community,  but he handled the situation incorrectly.  He could do his family and his  community a whole lot more good OUTSIDE of prison than inside.  And I'm  sure that drug dealer is still selling drugs in his community (or some  other drug dealer is).	1999-12-21

I couldn't give it 5 stars because there were a few things I didn't like.  First, the change in point of view in the middle of the book was bad.  Second, I don't  think that enough attention was paid to Kahlil and CeCe's relationship -  and then they let a 7 year relationship go with such ease?  And the ending  - after so much focus was placed on what happened to all of the other  character's, why was Kahlil and CeCe's story so poorly concluded?  What I  did like was the way White left you hanging at the end of every chapter -  that's why I couldn't put the book down.  And every character had so much  drama going on in their lives that I just had to find out what was going to  happen to them next!	1999-12-10

After reading some of the negative reviews of this book, I was kind of hesitant to buy it, but it sounded like an interesting story, so I gave it a try.  I am so glad I did!  I thought Shawn's story of his quest for his  #6 was hilarious.  Shawn was incredibly stupid, but he was a sweet, sincere  guy.  It was refreshing to read about a young black man who was looking for  a healthy relationship with a woman, instead of the usual mack daddy images  that are in many of our books and movies.  I was very happy for Shawn when  he finally found his #6 (Troi had me fooled too).  I hope that Troi's  &quot;good news&quot; doesn't destroy his relationship with Dawn.  Perhaps  Van will write a sequel to let us know how it all works out for Shawn.	1999-12-08

But the book description sounded interesting, so I gave it a try.  I'm glad I did!  I thought that Shawn, while incredibly stupid for his age, was  a sweet, honest, and lovable guy.  His quest for his #6 was filled with  some funny dating experiences, which he took in stride.  I actually found  it refreshing to read about a black man who was sincerely looking for a  good woman to share his life with, instead of the usual mack daddy  characters that are featured in many of our books and movies.  I was very  happy to see Shawn finally find his #6, even though Troi may have put a  strain on his new found love with her &quot;good news.&quot;  I'd love to  read a sequel to find out if her &quot;good news&quot; is true and if it  destroys his chance at happiness with Dawn.  For all the people who gave  this book bad reviews, I have to disagree with you.  I thought Shawn's  story of dating in the 90's was funny, funny, funny.  I finished the book  in a day.  I'm very glad I purchased it.	1999-12-06
US	50727064	RODJX2TYD3WDB	096436753X	885388260	The Maintenance Man	Books	5	3	3	N	N	A Real Page Turner!	Michael has done it again!  I loved this book.  I could not put it down.  I loved both of his other books, but this one is his best so far.  I think the characters in this book were more interesting and more developed than  the ones in MCITD.  I had been looking forward to reading TMM for a couple  of months now, but I was too busy with work and school to do any reading  for pleasure.  I had some time this weekend, so I sat down to read it and  was done in one day.  I was most impressed with the ending.  I was happy to  see a happy ending after what happened to Derrick and Angela at the end of  MCITD.  I was disappointed that there was no closure to the story of Ariel  and Chris.  But overall, it was a very good book, and Michael's growth as a  writer shows.  Hurry up and finish your next book, Michael!	1999-11-30
