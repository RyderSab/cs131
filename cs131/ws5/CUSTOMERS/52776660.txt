But the advice throughout this book is highly suspect, and contradictory to the advice given by professional bodies of expertise including the American Pediatic Association, American Medical Association, and others.<br /><br />Sure, many issues are matters of dispute, and science changes. Perhaps the APA, AMA, and others are simply wrong on all points of contention, and Dr. Denmark is a lone voice of reason, and pehaps we'll all come to recognize that someday. But Denmark's doesn't come off as reasoned; it's very clearly hyperbole at best, if not complete rubbish. The very language of her claims are so overstated as to damn her credibility.<br /><br />As just one example, consider what she says about tubes for ear infections, which helped my brother, wife, and brother-in-law overcome infections when young: \\"Tubes are a money-making thing, but they have never helped any child under the sun.\\" (p.83) No one being responsible about a scientific claim vis-a-vis the weight of available evidence would dare say something so extreme. If there is doubt as to whether tubes are necessary in any particular case, there must also be doubt that perhaps there are conditions in which tubes *have* helped.<br /><br />Throughout, Denmark doesn't leave room for doubt, and that's a gross scientific error. To honestly and forthrightly address matters of contention (and I'm not convinced that tubes are nearly as contentious as Denmark implies), one ought to balance the weight of evidence and formulate probabilistic claims, not damnations of exclusivity.<br /><br />In short? At best, she goes overboard; at worst, she's misguided and misguiding. Take every page with a grain of salt and a pound of caution.	2005-08-18

Nice collection of quotes from a few dozen reality shows, grouped into topical mini-chapters. They really are mini. There's only content on about two thirds of the pages, with almost 1 of every six blank before a full-page \\"chapter\\" heading, leaving 4 for quotes and, uh, witty? repertoire.<br /><br />That's the problem. It's just not that funny. The quotes themselves are okay. Not the best. And not the most popular or well-known or even telling. A bunch to which Volk can reply with short quips that may or may not been intended to be funny - I couldn't tell.<br /><br />On the other hand, it's quick mindless read that can be read in 30 second stops over a few days without doing great harm or causing great waste.

Better offerings range from a US military guide (including one edition with a foreward by Survivor producer Mark Burnett) to a few offerings about radically unusual situations (what to do in a hostage crisis, or if you're bitten by a crocodile, etc.) Nonetheless, it's a fine sampling of tips for situations that you might (but probably won't) find yourself in.<br /><br />Howevever, it's terribly misrepresented, on its cover and on this page. The font for the title, the use of the word \\"castaway\\" (a term used on CBS's Survivor), the coastal photograph (alluding to most seasons of Survivor, but to only a limited number of situations in the book), and the sales offerings (such as getting this plus Spoiler, about someone who regularly predicted Survivor happenings in advance) all suggest or imply that this book has ANYTHING to do with that reality show.<br /><br />It doesn't.	2005-06-22

And Rudy answers them all as anyone who's heard him speak would expect him to - straight-forward, based on a long life of experience, with a great deal of simplicity, and without much consistency (especially on topics political and sociological).<br /><br />But Herman's presentation is grandly stilted, presenting himself as more refined than Rudy (as if we couldn't already imagine that he probably was) and \\"clarifying\\" Rudy's answers even when they don't need it.<br /><br />It's unlikely, for example, that Herman used \\"et al.\\" (Latin for others; in the phrase \\"Washington, Jefferson, et al.\\", on p.135) in a question, but he prints that in the book, instead of printing the question as he probably asked it (\\"...and others\\"). Conversely, when Rudy mentions \\"The Mole\\", Herman sees fit (on p.40) to add in \\"[TV show]\\" even though the answer is clearly about TV shows, and even though the question includes the phrase \\"reality shows on TV\\".<br /><br />Herman's comfortable asking the Vietnam-related question (on p.67) \\"Did the North have good soldiers?\\", but apparently needs to clarify Rudy's answer with a bracket: \\"They [the Vietcong] were worthy opponents.\\" But if \\"the North\\" suffices as a reference to the political entity of northern Vietnam, then \\"They\\" suffices as a reference to \\"good soldiers\\". Herman's editing makes it look like Rudy is ambiguous or insufficient. He isn't.<br /><br />He even gets some basic concepts wrong, such as (on the first page) saying Rudy is \\"well into his seventh decade\\". (Rudy's in his seventies, and so well into his *eighth* decade.)<br /><br />Despite Herman's slant and ego, Survivor fanatics will enjoy spending a bit more time with Rudy. You won't be enlightened, and you won't learn much. (You probably already know that he was one of the first SEALs, and there's scant detail about that.) But it was a good quick read I kept in the bathroom and finished in three days over the course of short breaks.t was a good quick read I kept in the bathroom and finished in three days over the course of short breaks.	2005-06-22

I was troubled by the first version's compilation of press photos with prose that read like official bios, with few details about actual album releases, and with an unswerving politeness throughout about all of the acts included.<br />Here, instead, are a nice seletion of live photos, with studied attention to select releases, and even a ratings system which comparatively evaluates those releases, combined with fair and balanced reflections in Dean's inimitable writing style.<br />You still won't find the level of forthrightness you might want from a music critic. (No one included &quot;sucks&quot; if you accept Dean's spin. Perhaps this is because he's weeded out the carp, but even many of those included wallow in mediocrity.) But the break from a glossy fluff package towards an in-depth and reflective study is a quantum leap above and beyond the earlier book. And the presentation, layout, and overall delivery is a far more engaging and enticing package.<br />Besides, Dean's not a music critic. He's an historian and a scholar of American culture, and that's what you'll get here: a thorough slice of jambands currency, an historic epoch in American culture.	2004-01-31

I was subjected to an earlier edition when I took statistics as an undergraduate, and I've used the 2nd and 3rd editions as a lecturer and professor, and I believe there is no preferable alternative.<br />Agresti and Finlay are, above all, clear and accurate. Over the last decade, I've looked at several dozen alternatives, hoping to find one that's strong in the areas where this text is weak. I've been enticed by different layouts, writing styles, even overall motifs, but am always reminded of why I (and others) have relied on this text for so long.<br />Some alternatives are just sloppy - poor editing, excessive typographic errors, incorrect answers in the answer keys. Some others border on incompetent, confusing basic issues and not clarifying the disputes on border issues. And some, while achieving rapport through comics, comedy, or simply light humor, lose some of the subtle finesse that statistics entails.<br />Now, this one ain't perfect. The subtleties and disputes are side-stepped rather than highlighted. The text and layout are a bit wordy and eye-hard. And the examples are more practical than pedagogical. The data examples could be a bit sexier.<br />But the meat is all there, and correct, and clear. And that's what you want in a statistics textbook. You don't need something that pretends stats is inherently fun or exciting. The lecturer should convey the power of p, the coolness of coefficients, and the holy grail of \\"r-squared\\". The text book should cover the material accurately and in detail, and this one does.	2003-09-16

I learned about this book because it attracted a hasty and baseless lawsuit from FOX News, who tried to claim ownership of the phrase \\"fair and balanced\\" used in the book's subtitle.<br />That's interesting because it shows how screwy FOX executives are, and because the little guy (Franken's not so tall) won out over the fat Goliath (FOX executives are typically overweight and aggressive, though not all as big, fat, or idiotic as Rush Limbaugh). But it also marks the biggest stride FOX has made towards fulfilling the \\"balanced\\" part of their motto:<br />Thanks to that arch-conservative, spin-rich, selective-coverage network that usually presents only the pig-headed narrow-vision clap-trap of the middle-right, I've been exposed to a scathing piece of liberal fun-poking.<br />Being part of that balancing act is worth the price of admission alone. Think about it: Franken had to write a book, and even be funny a few times, in order to stick a thorn in FOX's side. You can do it for only a few bucks, helping to drive up Franken's sales numbers, turning a lawsuit into a backfiring buzz, and getting some chuckles along the way.<br />Bravo, Al - and write that next one faster!	2003-08-28

Find this larger edition if you can, first printed 1992. My version has some pages out of order (which is particularly frustrating in a reference book) but still totally worthwile.<br />There's also a 3x6&quot; pocket version. But if this is to complete the trilogy (along with thesaurus and dictionary), you'll want the real magill.	2002-10-16

I was excited to see that one of the 19 books written about road rage actually purported to describe and explain patterns in the causes of road rage, rather than focusing exclusively on solutions and ways to avoid getting hurt. Instead, I got a fistful of neither.<br />The bulk of the book is a disorganized marginally frustrating ramble. Beyond a littany of colorful anecdotes, there is almost nothing compelling. The writing reads like a nut babbling in a park. The &quot;research&quot; ranges from arbitrary police interviews to the author's wife being frightened. The data, such as it is, is in shambles, and weakly offered even for what it is. The logic has holes the size of large trucks.<br />The entire production - content, style, layout, and organization - appears half-assed, even half-hearted. You *might*, if you're already eager to be worried about danger on the highways, keep flipping these pages, reading one anecdote after another and hoping to find something useful, something powerful, something important. But it simply isn't there.<br />And if you're already worreid about danger on the roads, pick any of the other books on the subject, several of which actually do provide intelligent, practical, well-thought summaries and suggestions. This one does not.	2002-09-18

The authors take few diversions - historical, rhetorical, or empirical - from describing the relations among the characters in the title: the credentialed Newton, the laborious Gray, and the intermediary Flamsteed. The result is a concise and enjoyable report on what is known and what can be reasonably surmised about the relative contributions of these men. There is sufficient detail (and sufficient lack of colouring) to make the book of interest to scientists, and to historians and sociologists of science. But there the book is sufficiently accessibile, and the subject matter sufficiently finite to make it equally appealing to anyone with interest in such topics as politics, organizations, and astronomy, not to mention Newton and his era.	2002-02-15

There is more nonfiction that interests me than I could read in five lifetimes, and even that assumes the best of circumstances - and a certain perspective on time.<br />But I could not resist something so preposterous as this book purported to be: thirty dreams, each detailing a distinct view of time. ...It would suffice to say simply that I read all thirty in under one hour and immediately read it again. But I should add that Lightman's vision and clarity are delightful, and that aspects of time (and of measurement, observation, and science generally) reappeared to me with a vibrancy I had not imagined.<br />I recommend this to anyone with an hour. Nay, an hour and a couch...It is, rather, a place to burrow and digest not the details or stopping points, but the shift and variability.<br />Don't read this to learn the thirty distinct views of time, and don't read the dreams scattered across days or more. Read it, all the way through at once, to feel your reality pulled, twisted, and reinvented. Feel Lightman's prose affect your own reading of the book (an insanely reflective effect!), such as when a dream of \\"sticky\\" time pulls you in and slower, or when a dream of stagnant time seems glossed with immobility.<br />A treasure!	2002-02-15

Except... Burnett should feel bad for missing the strengths of the first series' BOOK. Unlike the \\"Field Guide\\" to Survivor I, there's little interesting in the way of additional material or structural insight. If you're a Survivor fanatic, you may enjoy some banter about Australia's surivalist history and environment. If you need some toilet reading, you may enjoy the study cover and pretty pictures. If you're looking for something intelligent, exciting, and revealing, this ain't it.	2002-01-23

Over 100 ways of presenting data about the Internet, including fantastic advances in data collection AND analysis AND presentation. Beauty arises from every page.

Dean has some good insight here and there, and was the first to get a book about hte band off the ground. But this is really just one guy's take, its wrought with errors (typographical and grammatical, leave aside factual for now), and it's years and years old. There are a half dozen newer and more complete books, including the all-for-charity Phish Companion and the multi-volume Almanac.	2001-12-18

This is a clear and engaging introduction to the epistemology and model with which Black revolutionizes the discipline of sociology. It can be read and benefitted from in merely a few sittings, but is so intense and unique that it takes years to digest and appreciate fully. Anyone interested in sociology, in theory, in law, or in science should engage this work and reconsider much of what they think - about those topics, and about reality in general.

This would be the perfect gift for any Phish fan!<br />1,488 people spent 4 years writing a 928 page book that will generate $5,000 grants to charities working for music education. None of the writers earn a dime; all the money is given away.<br />It's twice the size of any other book about this band, has four times the information, and bests anything you'll find anywhere else, online or off. No garbage about other bands or the parking lots, just TONS of amazing information - everything you always wanted to know about Phish, and corrections to lots of stuff you thought you knew but didn't. Hey, they've even got new information on Phish's very first show!!<br />Plus, this book was done on an ALL VOLUNTEER basis and ALL FOR CHARITY. Whereas the Pharmer's Almanac folks [used] their initial material from online resources, in order to put profit in their pockets without having to work for it, the Phish Companion folks have put in thousands of hours, without wanting any kind of payment, to produce the highest quality book, and giving all their proceeds to music education for children.<br />There's really no choice: This book has more pages, more info, better info, better sources, lower price, more heart, and better karma. Encyclopedic? Absolutely - and a great bargain!	2000-11-27
