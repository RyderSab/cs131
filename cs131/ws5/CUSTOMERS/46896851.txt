US	46896851	R1BZ4D60PFAJTH	0771043503	578988346	Stephen Harper and the Future of Canada	Books	5	9	12	N	N	No Hidden Agenda	This is a well-written book, full of anecdotes and about an interesting subject. Many people claim that Stephen Harper has a &quot;hidden agenda&quot; but when reading about his life, it is easy to see a consistency in vision and a steadfast dedication to making Canada a better place for all Canadians, not just the political elite. Mr. Harper is brilliant and that comes out loud and clear in this unauthorized biography. Mr. Harper also is clearly a man with integrity and honesty. That greatest asset is also his biggest handicap, because Canadians are so used to the &quot;what's in it for me?&quot; style of politics that they have trouble understanding the integrity of Mr. Harper. I hope his critics will take the time to read this excellent book.	2005-07-10

Angeline and Stephen are cruelly betrayed and end up as slaves to those very same infidels. As Angeline and Stephen work to earn back their freedom, they learn to appreciate the culture, compassion and goodness of these people that they thought were their enemies.	2005-04-23

Set just before and during World War I, it is a first person narrative about a teen who leaves ethnic oppression and hardship of Ukraine only to find more of the same in Canada.<br />Fifteen year old Lesia and her older brother secretly save enough money to transport their family to Canada and away from the perpetual poverty of farming rented land even if their particular Polish landlord is kinder than most. When the teens have saved enough, they convince their parents to emigrate, but Lesia's grandmother refuses to go with them, preferring the status quo.<br />Canada is not the land of milk and honey that the advertisements promise, and Lesia's family find themselves on marginal scrub land with an abundance of mosquitoes. The family's fortune goes from bad to worse when World War I breaks out and Lesia's brother and father are interned as &quot;enemy aliens&quot;.<br />Langston is to be congratulated for writing a compelling novel on a shameful incident that our government has shoved under the carpet. While everyone knows about the internment of Japanese Canadians in WWII, few are aware of the fact that 8,000 Eastern European men, women and children were labelled &quot;enemy aliens&quot; and interned during WWI. About 5000 of those interned were Ukrainians who were mislabelled as &quot;Austrian&quot;, but Poles, Turks, Italians and Jews were also thrown into internment camps. In a nutshell, anyone the government didn't consider white enough was targeted. What is more remarkable is that Langston is not of Ukrainian heritage, and before embarking on this novel, she knew no one personally who had been interned.<br />Langston has researched her subject so thoroughly that the reader is plunged into compelling and realistic scenes set in Ukraine, the ship voyage across the ocean, and life in the wilds of Manitoba. The reader feels the stings of the summer mosquitoes and the bite of the vicious winter winds. The most vivid scenes of the novel take place during the winter in the wilds of Manitoba. While Lesia's father and brother are interned, Lesia, her little sister and pregnant mother must not only survive, but they must beat the clock and clear their land before the deed reverts back to the government. The core of this novel is told from Lesia's point of view as a young girl, but the story is framed with a narrative of Lesia in 2003: an old woman, telling her great-granddaughter about her experiences.nter winds.

I basically devoured her two short story collections, Glory Days, and Golden Girl, so when I saw that she had written a novel, I picked it up.<br />From the very first page, I was swept into the story. My own beloved dog had died just a week before I read this novel, and so the character of Dog especially appealed to me. It is not easy to fully develop an animal character in a realistic novel, but Chan achieves this admirably. I had tears in my eyes as I read it. Dog was so \\"real\\" that I could almost pat him!<br />And the historical research! As a historical novelist myself, I am very picky when I read other historicals, but this one is spot-on. Bravo!<br />I also loved the touch of fantasy.<br />The Carved Box is a universal tale that transcends age limits.	2002-05-06

I did know that my father was born in the prairies, and I'd heard stories about my grandfather escaping serfdom in the old country only to be unjustly imprisoned once he came to Canada.<br />As a young adult, I searched vainly for books that would tell me a bit about my ancestry, but the closest I could get was to read books that skirted around Ukrainian history: those written by Polish, Jewish, Russian and German authors. All I could find about Ukrainian Canadians dealt with food, embroidery, dance. Not history.<br />The first fragment of light on this topic was a newspaper article printed in the mid-1980s in the Globe &amp; Mail. This op-ed piece was written by Professor Lubomyr Luciuk and it detailed the fact that 8,000 Eastern European Canadians (5,000 of whom were Ukrainian Canadians) had been interned during World War I as &quot;enemy aliens&quot;. I had never heard of such a thing. The Japanese in World War II, yes. But Ukrainians? I asked by father if he had ever heard of such an incident, and he looked at me sternly and said, &quot;Of course I have. How many times have I told you about how your grandfather was imprisoned unjustly?&quot;<br />What a revelation. This professor was writing about my own history. I went to the library and found that this Professor Luciuk had written a number of books, all dealing with aspects of Ukrainian Canadian history and geography. I checked them out and read them. And then I wrote Silver Threads, a folk tale loosely based on my grandfather's internment experience.<br />I didn't really feel that I was qualified to write such a book. What if I got the history wrong? So I got up my nerve and tracked down Professor Luciuk's phone number. I left a message on his answering machine, and a few weeks later, he called me. When I told him what I had done, he agreed to read the story. I mailed it to him, and he corrected the history.<br />Silver Threads is now taught in schools across Canada, and the internment of Ukrainians is a well-known fact, but if it hadn't been for Professor Luciuk's research, this small but significant fragment of Canadian history would have been lost.<br />Searching for Place is filled with such gems. For example, how many Canadians of Ukrainian descent realize that they are not one homogenous group? The first, second and third waves are as different as different can be: in politics, geographic origin, and religion.<br />In the 1930s, while Canada suffered from the Depression, many Canadians of Ukrainian descent were sympathetic Communism. Across the ocean, their compatriots were being killed en masse by that very same ideology. When political refugees fleeing Communism came to Canada and met up with those whom they had assumed would be sympathetic, friction was inevitable.<br />Similarly, how many Canadians of Ukrainian descent realize just how hostile Canada was to their arrival? Myth has it that these early settlers in their sheepskin coats were welcomed with open arms as they covered the prairies with wheat fields and train tracks. But Professor Luciuk's book points out the dismay government officials felt when they realized that these immigrants did not easily forget their origins. They tended to settle all together and speak only Ukrainian. In the government's mind, a &quot;good Canadian&quot; was one who would change his unpronounceable name to something simpler, marry an Englishwoman, be content to farm, and above all, forget his homeland.<br />This book will be of interest to all Canadians who would like to know more about why Ukrainians came to Canada and what is was they were forced to abandon. While the first and second immigration waves are covered, the third wave, which happened after World War II, is given special emphasis. Life in the DP camps is an intriguing chapter, as is the chapter dealing with shock and horrorof Ukrainian Canadian soldiers in World War II who meet Ukrainian displaced persons.<br />I found it fascinating to read about the origins of the Ukrainian Canadian Congress: a &quot;surgical intervention&quot; on the part of the Canadian government, who forcibly took property away from one faction of Ukrainian Canadians and handed it over to another.<br />The most intriguing part of this book has to be the end notes, which make up more than half the whole book. I found myself reading Searching for Place with two bookmarks on the go: one for the chapters and the other for the inside story contained in the notes. I recommend this book highly.r of Ukrainian Canadian soldiers in World War II who meet Ukrainian displaced persons.<br />I found it fascinating to read about the origins of the Ukrainian Canadian Congress: a &quot;surgical intervention&quot; on the part of the Canadian government, who forcibly took property away from one faction of Ukrainian Canadians and handed it over to another.<br />The most intriguing part of this book has to be the end notes, which make up more than half the whole book.
