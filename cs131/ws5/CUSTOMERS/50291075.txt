This is horror either at its worst or at it's best.  <br />If you are looking for mean (undeveloped) characters, lots of gore, hideous crimes, cheating, murder, good cops, more gore, an 'overwhelmingly' impossible ending, drugs, constant sexual references, and obviously, the person you least expect is the killer...  why of course....  Then this IS the book or you...  <br />IF however you want a story with some meat, some characters you care about if the die, some suspense, some spine tingles and all that other great stuff then stay well away. <br />This book can be read in a few hours as it is so short and the complete book is dialogue based.  I wanted something to read on a plane and this fitted the bill as it requires next to no concentration to keep up.  This book does flow quite well, but at times the plot and the dialogue was laughable, and I doubt that was the point.	2001-03-18

At the end of the day only James Herbert comes close to the pedestal owned by Stephen King.  <br />The greatest James Herbert book is the Fog, followed closely by Rats, Lair and Domain.  \\"Others\\" demonstrates Herbert's consistency to develop a great character and to deliver some stunning, gut churning and electrifying horror.  It is not one of his classics, but it is very well written and certainly worth the effort.  The Nic Dismas Character probably is one of his best, but the final pages lacked something that was so evident in his earlier work.	2001-03-14

The build up of the story was very well put together, but at the end I did have to wonder what all the fuss was about.  The final 3rd of the book when the focus was on Walt as an adult was such a huge switch from the first half that it was difficult to adjust to and keep up with.  In the same respect the concept of this book is so &quot;out there&quot; that the pages keep on turning...  It certianly is worth reading, but you have to concentrate.	2001-03-09

This book broadcasts his same humor, but I felt it was missing something.  The manner in which the whole book unfolds during one night in London is well done, and I found the ending exciting, and well written.  But this book lost something in the middle, it became a touch boring, and the jokes had been used to many times before.  <br />With all that said however, I feel that Ben Elton remains the master of comedy writing, his books, TV shows and Stand Up routines are a cut above everybody else.	2001-01-18

They are a great partner to travel with by plane or train to the family's house for turkey and plumb pudding.  Out of all the stories, the one which gave me the most laughs was the final story &quot;Christmas Means Giving&quot; which shows just how far competition between neighbors 'could' go.

The Water Method Man does not come out the magical cauldron that John Irwing used to concoct The World According to Garp and A Prayer for Owen Meany, but it is still a great read, written with the same passion and humor as his classics.<br />Being much shorter than his other books, this maybe lacks depth, but the characters are very colorful, and the constant leaps through time are very well worked.  John Irwing has such talent when it comes to turning ordinary people into unique and intriguing characters that stumble though the most imaginative situations.	2001-01-02

At one point Aster takes this book to the extreme ends of imagination by taking our Canine Hero Mr. Bones into a vivid hallucination where he imagines himself as a housefly.  To many this could be a bit much, but it is a refreshingly simple idea that makes for light hearted reading.

This is the sort of book you should throw in the bottom of your carry on bag as you head off on a trip, it is great reading on a plane, in an airport, on a bus, on a beach or by a pool.  It flows along really well, and it is easy to keep track of what is going on.  The drama maintains a adequate and believable pace, and you have to love our heroine, she comes across as a young mans dream; I ended up feeling her pain, and I was cheering when things went well.  For a student she stumbled across too much, and maybe that is not realistic, but this is fiction, so what does it matter!	2000-11-20

Before I let rip, I didn't read Silence of the Lambs, Or Red Dragon, I saw the Movie years back, loved it, waited for the next book, and hoped for a sequel that would be a good read that would go well on the silver screen.  When I got to the end of this book this morning, I said \\"Thank God..  I made it to the end\\".  Did the editor forget to leave out the drivel?  <br />The Dr. Lector character maintains his depth and passion, which is why this gets two stars and not one, but this was relied upon much to heavily.  Their is an element of tension, but it staggered towards it like a whining child in a supermarket, and when it finally made it, it was a relief and no real surprise.  Stephen King remains the master of suspense and horror.<br />The final insult came with the books conclusion, I personally found it poor, an insult to Starlings character, and much too difficult to believe.  <br />I had the image of Anthony Hopkins throughout the book, and he will bring color to the part, but with a book like this to base a film upon, there will be no need to write an acceptance speech this time.	2000-11-05

The Catcher in the Rye and perhaps One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest are perhaps two.<br />For centuries brothers have murdered brothers in the pursuit of peace, and although we always 'try' to believe in the powers pulling the strings we never stand up and ask why?.  Jospeh Heller used Yossarian to ask why, and he uses a wit to make the point so incredibly poignant.  <br />If passers by catch you reading Catch 22 many pass a knowing gaze and quite possibly feel a tingle down their spine.  Whilst at an Airport in Texas a gentleman spotted the book and made a comment that was positively chilling:  &quot;I read this book and laughed in college, and then read it a second time in Vietnam.  The second time it was not as funny, the second time it was true.&quot;<br />Before reading Catch 22 I read an interview with Joseph Heller, he was asked why he had never written another book as great as Catch 22, his reply was simple: &quot;Nobody Has&quot;.  When you reach the end you have to agree.	2000-09-30

Kinky has a wonderful habit of  making the extraordinary seem very ordinary, and he gives the ordinary an  added twist of the extraordinary.  This book is really harmless, and it is  an easy read.

Both are provided, but they where so cleverly included that they did not  interfere with the shocks, stuns, laughs and drama of the book.  I had my  own ideas on who would die, and I (like many others) was way out.  Ooh  well...<br />Once again the new characters where just incredible, and the  existing characters held their own and got more impressive.  Mad Eye Moody  is probably the best character yet to show up and he was just phenominal...  I have to say the chapter when harry takes a bath and gets stuck in the  stairs is with out doubt the best chapter from any of the four books.<br />Now we have to look forward and ask questions about book 5...  the  ending of the Goblet of Fire leaves so many doors open, but we can rest  assured that we will find more surprises, thrills and spills.<br />As a side  not, on a recent trip to England I picked up the English release and was  disappointed about how poorly it was presented, could you imagine Harry  Potter without Mary Grandpre !	2000-08-07

Like the  Catcher in the Rye, One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest and Zen and the Art of  Motorcycle Maintenance, Flowers for Algenon is a modern classic that  challenges opinion and turns over the stones of controversy.<br />After the  first few pages this book pulls the emotional cords and tugs your  conscience in all directions.

This was a decent tale filled with different motivations.  I felt the concept was a  bit lame, so it was difficult to keep it interesting.

Again	Right of the Bat, I don't rate this book as highly as &quot;The World According to Garp&quot; or a \\"Prayer for Owen Meany&quot; but lets face it, no other two books are ever going to be &quot;that&quot; good.  <br />This  story is just so incredible, and it does manage to capture the magic of  Irwings other classics, I for one love his continued obsession with Bears  and Vienna, and I pity people who feel he is being narrow.  His imagination  for an off the wall eccentric sorry is just phenomenal.  I think this book  started well, it lost something in the middle with the early years in  Vienna, but the end was wonderful, and so typically heart wrenching.   Finally, John Irwings stands alone in development of colorful characters;  right now the world is obsessed (and rightly so) with the wave known as  Harry Potter, but I feel even JK Rowlings has a distance to go before she  achieves what Irwing achieves with his characters...  Here we have  prostitutes, quarterbacks, writers, terrorists, an elusive man in a white  jacket, midgets, and not forgetting a talking bear... what could be better?	2000-06-11

I have a very biased opinion on Stephen King; I have enjoyed all of his work; and The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is great work.  In general I think SK has a wonderful ability of writing such different tales, whilst managing  to introduce interesting characters, and presenting some chilling horror.  In this book King has continued his mold of the late 90's by delivering a  unique book that is different from any of his other work.  Very few writers  could write a whole book about a young girl lost in the woods, fewer could  keep it interesting for 250 pages and only Stephen King could leave you at  the end wanting more.  This book could have been twice as long, but come to  think of it, so could The Stand!.  Long Live the King.	2000-05-18

Wally Lamb has brought us another novel about a tragic character that our hearts run away with.  A wonderful book, that twists and turns between past and present, good and  evil.  <br />But...  and there is a but.  Like Dolores Price in She's Come  Undone, Dominick is an unfortunate hero.  Both characters seem to get  themselves into ridiculous circumstances and with both characters I have  wanted to tell them both to grow up and stop being so arrogant.  Is Wally  Lamb trying (and failing) to craft a Garp or a Owen Meany?.  Whatever the  case, neither character comes close to supplying the heart wrench of our  literary angel &quot;Owen Meany&quot;.  <br />I think I wanted more from this  book than it was ever going to provide, but it still kept me intrigued.  This book is certainly worth the effort it takes to read 900 pages, and it  packs a great punch and numerous surprises.  The ending is well developed,  if not a little perfect and the flash backs between near and distant past  are very well combined, and for that reason &quot;I Know This Much is  True&quot; goes down as a classic.	2000-05-13

Firstly, I  feel inclined to mention though that I feel a touch distressed that in 90% of reviews for this work I have read there is always a mention of the work by  John Irwing.  Numerous comparisons have been written regarding Dolores  Price as the next T.S Garp, and many reviews rate She's Come Undone as a  tale that matches Owen Meany.  Wally Lamb has crafted a superb novel, but  this book is not in the league of Owen Meany and Garp.  For his first novel  Wally Lamb  has done a tremendous job, and he is well on the way to  matching Irwings classics, but he is not their just yet.  <br />The way Wally  lamb has created all of the characters is amazing. Although on so many  occasions you want to tell Dolores to get a life and open her eyes your  heart goes out to her and attaches to the cruelty she has  habit of  stumbling into.   The sub-characters are equally well developed, some (like  Rita) remain quite illusive, when others (like Dante &amp; Roberta) provide  the book with so much life and enrichment.  <br />A truly wonderful book,  worth all five stars, roll on Wally.	2000-03-13

The Hallucinations began by being a bit too intense, but plot develops and the character evolution is brilliantly done.  The story flows, twists, turns,  and leads you down an immensely psychological journey.   The main  characters where awesome, and the ending is just chilling.  Although each  strand of the story is cunningly woven and brought to a conclusion, the  book asks more questions than it ever hoped to answer, and certainly that  is the purpose of art.  If not for the wild hallucinations it would have  been a five star classic.	2000-03-06
