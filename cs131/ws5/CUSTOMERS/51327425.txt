This was such a good book that I read it twice in a month, which I don't think I've ever done before.<br /><br />To the natural question - why did he want to walk across Afghanistan? - Stewart's best answer is that he had walked across most of Asia but had been unable to complete the Afghanistan link as originally planned.  There are no better answers, and Stewart doesn't pretend to provide them.  The second question - why do this in winter? - is presented as a matter of convenience, since that's when he happened to be in Herat.<br /><br />As these illustrations might suggest, Stewart's writing is admirably sparse.  By seeming to report just facts, he constructs a wonderful narrative in which many things are unsaid (but implied).  He is simple and direct.<br /><br />Afghani politics and the coalition invasion lie in the background to this walk and sometimes affect the story.  For the most part, however, this is a story of a fragmented society in a very poor, war-devastated country.  However, each village differs from its neighbors, and these differences make up a fascinating part of the book.<br /><br />Afghanistan is also a very traditional Islamic society, and this too affects Stewart's experiences.  Again, there is considerable variation.  When he arrives in a remote formerly Mongol region with \\"notorious\\" attitudes toward the sexes, he sits and speaks with women for the first time.<br /><br />For the role of women in Afghanistan, I strongly recommend \\"The Bookseller of Kabul.\\"  The two books go well together.  Each author is an excellent observer, one of urban Afghanistan, the other of rural Afghanistan.	2005-09-23

Literally everything that you might want to know about pronghorns is here.  And then some.  For example, the chapter on hunting not only tells you how to clean a pronghorn but provides a few recipes (tastes like veal).  The two lead authors are at the end of their careers and have collected two lifetimes of learning in this book.<br /><br />Reflecting all that knowledge, many of the chapters read like laundry lists of the scholarly literature.  That makes it an essential reference but many chapters are a pretty dry read.<br /><br />The authors haven't done enough sifting through the material, weighing its strengths and weaknesses.  We never get a manifesto for future research on, say, the parasitology or anatomy of the pronghorn.  This would help liven up the book.<br /><br />This lack of synthesis or manifesto probably reflects the fact that O'Gara and/or Yoakum are the author or co-author of almost every chapter.  Knowledgeable as they are, they can't be the leading experts on every single aspect of the pronghorn.  The book would have been better served by a greater range of contributors.  An excellent model of this, and a comparably exhaustive book that covers its animal better, is Mech and Boitano's \\"Wolves: Behavior, Ecology, and Conservation.\\"<br /><br />The authors display their own voice most strongly in those chapters on in management issues: fencing and habitat fragmentation, capture and relocation, and hunting.  The authors have strong views on how to do these things and how to do them right.  These chapters are also the most lively written and the easiest to read.<br /><br />Even on those policy issues, O'Gara and Yoakum take the perspective of managers working within existing legal and political frameworks.  From this bottom-up perspective, their best suggestions often rest on maintaining good relations among stakeholders such as hunters, landowners, and the public.  It would be particularly valuable if these authors could step \\"outside the box\\" at the end and think about how they might change that regulatory environment in an ideal world.  Do interspersed holdings of private land and BLM leases serve ranchers, hunters, and the animals best?  Or would land swaps that consolidate private land and convert BLM land to wildlife refuges serve better?  (Presumably the answer to that question depends on the share of public land in a state, since Wyoming and Nevada are not Nebraska or California.)<br /><br />These authors prefer to avoid bolder steps and claims.  Again, this differs dramatically from the community of wolf researchers.  Essential as this book is as a desk reference for those interested in this animal, it could have been better.if these authors could step \\"outside the box\\" at the end and think about how they might change that regulatory environment in an ideal world.

(Who knew that there were chain stores in Afghanistan?)  Because of his love of books, he's done some courageous things in his life and served some time in prison for it.<br /><br />However, the book is not really about Khan but about several members of his family, especially the women.  Though, as the patriarch Khan shapes everything that goes on in the family, he seems unaware of what shapes him.<br /><br />Khan is a tragic figure: he thinks of himself as a freethinker but he is trapped by the social roles in which he was born, and he can't rethink those.  Instead, he reproduces the deeply authoritarian and misogynistic patterns of his parents, and presumably those of many generations of Afghan families.<br /><br />Khan's sons resent him, but it's clear they will rule their own families the same way.  Any man who refers to defer absolutely to the patriarch is cut down or cut off.  The sons mostly learn this lesson well.<br /><br />Miserable as it would be to be Khan's son, the women clearly suffer the most.  Some women succeed in making a space for women to be together, and to be themselves in that environment.  Most are trapped, and the youngest are essentially household slaves.<br /><br />There are glimmers of change in urban Kabul, such as men who want to know about other societies, or women who want to be teachers because of the greater independence the profession would give them.  Nonetheless, the obstacles loom large.  To understand how difficult it is to change traditional societies-not just Afghanistan--I strongly recommend this book.<br /><br />I also strongly recommend Rory Stewart, The Places in Between, which is the account of a traveler through rural areas in post-Taliban Afghanistan.  I bought it in Europe but it apparently isn't yet available new in North America, though some used book sellers seem to have it.  Keep an eye out for it.	2005-09-23
US	51327425	R3KG5EVCAN3CZ	0425178951	788292440	Deep South (An Anna Pigeon Novel)	Books	5	3	3	N	N	One of the better books in the Anna Pigeon series	\\"Deep South\\" and \\"Hunting Season\\" are both set in Natchez Trace National Parkway.  This is one of those units of the National Park system that nobody ever thinks of, but it takes up a 450-miles stretch from southwestern border of Mississippi through the northeastern border and up to Nashville.  Because it's a strip of parkway, it is far more a part of the community than many other national parks.<br /><br />As a result, the fact that Anna is a \\"ranger\\" in a \\"national park\\" seems beside the point in this book.  She is a Yankee law enforcement officer who finds herself in an unfamiliar world.  Some of this world consists of Yankee stereotypes of the South: good old boys, racists, pickup trucks and football.  Other characters emerge as real people.<br /><br />Anna arrived in this park with a promotion to management.  Her introduction to management is a nightmare; one of her two rangers is a real nightmare, a lazy, sexist, hostile, lawsuit-prone loser.  His forms of resistance are so well drawn that they must be based on some people in Nevada Barr's own past as a ranger.<br /><br />The murder victim is a high school student on prom night.  As a result, much of the plot involves talking to the victim's friends.  Ranger Pigeon, like Nevada Barr, has no kids.  The world of high school is therefore mystifying to Ranger Pigeon - and to Nevada Barr.  As a result, some parts of the school world are not drawn very convincingly.<br /><br />The ending of this book left me cold, with a number of loose ends summarized very drily.  It reminded me of those movies with text at the end saying things like, \\"Joe ended up as a real estate agent in Wichita, while Mary went back to college in Texas.\\"  Stretching this out a little would have left me with a more satisfied feeling at the end.<br /><br />That said, this is a good entry in the Anna Pigeon series, even one of the better ones.  If you have enjoyed any of the other books in the series, you certainly want to read this one.<br />	2005-09-12

She is a ranger in Guadeloupe Mountains National Park and comes across the body of a ranger who has apparently been killed by a cougar (hence the name of the book).  She is convinced that the lion has been wrongfully accused of murder, and this conviction grows stronger as more dead bodies appear.  Since an autopsy of the ranger shows that she was killed by the cougar, you know from the start that Barr has come up with an good setup for a murder mystery, with a novel choice of weapon.<br /><br />Ranger Anna Pigeon is an interesting character, with a backstory (she is a widow who escapes New York by becoming a ranger), a long-distance relationship with her psychiatrist sister (a plot device that serves well to reveal inner thoughts), and a vice (alcoholism).  She's cynical and worldly, but that is balanced by her love of nature and the parks.  She's also a bit of a superhero, especially at the end, and I don't find those parts too convincing.<br /><br />The book conveys a great sense of the setting.  Barr loves the desert parks, including the site of this novel, Guadeloupe Mountains (in West Texas).  This is a relatively unknown park, which includes the high point of Texas.  Ranger Pigeon spends a lot of time in the backcountry of the park and makes it sound inviting even though there are no water sources there.<br /><br />The book has a well-constructed plot though the ending lacks a full resolution.  As is generally true in this series, it's easier to make good guesses about whodunnit than it is to figure out the motive.  Some motives are so oddball, \\"out of the box,\\" that I don't see how you could figure it out from the information given, and that's a violation of the mystery writers' code.  Barr *almost* commits that sin here.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good introduction to the series.  If you don't like this one, don't read any of the others.	2005-08-23

The book focuses on both office politics in the company he works for and on West's romantic life in France.<br /><br />The people around him are an interesting cast of characters.  Both the people and various events clearly reflect some of Clarke's own experiences in France, exaggerated and otherwise fictionalized of course.  Some reflect English stereotypes of the French, and some events and people are more unpredictable<br /><br />The book is really, really funny.  It's fairly risque in places, so if you have a problem with that you have been warned.  Clarke clearly has a very active fantasy life, and some of that has showed up in the book.  Judging by his alter ego, he also has quite an ego himself and can be a bit insufferable.<br /><br />For a more serious treatment of how the French are different, try \\"Sixty Million Frenchmen Can't Be Wrong: Why We Love France but Not the French,\\" by Jean-Benoit Nadeau and Julie Barlow.  Better still, read them both.	2005-08-18

Nie discusses the management of wild populations in Alaska and the upper Midwest as well as wolf reintroduction programs in Idaho and Yellowstone.  He is primarily interested in wolf management policy.  Though he is a professor, Nie avoids scholarly theory and jargon.  He writes well and the book reads easily.<br /><br />Nie has a background in both resource management and political science, so he's well positioned to talk about the human side of wolves.  As a result of being more attuned to the social sciences, he provides a more insightful account of the human side of the wolf-human relationship than your typical biologist - or even your atypical biologist.  This is really the best book available on the political social side of wolf management.  However, it's not quite as reader-friendly as Steinhardt's book.<br /><br />Nie considers a series of relevant issues: the symbolic issues of wolves and ranchers, the political economy of wolf regions, the politics of wildlife management organizations, and the successes and failures of stakeholder-based management such as the Fortymile caribou herd in Alaska and the Yukon.  He emphasizes the conflicts in values between wolf supporters and opponents, and is sympathetic to solutions that bring interested parties into dialogue with one another.<br /><br />The result is a very measured and moderate book.  I can imagine fanatic anti-wolf people hating this book, but if you are a wolf lover who can't accept the idea of shooting wolves under any circumstances, you'll probably dislike his approach as well.<br /><br />I would have liked to see him broaden his subject a bit.  The book concentrates on the US, though Canada (and to a much lesser extent) Mexico are also discussed.  It would be interesting to learn more about wolf management issues in Europe and Asia.  For that, the best source is Mech and Boitani.	2005-08-10

One of the conventions of the mystery genre is that the author tries to misdirect the reader, but of course readers know this and take it into account when trying to figure out whodunnit.  This book has two good misdirections, which seem that they may or may not be connected.  Meanwhile the villain lurked under my radar screen, though in hindsight there were a few minor clues.<br /><br />You should be warned that this book has a very nasty villain and very nasty crimes.  If you are disturbed by things (which I won't describe), this book will disturb you.  You can tell from the book jacket that it begins with two apparently-abused twelve-year-olds reappearing after being lost in the woods for weeks.  I will say only that the villain and the motive are *more* disturbing than you might surmise from those facts.<br /><br />Compared with other Barr books, this one has a much weaker sense of place.  The story could have taken place in any mountainous region with trails.  Unlike other books, I didn't really learn anything about the subject park (Rocky Mountain NP).  In these respects, \\"Hard Truth\\" resembles \\"Firestorm,\\" which could have taken place anywhere in the west with wildfires.  The book does not display the love of place evident in Barr's western desert or southern novels.<br /><br />Characterization is a mixed bag here.  There is a very scary villain, who is well-characterized when revealed.  Another character, and possible suspect, is really just a combination of stereotypes.  A third character, and another possible suspect, remains mostly stereotyped but off-stage.  In contrast, there is a wheelchair-bound character who is sketched convincingly but not entirely pleasantly.  Several park employees are developed well enough to provide the essential backdrop but not well enough to emerge as strong characters.  There are also some interesting women characters who are not characterized as fully as I would have like -- especially in terms of the end of the novel -- but they became more intriguing as the story went along.<br /><br />Once again, Barr has given us an ending straight out of an action-adventure movie.  I for one would like to see Anna Pigeon just arrest somebody in their home sometime, with adequate backup available.  Instead, Barr prefers these unbelievable endings, which include some well-nigh miraculous survivals.  This one is even more frustrating because Barr drags it out across three locations before giving us a deus-ex-machina resolution.  On the good side, this particular deus ex machina was satisfying.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say this one is about in the middle of Barr's books in terms of quality, neither among the best nor the worst.  But the real question for a potential reader is how you feel about a very disturbing (dark) turn.e like -- especially in terms of the end of the novel -- but they became more intriguing as the story went along. <br /> <br />Once again, Barr has given us an ending straight out of an action-adventure movie.

The battlefield is also a good illustration of the challenges of battlefield preservation, since large parts of it are preserved while other parts are buried underneath urban and suburban sprawl.  A good history and a good battlefield guide would be welcome.<br /><br />Unfortunately, \\"No Better Place to Die\\" is not that book.  In fact, I'd say that it's really more of an example of how *not* to write military history.  Almost all of the book is a descriptive, blow by blow account of the battle, often at the regimental and brigade level.  This means that Cozzens does not provide a sufficiently frequent birds-eye view of the battle to supplement the action on the ground and to explain the choices people were making.  His prose style is also pretty dry, though quotations from diaries help liven it up considerably.<br /><br />The book also does not have enough maps.  Especially in a blow-by-blow book, an abundance of well-designed maps showing the action are essential and would really help tell the story.<br /><br />Despite its weaknesses, I managed to read the book to the end, largely because I was in Murfreesboro at the time.  If you are physically there, the first chapter is good for setting the stage.  In fact, Cozzens would have done better to write the other chapters more like the first.  Moreover, if you are in town, you can get a sense of the battlefield without maps (and you'll have the park service maps after all).  The book is also helpful because you will meet some characters whose monuments you might see around town.<br /><br />I haven't read any of the other books available on the battle, so it may be true (as some other reviewers claim) that this one is the best available.  But you'll probably note that most of the reviewers talk about the battle, not the book.  It's a disappointment.	2005-08-04

Nash wrote the first version in the 1960s, originally as his dissertation.  The main narrative has held up well.  Nash has also put the text through regular revisions, so it lacks any embarrassingly outdated claims that might detract from the book.<br /><br />The first part of the book is an intellectual history of \\"wilderness.\\"  Wilderness may exist as a state of mind or as the product of an intellectual movement (as in Nash).  This kind of analysis is invariably subjective and selective.  Nash, like others engaged in this kind of history, draws from a subset of all the people who wrote on the topic at a given moment (and, as he recognizes, necessarily leaves out the views of people who don't write them down).  Then, like others, he organizes this material, calling it a \\"Romantic\\" view of wilderness or whatever.<br /><br />I find such exercises interesting but generally unpersuasive by their very nature.  For example, Nash interprets the Bible and other foundational texts for Western civilization as embodying a \\"subdue the wilderness\\" ethos.  Fine.  But what of Jesus' reference to the \\"lilies of the field\\"?  Certainly that implies a valuation of nature as beautiful and worthy in itself - - \\"Romantic,\\" perhaps.  My point is that anyone can always do this, and any intellectual history can always be criticized for leaving things out and thus mischaracterizing what it discusses.<br /><br />That said, Nash is not too objectionable on that front.  In fact, his categorization is helpful, and would be especially good as an introduction to these ideas.  This is doubtless why this book is used in so many undergraduate ecology courses.<br /><br />The second part of the book focuses on various battles over wilderness.  Here he moves closer to a straight history.  His narrative is forceful and engrossing.<br /><br />The last chapter, on international issues, is really too superficial to be useful.  It leaves the impression that he is trying to be complete with each new edition, without really having fresh insights into the subject.<br /><br />Overall, the book is very well-written and easy to read - - I classify it as the kind of book that is good to read on an airplane (which is in fact where I read it).oo superficial to be useful.

This is easily the best book I've read on any animal, though some books on wolves come close.  Given the totemic role of the bison in American culture and history, it's an important book as well.<br /><br />I'm not particularly interested in bison, and used to see them as dumb cow-like animals you see everywhere in Yellowstone.  I now have much greater respect for the animal.  I've also learned the answers to burning questions such as \\"why, if they are both prairie grazers, are pronghorns (usually) territorial while bison are not?\\"<br /><br />Lott likes to tell stories as a way to present natural history.  This strategy is very effective. He is a professor emeritus of natural history but wears his learning lightly, in part because of these stories.<br /><br />Lott is also uniquely qualified to write this book.  He grew up on the national bison range, so he has been around these animals all his life.  It's easy to imagine walking the prairie with Lott, listening to his stories about bison.  He tells stories and explains nature as well as Bernd Heinrich, though Lott is less quirky (which could be either a good thing or a bad thing).<br /><br />Though the book is short, it's pretty exhaustive in its coverage of the bison.  He covers habitat, behavior, some other animals in the ecosystem (badgers, coyotes, black-footed ferrets, prairie dogs), relations with humans, and conservation issues.<br /><br />I don't normally praise a book's production values, but kudos to the University of California Press for making a beautiful trade paperback.  You can get a sense of this from the cover picture here at Amazon.  The layout and organization, the photographic plates in the middle of the book, and the pictures at the head of each part (group of chapters) look great.  It's a pleasure to hold in your hands as you read it.<br /><br />The book makes an argument for a large grasslands park, probably in conjunction with Canada's Grasslands NP.  This argumentation isn't particularly effective, though.  If you're inclined to favor such an idea, Lott will have an emotional appeal to you.  If you're opposed, you won't get any hard-nosed arguments that will try to persuade you to change your mind.  (In either case, I would recommend Manning's \\"Grassland\\" as making a more powerful case for such a park.)<br /><br />Anyway, check out all the other reviews.

It was wonderful to read as well as haunting me for days afterward.<br /><br />The \\"rez\\" of the title is the Pine Ridge Reservation of the Oglala Sioux.  The book deals with the Oglala Sioux both on the rez and in scattered other places, as far away as New York and New Jersey.  He includes some history and \\"historical\\" characters up through Russell Means and Dennis Banks.<br /><br />There are two stars in the book: his friend Le War Lance, and the basketball star SuAnne Big Crow.  Le is a lovable ne'er-do-well who serves as Frazier's (and our) guide to the Sioux and to Pine Ridge.  Big Crow, whom Frazier never met, serves as a background hero and her story an unfolding tragedy.<br /><br />More than anything, the book is about people and not about having any ideological axe to grind.  Many of his acquaintances are alcoholics and/or unemployed.  Frazier acknowledges what most people would call both \\"social forces\\" and \\"individual responsibility\\" in explaining these cliched problems.  He also sees the \\"nobility\\" and \\"sense of freedom\\" that represent more positive cliches, but again he doesn't overemphasize them.  In short, he neither whitewashes nor praises effusively, but he is at root simply interested in the experiences of the Oglala people both on and off the reservation.  Frazier loves his friends on the reservation but finds some of them frustrating.<br /><br />Some people might not like the results.  For example, many of Frazier's acquaintances hit him up for money; as a result, he always loads up on twenties before visiting Pine Ridge.  You might think this is a degrading detail, you might think that Frazier is a smug white man who wants everyone to know of his generosity, or perhaps you'd want him to turn down these requests so as not to compromise a writer's relationship with his subjects.  Take your pick.  But Frazier's matter-of-fact writing style lets you make up your own mind about him as well as his subjects.<br /><br />For all its interest, this remains a book written by a white observer; if you'd like an excellent account of Pine Ridge by an insider, read Mary Crow Dog's \\"Lakota Woman.\\"<br /><br />Frazier is an very good observer of both detail and personality.  Given the rich diversity of any community of people such as Pine Ridge, you feel as if you are riding along in his car, looking over his shoulder.  Very highly recommended as a slice of America.this remains a book written by a white observer; if you'd like an excellent account of Pine Ridge by an insider, read Mary Crow Dog's \\"Lakota Woman.\\"    Frazier is an very good observer of both detail and personality.

One sidebar on the Supreme Court, for example, compares justices' relationships to gorillas' dominance displays, notes that Supreme Court justices are descended from apes, and includes a well-chosen picture of a gorilla making a face.  Oh, did I mention that there's a serious point hidden in that sidebar too?<br /><br />Funny as it is, the book is also unnecessarily vulgar on every page.  I wish the writers understood that the f-word is not by itself funny; moreover, on those occasions when it *is* funny, it is funnier when sparely used.  Bad taste is also not funny by itself, such as the book's full-frontal nude dress-up dolls of Supreme Court justices.  (OK, it's mildly amusing that Rehnquist has no member, but that's the only joke on the two-page spread.)<br /><br />So, it might be hard to assign this to your high-school civics class without provoking an attack from prudish parents -- which is too bad, because I think the kids would actually learn something about American politics from this book.	2005-07-08
US	51327425	R2Q07652PRLH90	039915258X	346813546	Bushworld	Books	4	10	14	N	N	Recommended for Left and Right	I don't normally like the vitriolic political writers, whether Ann Coulter or Michael Moore.  I'm happy to report that Dowd's book isn't like that.  She's plenty critical of Bush, of course, but more sarcastic than vitriolic.  Sarcasm, like irony, requires more thought than name-calling.  I like that.<br /><br />The book is a collection of Dowd's columns, loosely organized thematically.  With over 500 pages, and each column three pages long, allowing for filler material there must be 150 or so columns here.  It's hard to read this many columns straight through.<br /><br />Given this length, the book needed a stronger editorial hand.  I would have been tempted to break it into two smaller books, since it's hard to read a lot of columns one after the other.<br /><br />Editorial content would also have been helpful - - perhaps some introductory text before each section to remind us of the context of each column.  The columns are very much \\"of the moment\\" and assume that you've been reading the newspaper the last few days.  That can be a bit frustrating in a book format, since we might not exactly remember the big news item of the week of March 18, 2000.  At the same time, it's interesting to relive history and to see what people were talking about two years ago without our benefit of hindsight.<br /><br />The book is full of good one-liners.  She doesn't try for reasoned argument, but has a real gift for pointing out absurdities.  Though she is clearly toward the left end of the political spectrum, Dowd remains personally fond of Bush Sr and likes Reagan despite herself.  That makes her deep dislike of Bush Jr all the more remarkable - - she can't find a single nice thing to say about him.	2005-07-08

At the time of his writing, this was the only such biography in English.  This still seems to be true.<br /><br />Henderson's book is much more readable than most traditional biographies, and it is even a page-turner at times.  He provides good coverage of Eugen's character, and gives significant attention to his interests in architecture, art, and bibliophilia.  As you might expect from a book written in the 1960s, Henderson dances around Eugen's apparent homosexuality but provides enough facts for your own evaluation.<br /><br />The book's major weakness is that it lacks any explanation of Eugen's military successes. Since Henderson is not a military professional, he shied away from any analysis, and the battles mostly rest on Eugen's \\"brilliance\\" and \\"courage.\\"  Since Eugen's rise was predicated on his military abilities, this is an unfortunate (and glaring) omission.<br /><br />Nonetheless, if you're interested in the period or the place (Austria-Hungary), this is a very useful biography of an important figure who is all too often forgotten today.	2005-07-07
US	51327425	R3V6RVG9QQWFGX	0393050726	712590772	The Great Divide: The Rocky Mountains in the American Mind	Books	3	7	8	N	N	Pleasant account of the Rockies in popular culture	This book nicely reviews how the place of the Rockies in the American imagination has changed over time.  Americans originally saw the Rockies as a worthless \\"desert\\" but later became interested in classical conservation (like Teddy Roosevelt).  Recent decades have seen the arrival of hippies, temporary residents, tourists, and dude ranches, among others.  The book does not focus on the factual side of these changes - how many hippies were there and where did they go or how long did they stay - but rather on everyone's alleged views of the Rockies.  In other words, it is more an \\"intellectual\\" history than a social, economic or political history, and a pop-intellectual history at that.<br /><br />As is normal for these kinds of books, the evidence is not systematic but anecdotal.  Ferguson's synthesis of each period's view of the Rockies is highly personal and it would be easy to construct alternative accounts.  His book also does not go into any great depth, though it compensates for this in breadth of coverage.  It can't hold a candle to Nash's \\"Wilderness and the American Mind,\\" but it does cover a slightly different cast of characters and would be a fine companion volume.<br /><br />The main line of the narrative warrants some reflection.  Ferguson sees a development over the last century from early tourists who wanted to spend extended time in the Rockies, whether camping or visiting dude ranches, to the modern tourist who wants to drive through the park, take a few pictures, and leave.  If you're thinking of buying this book for a vacation in the Rockies, I hope you'll be one of the people who relax and stay a while.<br /><br />All in all, the book was interesting enough, well-written and a quick read.  However, it didn't leave a lasting impression and I wouldn't go out of your way to read it.  It would make a pleasant companion on a hotel balcony overlooking a mountain, or outside your tent in the backcountry.  I gave it three stars as part of a struggle to stop grade inflation at Amazon, but most people would probably give it four.e to stop grade inflation at Amazon, but most people would probably give it four. <br />	2005-07-07

They are certainly qualified to do this, being fully bilingual journalists; he is Quebecois, she is Ontarian.  Though they are Canadian, they are writing for a US audience as much as for a Canadian one, and they regularly compare all three countries.<br /><br />The book consists of three parts: \\"Spirit,\\" \\"Structure,\\" and \\"Change.\\"  The part on Spirit is by far the best.  It provides a good entry to diverse aspects of the French mindset, sometimes using the device of \\"studying the aborigines\\" in France.  These include, for example, the French attitude toward land, their fondness for grandeur, and their notions of private and public space.  The section is full of anecdotes and discussions with French people, and these voices come through very well.<br /><br />The section on \\"Structure\\" is much less successful.  Perhaps, as a political scientist, I am inclined to be overly critical of those who discuss politics without the analytical apparatus that the discipline uses.  Still, I see that other reviewers were also disappointed in this section.  I think the problem is that the authors rely too much on \\"regular people\\" as sources.  This strategy works really well when people are talking about their own views of things, as in the \\"Spirit\\" section.  It doesn't work so well when people are talking about things outside themselves, especially if those things may require some expertise to understand, such as the economy.<br /><br />When Nadeau and Barlow make generalizations about France, the US, or Canada, it's important to realize that all three of these are diverse countries.  The authors have limited experience in each - - they don't have the same depth of knowledge about (say) Texas, British Columbia, or Marseilles and they do Paris, New York, or Quebec.  As a result, the book jacket and other publicity material very much overstates its case.  The jacket claims that there are a lot of answers in this book - - read it and you will understand France.  Of course, it doesn't work that way.  Still, if you read the book you will understand France better than you did before you read the book.  You'll also enjoy the journey.ity material very much overstates its case.  The jacket claims that there are a lot of answers in this book - - read it and you will understand France.

Porch tells the story largely from an Allied perspective, though he attempts to view the decisions of politicians and generals on both sides.<br /><br />The book's main weakness is its central argument.  Porch wants us to believe that the Mediterranean was an important theater, perhaps even a decisive one.  He admits that the objects of struggle - - Morocco, say, or Crete - - were not important for their own sake.  Instead, he argues that the Mediterranean theater was especially important because Allied forces, especially US forces, could learn from their mistakes in a secondary theater<br /><br />Bluntly put, this argument is built on a paradox: the Mediterranean theater was important because it wasn't important.  It's hard to sustain that claim for the entire length of the war.<br /><br />While the narrative is interesting, Porch's attempts to persuade us of his central thesis don't convince, because he must forever deal with this central paradox.  He could have made a more persuasive case by developing more nuanced claims.  He might have argued that the theater was important up until the moment that Mussolini was overthrown and Italy exited the war.  This stake - - Italian exit from the war - - was clearly important to the war effort, and the Allied strategy was reasonably well designed to achieve this end.  One can naturally debate the decisions to invade Sicily and Anzio, but that is natural in this kind of book.  Operation Torch provided a good campaign for the Americans to learn from their mistakes on the way.<br /><br />After Rome falls, Porch should have given up on, or modified substantially, his thesis. Instead, he tries to maintain his argument for its importance even during the interminable and largely pointless slog up the Italian boot.	2005-03-25
US	51327425	R1HQHEBD90RXLY	0140233881	268657282	Grassland: The History, Biology, Politics and Promise of the American Prairie	Books	4	18	19	N	N	Despite minor flaws, this book will change the way you think	First and most important, this book will change the way you think about the American prairie.  I live here at the edge of the prairie near Indianapolis, and there are a few spots maintained as native prairie.  Manning isn't talking about these little islands but about a huge, free ecosystem and the horrors that we have inflicted upon it and its fauna and flora.  I confess that the image of grizzlies chasing elk calves across the grassland is beguiling, and illustrates what we are missing.  He makes a persuasive case that we need lots and lots and lots of grassland, maintained as such.  Manning has a good story-telling sense, and a good eye for explaining the grassland.  You will not look at the prairie in the same way again.<br /><br />There are some nicely provocative bits.  His vision of the prairie rests on bison ranching, with the animals eating native grasses without irrigation, fertilizer, or other capitalist agriculture.  As if that's not controversial enough, he makes a serious case that a meat-and-leather prairie economy rests easier on the land than food crops such as wheat or corn.  These crops have destroyed the prairie and harm the broader environment because of the extensive irrigation and fertilization required.  Obviously, this strategy of making our agriculture conform to the land instead of forcing the land to conform to our agriculture would be a major change for Americans and others around the world..<br /><br />Manning is not afraid to take the next logical step, and he makes a principled argument against vegetarianism.  Eating free-range bison raised on natural grasslands, he argues, would sit more lightly on the ground and would probably use less (petroleum-based) energy.  This is not your conventional environmentalist, to say the least.<br /><br />Despite those strengths, the book is weakened by a modest number of trivial errors of fact.  These come in sidebar comments about irrelevant matters and have nothing to do with grassland, so I'd rather not list them here.  They did make me question the accuracy of his reporting on grassland, though.  I wouldn't rely on this book as your sole source of facts, but Manning's vision and wonderful writing make it an invaluable book nonetheless.'d rather not list them here.

Scott is the policy director for the Campaign for America's Wilderness, and a past recipient of the John Muir Award, so we are in no doubt where his sympathies lie.<br /><br />Scott has written an admirable little book.  It is short (154 pages of text, with wide margins and lots of sidebar quotes taking up space), so you shouldn't expect an in-depth history of wilderness policy.  However, he packs a lot of information in that space.  He provides a brief overview of attitudes toward wilderness from Teddy Roosevelt through Aldo Leopold and others in the 1920s and 1930s.  After this, his story takes us through the Wilderness Act of 1964 and then into current debates over wilderness.<br /><br />The centerpiece of his story is the question of statutory protection.  Establishing a wilderness in the US requires an act of Congress and can be undone only by a similar act of Congress.  This differs from other imaginable procedures, such as presidential decree or management agency discretion.  Scott shows us why wilderness advocates came to believe that statutory protection was better than agency discretion, even if the agency was broadly sympathetic.  He also argues that wilderness advocates were initially wrong in hoping for agency-based decisions subject only to congressional veto.  Taking sole initiative away from agencies provided an incentive for grassroots citizen movements, which he believes has served the cause of wilderness well.<br /><br />As you can see from my preceding paragraph, Scott gives us enough information so that we can disagree with him - - an admirable trait in any piece of advocacy.  A mountain biker could read this book to understand why Scott's vision of wilderness excludes bicycles, and could also find common ground with Scott on preserving natural areas.  This mountain biker would also gain insight into political strategies for protecting bike trails effectively.<br /><br />Wilderness areas can be found in land managed by the National Park Service, the US Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, and the Fish and Wildlife Service.  Though he doesn't make a big deal out of the differences across agencies - - after all, he has to work with these people - - it's clear that some agencies are easier to work with than others.  He makes a friendly plea for the NPS to rethink how it approaches wilderness, for example.<br /><br />Seeing the past century of wilderness policy also raises questions about our current dilemmas.  Teddy Roosevelt, a Republican, was our greatest conservationist president.  Important legislation passed under Nixon and Ford.  The younger Bush, in contrast, is extraordinarily hostile to wilderness.  Bush has the support of most of the western states in which wilderness lies, though individual counties voted for Kerry (Teton County, Wyoming; Glacier County, Montana; and most of the ski areas in Colorado).  Wilderness advocates need to make coalitions that include these voters, and current strategies don't seem to be working.  Scott's next book might address some of these challenges.egies for protecting bike trails effectively.  <br /> <br />Wilderness areas can be found in land managed by the National Park Service, the US Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, and the Fish and Wildlife Service.

It makes a great introduction to the subject.  Though most of the material will be familiar to the dedicated wolf-freak, even she will learn some new things here.  Steinhardt writes well, and the book is as much a page-turner as a nonfiction book can be.<br /><br />Each chapter combines a particular theme with Steinhardt's discussions of some person relevant to that theme.  For example, the chapter on howling focuses on Algonquin Provincial Park and its summer wolf howls, built around discussions with John Theberge, who started researched Algonquin's wolves by howling at them.  The most amusing of these subject-and-person pairings is the chapter on wolf pack social organization, in which David Mech is characterized as the alpha male of wolf research.<br /><br />Each chapter also includes some musings on the meaning of wolves for humans.  Why do we hunt?  Why do we react to the howl as we do?  Why do some people breed wolf-dog hybrids?  Some of these musings posed interesting questions but I didn't find any of Steinhardt's comments on them particularly insightful.<br /><br />Steinhardt is clearly on the side of the wolves, and I suspect that most of his readers are, too.  Still, he makes an effort to discuss both sides of the issue.  Ranchers and even a retired wolf-bounty hunter find sympathetic portrayals here.<br /><br />The book's overall lack of depth would be my only significant criticism.  To learn more, dig into the \\"further reading\\" that Steinhardt provides at the end.	2005-02-11

The first is a narrative history of the Mormon Church.  The second book consists of a debunking of various Mormon tenets and of Joseph Smith's status as a prophet.  Unfortunately, the second necessarily colors one's evaluation of the first, which would fare very well on its own.<br /><br />The narrative chapters are well-researched, clearly written, and easy to read.  Abanes' narrative flows very well.  He places Joseph Smith in his historical context of Joseph Smith in upstate New York, in a cultural environment that had space for folk magic and occult practices, scam artists, and at a more elevated level, freemasonry.  He is fair-minded in discussing the hostility that the Mormons faced in Missouri and Illinois, and assigns blame to both sides as appropriate.<br /><br />Despite its strengths, Abanes' narrative doesn't demonstrate the kind of critical use of sources or grounding in historiographical debates that you would expect from a professional historian.  Abanes classifies himself as a journalist, and the book reads that way.  It is not really a work of academic history and would fall short of those standards.  It also needs a final round of proofreading as there are too many dumb spelling errors scattered throughout.<br /><br />The second book inside this book is the debunking of Mormonism.  Abanes wants to show that Smith was a false prophet who counterfeited key documents and \\"translations.\\"  Abanes does a very good job tracking down (and documenting) the blatant lies of the LDS leadership, perjury in the Reed Smoot hearings, and current publicity in mainstream outlets that deny central Mormon doctrines and teachings in order to come across as a mainstream Christian denomination.  He also spends a chapter arguing that Mormonism is a \\"sect,\\" though it was not clear to me why pinning that label on the church is important.<br /><br />This debunking is mostly useful material but Abanes should have come clean about his own agenda in presenting it.  As you can see from his website, Abanes is an evangelical Christian who has written on sects and on topics such as magic in Harry Potter and Tolkien.  He doesn't make clear why the LDS Church should draw his fire, but it's not too hard to make some educated guesses.  I just wish that he had made his agenda more explicit in the book itself.  I don't mind agendas when they're stated openly, but Abanes didn't do this.<br /><br />Finally, this agenda probably comes across as \\"anti-Mormon\\" to many people.  The LDS Church is so polarizing that you really have to know where someone is coming from before you can evaluate their writing.  Being more open about his agenda would have strengthened the credibility of his narrative, which I found to be the most interesting parts of the book.s own agenda in presenting it.

Rhodes does a great job presenting Ernest Rutherford and Niels Bohr, two influential scientists with many students.  Rutherford and Bohr (and some others whom Rhodes also introduces) have been overshadowed by Einstein in the public mind.  If this part were a stand-alone book, I'd heartily recommend it with five stars.<br /><br />The middle part of the book narrates the making of the atomic bomb.  Rhodes has an interesting approach to the events leading up to Einstein's famous letter to Roosevelt, making Einstein more a conduit than an independent actor.<br /><br />The book drags when it gets to New Mexico.  I found that Rhodes spent too much time talking about uranium processing, which just isn't all that interesting.  This moves the narrative away from the concepts of physics (and politics) that drove the story earlier, and focuses it on technical improvements in refining ore.  Also, the quality of Rhodes' explanations of the science deteriorated here.<br /><br />The story picks up again as we move to the bomb test and then the two bombs dropped on Japan.  The narrative is compelling.  Rhodes then spends a lot of time on the human consequences of the bomb, especially in Hiroshima.  This is graphic, disturbing, and probably overly repetitive - but I welcomed the repetition as conveying the sheer horror of the events and reminding us of how many people each bomb affected.<br /><br />The conclusion consists of what I thought were superficial political musings about the atomic bomb.  Richard Rhodes wants Leo Szilard to be our hero, and he starts and ends the book with Szilard. Despite Rhodes' efforts, I wasn't convinced that Szilard's insights into the problems of nuclear weapons were any more profound than anyone else's.  Rhodes might have been better off extending the book into about 1945-1955 and the community of nuclear scientists and political scientists wrestling with nuclear doctrine.litical scientists wrestling with nuclear doctrine. <br />	2005-01-14

It is not hate-filled or anti-Mormon, though I suppose some Saints will inevitably view it this way. I would say the tone is more one of sadness, as Robinson has become an evangelical Christian who believes that the LDS Church is seriously wrong.  Some readers will find Robinson's current religious beliefs unnecessarily intrusive or \\"preachy,\\" though they play an important role in her personal journey.<br /><br />Other authors do a better job talking about Mormon history or theology, so I wouldn't read this book as an \\"expose\\" or as an analysis of LDS doctrine.  Instead, read it as a valuable first-person account of an experience with the church and its members.  Robinson is only one person, so her experience may or may not be typical.<br /><br />First, Robinson provides a very interesting narrative of how she was attracted to Mormonism in the first place.  It's interesting to see a first-hand account of how the LDS Church moves in on people who express interest in their faith, and who share the kind of family values that the church emphasizes.<br /><br />Second, Robinson provides an interesting introduction to the LDS Church as experienced by a new member.  One of her legitimate frustrations, and the start of her doubt, was the extensive use of secret rites.  As a result, she felt that she was subject to social pressure to go along with beliefs that were first presented as part of a \\"public\\" (in the temple) rite.  She also describes some Mormon rites that I found theologically shocking; some of these rites have since been changed, though it's not clear from this book whether the underlying doctrines have been changed.*<br /><br />Third, she tells us how she and her husband left Mormonism, and the hostility that this produced in their former friends.  It would be nice if the LDS church could reflect on its attitude toward those who feel they must leave the church, it would reduce the bitterness that many ex-Mormons feel.  Again, Robinson's account is valuable and it does not seem that unusual.<br /><br />In short, this is a good personal account of a journey into, through, and out of Mormonism.  I think both insiders and outsiders will find it interesting and worthy of reflection.<br /><br />--<br />*Addendum in January 2008: I was coy in the original review, but one of these secret rites includes a play in which Jesus and Satan are presented as brothers, an issue that Mike Huckabee raised in the presidential race.

Bush's America	Books	3	32	73	N	N	I want to like this book but I can't	Let me say the nice thing first: Molly Ivins has dug up the way that various policies affect individual Americans.  The examples are shocking and sad for anyone who cares about public policy and real people.<br /><br />That said, her overall case isn't persuasive.<br /><br />1.  You can't pin them all on Bush.  Some of these are Clinton policies, as she occasionally admits but usually sweeps under the rug.<br /><br />2.  The causal links in this book are spotty at best.  There's a lot of innuendo and circumstantial evidence, especially in the chapters on Enron or whenever she mentions campaign contributions.  The book is short of smoking guns.<br /><br />3.  The book jacket and \\"official\\" reviews tell us the book is funny but it isn't.  I can't even tell what the jokes are *supposed* to be, though the odd Texasisms are sometimes mildly amusing.  Dan Rather and Keith Jackson do those funnier, though (not always on purpose).<br /><br />4.  Policy analysis by anecdote isn't very satisfying.  Most policies help some people and hurt other people, and they all cost money, which is unfortunately finite.  Telling stories about the people who get hurt is a helpful reminder that policy matters but unfortunately you also need to do some rigorous analysis too.<br /><br />For example, spending money on meat inspectors might mean spending less money on heating subsidies for the poor.  If you ignore cost-effectiveness, you're saying that we should spend 100% of our money on meat inspectors AND 100% of our money on heating subsidies, AND 100% of our money on everything else we can think of, because a little more spending might help Carrie Ann Smith (not her real name), who has problems.<br /><br />5.  She thinks campaign finance reform will help.  Let's see, we've been reforming since the 1970s, which also happens to be the period in which income inequality has been getting worse in this country.  So campaign finance reform certainly doesn't seem to help the problem much, does it?  Maybe even makes it worse.  I'd much rather get rid of gerrymandering and bring back competitive elections.  (Which Ivins also mentions, much more briefly.)<br /><br />So, read this book and get pissed off.  But you're probably already pissed off.  Don't expect this book to convince anyone unless their mind is already made up.uch, does it?  Maybe even makes it worse.

In this book, Nevada Barr is at her best in executing the two features that make this series enjoyable: the mystery itself, and the natural setting of our national parks.<br /><br />The mystery is a form of the \\"closed room\\" mystery in which only a small set of people could possibly be suspects.  The suspects here are all very experienced cavers, and the closed room is a deep descent in Carlsbad Caverns.  There's also some chance that the apparent felonious assaults in the mystery are in fact accidents--obviously, this is a murder mystery, so one of them is felonious but you'll enjoy trying to figure the others out.<br /><br />The setting is Carlsbad Caverns and a secondary cave just outside the park.  Barr does an extraordinary job conveying the feeling of an inexperienced caver in her first deep descent.  Because Anna Pigeon is an experienced rock climber, she is a plausible candidate to go deep on her first caving expedition, a rescue mission.  Yet her inexperience allows Barr to convey both the beauty and the terrifying aspects of a cave.<br /><br />The descriptions of the cave are wonderful.  Though I've been shallow in tourist sections of caves, this book conveys better than any other I can imagine why cavers would obsess over the wonders of caves.  Read it and see.<br /><br />The terror of being underground also adds to the excitement of the mystery.  This is a very nice dramatic touch.<br /><br />Like other Barr novels, this has a few \\"action adventure\\" moments.  Unlike a few others (especially High Sierra), the action stays within the realm of plausibility.<br /><br />The entire novel is well-constructed and fast-paced.  Highly recommended!	2004-12-29

You'll enjoy the book.  Whittlesey provides a rich collection of stories, no two alike.<br /><br />You might enjoy reading about stupid people so that you can feel superior to them.  If you like the \\"Darwin Awards,\\" about people who improve the gene pool by dying as a result of their own mind-boggling stupidity, you'll like this book.  My favorite was the swan dive into the hot spring pool.<br /><br />You might be thinking about going to Yellowstone, and you didn't realize that it might be dangerous.  Well, it might be.  So is life.  Whittlesey includes heart attacks, auto accidents and murders, all of which might occur anywhere.  Some stories are good cautionary stories about the dangers of being unprepared in the outdoors.  He also includes those stupid people I mentioned in the last paragraph.<br /><br />If you didn't know that bison are Very Large Animals Who Could Hurt You, you might want to read this book so that you don't fall over a waterfall.<br /><br />Don't play with the bears, either.  I've seen people try to play with two mating bears, while two rangers chased the idiot across a hillside of fallen trees.  We don't pay the rangers enough.<br /><br />It's hard to put this book down.  I'm ashamed to admit that I read it entirely in Yellowstone bookstores, but I'm atoning for that by telling you to buy it.  I wish I had bought it, so that I could read it again right now.	2004-11-20

Read this way, it's fascinating and well-written.  Those of us who don't get by on $6-7/hour should know what it's like for those who do.<br /><br />You might read this book for its politics.  If you're on the Left, you'll like it; on the Right, you'll hate it.  For good reasons.<br /><br />You might want to read this book to think seriously about public policy.  Reading the book this way is very tricky.  Ehrenreich provides plenty of anecdotes -- her own experiences, and the experiences of those she meets.  Anecdotes are a very weak foundation for public policy, though they're a good motivation for getting interested in public policy.<br /><br />You might also read this book as a civil libertarian.  Ehrenreich documents appalling violation of civil liberties and human decency.  Most readers will direct that anger toward businesses, but it's important to realize that these violations occur because governments don't enforce the rules we have.<br /><br />If you're in business and actually use some of the personality tests that Ehrenreich discusses, read this book and think twice about what you're doing.  Whether they're ethical or not, I think it's pretty clear from this book that they're ineffective.  Anybody can, and does, game the tests.<br /><br />However you read it, I'd still read it.  It's interesting, well-written, and thought provoking -- as you can probably tell from all the thoughts and non-thoughts that it has provoked here at Amazon.	2004-11-12

Its 28 pictures also provide a nice glimpse into some of the terrain you'll see on those hikes.  It's small and easy to carry in your pack, but it covers a relatively small number of hikes in the park.<br /><br />Each hike listing provides the usual driving and hiking directions found in guide books.  Unlike the other guidebooks here, each hike also includes a topographical map of the hike.  (The Falcon Guide includes elevation information on a separate chart but I still find the topo easier to use.)  This makes the book very useful for armchair planners who haven't yet taken my advice to buy the Trails Illustrated map.<br /><br />In addition, each hike includes a brief \\"special attention\\" section that is surprisingly helpful.  For example, if a given trail is closed in early summer for bear management, you'll see that fact highlighted here instead of being hidden in the text.<br /><br />The best part of the book is the \\"naturalist notes,\\" however.  The selling point of this book is that it is written by two rangers who are used to sharing their knowledge along a trail.  That's exactly what they do here.  As a result, it is easier to visualize the trail experience from this book than from any of the other guides I've seen.	2004-10-26

Trails Illustrated also sells some maps of particular regions of the park such as Tower/Canyon at 1:83,333 scale.  (The map of the whole park is 1:168,500.)  The bigger map is perfectly serviceable for any hike that you might want to take, and I can't find any place in the park where the big map would lead you astray.  Still, if you like having the smaller scale, go for it.<br /><br />The small maps do have the advantage of showing specific backcountry campsites.  If you use the larger map, you have to coordinate with other books that show these sites.<br /><br />Like other Trails Illustrated maps, this one comes with all sorts of practical information on the back side of the map.  None of this will be new to you if you've read the usual guide books, but it's moderately useful having it repeated here.  One very helpful feature of this map is that it shows the burn areas so that you can avoid moderately or heavily burnt forests.<br /><br />The trail numbers on this map are coordinated with Day Hiking Yellowstone by Tom Carter.  I don't have that book so I can't vouch for how useful it is.  However, it's easy to coordinate the numbered trails with other books that I do have (such as Lonely Planet Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks, Hiking Yellowstone National Park: A Falcon Guide, and A Ranger's Guide to Yellowstone Day Hikes).<br />-----<br />Added in April 2008: the more I hike in the park, the less happy I am with this map because of the scale.  It's great for seeing longer trails at a glance.  But if you're a day-hiker, you probably want one of the four smaller-scale maps covering (more or less) the four corners of the park.	2004-10-26

It has enough information to get you started about any activity you like: backpacking, biking, boating, camping, fishing, hiking, horseback riding, mountaineering and rock climbing, and winter sports.  You'll want another book for the more involved of these activities--especially backpacking, mountaineering and rock climbing--but you probably already knew that.<br /><br />If you're on a family vacation, the book is near indispensable.  There is good coverage of a nice range of day hikes.  It's also exhaustive in telling you the other opportunities available that you might not have thought of by yourself.  Rafting down the Snake or biking on the valley floor of Jackson Hole are two good family activities.<br /><br />There's also plenty of information here about regulations, places to stay and eat, and suggestions for other excursions in the area.  The written material (but not the maps, alas) is organized very effectively into regions that really do follow the natural organization of these parks.  Once you sketch out an itinerary, the information you want is grouped together and the information you don't need is elsewhere.<br /><br />Despite these strengths, I find the organization of the book a little odd and I found that it took a while to get used to using it effectively.  For example, the last three chapters are on Greater Yellowstone History, Geology, and Ecosystem.  You might think that this information belongs earlier in the book as part of your orientation to the area.  The book has a nice collection of maps, but they are in a weird location in the middle of the book that forces you to flip back and forth to use them as trip planners for hotels, activities, and hiking trails.  These might go more naturally at the very front or back of the book.  There are some nice full-color pictures scattered throughout the book (mostly in the front), but none of them go with the text that surrounds them.them go with the text that surrounds them.  <br />	2004-10-26

Like other Falcon guides, it provides maps of each trail and valuable information about elevations and steepness.  Each listing include elevation diagrams that are very useful for letting you know what you are getting yourself into.<br /><br />This is probably the best all-around guide to hiking the Grand Tetons.  It's especially useful for finding good hikes while sitting at home.  Bill Schneider writes well and does a good job describing the hikes so that you can decide which ones are best for you.

These \\"chapters\\" are easily accessible and written at about a middle-school level.  The book as a whole is very kid-friendly, though it wasn't necessarily written that way.<br /><br />The book has very good advice for how, where, and when to spot mammals in these parks.  The section on each animal concludes with \\"where to find bighorn sheep\\" (or whatever). We've successfully spotted most of these animals, initially relying on the advice here, though we now have a few secrets of our own.<br /><br />Our favorite charismatic megafauna are bears, wolves, and cougars.

Like other Falcon guides, it provides maps of each trail and valuable information about elevations and steepness.  The information is clearly organized, and summarized at the head of each trail listing.<br /><br />Like other Falcon guides it has a chart listing best flat terrain day hike, best wildlife viewing, most strenuous, best scenery, and so on.  The information here is good for those hikes I've taken.  Bill Schneider writes well and does a good job describing the hikes so that you can decide which ones are best for you.  If you consult just one book on the trails of Yellowstone, this is the one to use.<br /><br />I'm not fond of the regional organization of the book, which sorts hikes into Northwest, Northeast, Southwest and Southeast.  Reasonable as that sounds, it's not really how the park is organized spatially.  The Belcher area, for example, is a region unto itself that has to be accessed from outside the park in Idaho.  Yet this book lumps it together with the trails around Old Faithful.  The Southeast trails include those on the South Entrance road, which is really much closer to Old Faithful, as well as trails around Lake and Fishing Bridge, which are closer to Canyon.  This means that if you're staying at Old Faithful or Canyon and looking for day hikes nearby, you have to flip back and forth between two (or even three) sections.  (See the Lonely Planet Guide for a more successful organizational scheme.)	2004-10-26

They seem more deeply familiar with the park than the others, and show evidence of having been on many of the trails several times, in different seasons. <br /> <br />The book is less user-friendly for armchair planning back home  They combine all the trails in a single area on a single map.  This has the advantage of letting you compare routes, but I'd really rather have a single map for each hike and compare routes on my topo.  They often combine trails in a single description, or put distinct hikes as variants in the text of some other hike.  This is useful information but more demanding for the reader looking for hikes.  If you want pre-digested trail information, especially day hikes, go with Stone.   <br /> <br />This book is really most useful for multi-day trips in the backcountry.  The best feature are the pen-and-ink drawings of scenery from particular locations.  For example, p. 91 has a \\"View toward the Tetons from the Teton Crest Trail at the head of Death Canyon,\\" identifying seven peaks and two other features. <br /> <br />This book is also organized more around geology, landscape, habitat and wildlife, and includes checklists in the back for the animals that you might spot.  I like reading this information while I'm on the trail.  Because of this and the drawings, this is the guide that I am most likely to carry in my pack.

Though I am far from expert, I regularly spotted birds that do not have a listing in the text.  (The checklist in the back seems pretty exhaustive, though.)<br /><br />However, the book is very useful if your interests lie in spotting birds in GTNP.  Raynes knows the area well and discusses the habitats of the park, the birds to be found in each habitat, and provides a map showing you how to find what you want.  The book provides a surer guide to finding things than a guide covering a wider area such as the Audubon guides.  On the other hand, the Audubon guides provide much more coverage and are more dependable for identifying things that you see.<br /><br />Another limitation of the book is that many of the habitats that Raynes discusses lie off-road.  The book doesn't provide any guidance for finding trails that will get you to the habitat and birds you're looking for.  Unless you want to stay in your car, you'll need a guide to trails.<br /><br />If you do stay in your car, you should know that the road map is incomplete.  For example, it does not show the dirt road out to Two Ocean Lake or the dirt road along the right bank of the Snake.  (Both of these are really only for four-wheel drive vehicles but are useful access points to good habitat.)<br /><br />The book would be most useful for beginning birders or park visitors who aren't really birders but would like to identify the birds that come their way.  It is lightweight and will fit in many pants or jacket pockets.	2004-10-26

This is probably a bit excessive -- are you really going to take 72 day hikes unless you live there?  In addition, some of them are really just variants of one another that you could figure out yourself with a map.  (The Bradley and Taggart Lakes loops, for example, as do the Willow Flats hikes between Jackson Lake Lodge and Colter Bay Village.)<br /><br />The hikes are well organized by region.  The book includes a separate map for each hike showing trails, cutoffs, local roads and other landmarks.  Unlike the Falcon guides, there is no information about elevations on the maps.<br /><br />The information is good but not abundant.  Most trails get only a single page of text, and the hiking directions are only a paragraph or so.  Obviously this is necessary to cover the number of hikes in the book.  Armchair planners will be frustrated, however, as there is not enough trailside information to help you decide which hikes you would find most interesting.<br /><br />I'd recommend Schneider's book instead (see all my reviews).	2004-10-26

It fits better in roomy pants pockets, jacket pockets, or the side pocket of a day pack.<br /><br />The book has everything, including some geology and habitat information as well as mammals, reptiles, amphibians, insects, birds and plants.  It's exhaustive for the mammals that I've seen in the Rockies and nearly exhaustive for birds.  It has good, small pictures of everything with information about ranges and seasons.

He has retained his childlike curiosity, and enjoys poking around under rocks, climbing trees to look around, and conducting simple experiments in the woods to see what will happen.<br /><br />He has long since grown up into a scientist and a teacher as well.  As a result, he knows how to take notes, conduct a literature review, justify his conclusions, and convey information to readers.<br /><br />In this book, he does all this very well in trying to figure out a puzzle of raven behavior.  If you want to walk with him on an intellectual journey, this is a five-star book.<br /><br />But . . . I wanted a book about ravens.  Instead of the journey, I wanted the destination.  There is a better book out there on ravens, and as it turns out, Bernd Heinrich wrote that one, too.  If, like me, you want to know what we know about these remarkable, intelligent birds, read Heinrich's \\"Mind of the Raven\\" instead.	2004-10-12

While most of other books are set in Maine, here Heinrich travels farther afield to discuss ravens in the Arctic, Yellowstone, a pet raven in Germany, and elsewhere -- in addition to his own wild and tame ravens in Maine.<br /><br />I can imagine some scientists (and others) being annoyed by Heinrich's style.  His research questions are guided by his own natural curiosity and not by what the scientific community defines as important.  He isn't trained as an ornithologist.  Heinrich clearly depends on his own observations and does not like to delegate -- so his methods are not those of a scientist running a lab or something like a lab.  For most of us, though, these \\"faults\\" make him all the more interesting.  He is certainly high on the list of authors I'd like to invite to dinner.<br /><br />Heinrich also seems to be a born teacher.  He does a great job explaining ravens as well as explaining the process of discovery that brings him to his conclusions.<br /><br />If you think that a bird can't possibly be conscious (or self-conscious), that a bird can't be intelligent, and that a bird can't have a real personality, this book will drive you nuts.  If you think any of those things are *possible*, Heinrich gives you some thought-provoking stories about ravens.	2004-10-12

If you love books about wild animals and wish that someone would write about trees, this book is for you.  Heinrich takes you to his forest in Maine and explores the trees in it.  Some have personalities, and they live as part of a community of trees, animals and sometimes people.<br /><br />Heinrich writes well, as readers of his other books know.  Again, his natural curiosity shines through, as does his storytelling and teaching abilities.<br /><br />The book includes a wonderful set of drawings by Heinrich.  Unfortunately, most of them aren't discussed in the text so it's hard to know what to make of them.<br /><br />Much as I enjoyed the book, I wish that Heinrich had spent some time on tree identification.  It would be much easier for me to observe the trees in my forest -- if I had a forest -- if I knew all their names.<br /><br />Those criticisms aside, this was a thoroughly enjoyable book.  I also came away with an understanding of how a true forest differs from the monoculture tree farms that are taking over parts of our country.  While he walks us through his experiences trying to maintain a forest, he also provides lessons in sustainable forestry.	2004-10-12

(The short answer is that you die.)  In light of the short answer, how can any animal survive Maine winters of 30 or 40 degrees below zero?  Obviously simple hibernation doesn't keep you from freezing.<br /><br />What about animals that stay active through the winter?  How do they find enough food to generate enough heat to stay warm?<br /><br />How do plants and animals know when to switch to winter mode?  When spring is here?  What happens when they're wrong?<br /><br />How do all these strategies for winter survival interact with one another in a particular habitat?  How are tree and bird strategies interwoven, for example?<br /><br />Heinrich answers these and more.  He is a very clear, strong writer, as well as a talented illustrator.  He is also fascinated by kinglets, who get more attention than other species in the book, but I must say that even now I do not share that fascination.  Though kinglets may not be so fascinating, the book *is*, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.	2004-10-12

You have to take a boat trip of at least three hours to get there, and your options leave from out-of-the-way places like Houghton or Copper Harbor, Michigan, and Grand Portage, Minnesota.  As a result, the people who go there tend to say a while--four days, on average.  The park is 99% wilderness, so most of those people are backpacking, canoeing or kayaking, while the rest stay at the Rock Harbor Lodge and take day trips.<br /><br />Given this usage, the book that every visitor needs is Jim Dufresne's guide to trails and water routes.  Dufresne also includes information about the flora and fauna.<br /><br />However, \\"Superior Wilderness\\" should be your second book.  It is organized around chapters dealing with particular habitats and an animal found in that habitat.  Shelton talks about squirrels, falcons and snowshoe hares as well as the famous wolvees and moose.  Shelton also spends a lot of time on the forests and the varieties of flora in different parts of the island.  (If you like trees, supplement this book with Bernd Heinrich's \\"The Trees in my Forest.\\")<br /><br />I found the book interesting before I went to Isle Royale, and I enjoyed reading it again after my return.  The writing style put me off a little bit, which is why I gave it 3 stars instead of 4.  Shelton reaches for lyricism about nature but doesn't, in my opinion, quite pull it off.  If you want lyricism, read Bernd Heinrich's books.<br /><br />The author's own comments state that he wrote the book for armchair travelers as well as for people visiting the island.  If you want to read about Isle Royale without going there, this is the best book available (and I'd give it four stars).	2004-09-03

He describes the hikes in some detail and describes the features of each hike well enough so that you can plan what you want to do.<br /><br />Dufresne divides the book into long hikes, short hikes, and canoe trips and portages.  The long hikes are multi-day backpacking trips, while the short hikes are day trips out of the two ranger stations (Rock Harbor and Windigo).  The book also has some helpful background information about the park and NPS rules.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the mileages listed for some long hikes don't capture the whole distance.  For example, Dufresne counts the Feldtmann loop as 24 miles, starting at Windigo and ending at the junction of the Island Mine trail and the Greenstone Ridge trail.  Sorry, but you have to get back to the boat, and it's another 7 miles to Windigo from that junction.  This means that the loop is 31 miles long, not 24 miles.<br /><br />To avoid surprises like that, pick up the Trails Illustrated map of Isle Royale, which has mileages on it, to supplement this book.	2004-09-03

Peterson certainly knows the material, since he has led the island's wolf-moose study for decades.  The book presents a mix of scientific findings, stories from the wolf-moose study, and Peterson's personal experiences and the island.  It's well-written, though the mixture of these materials sometimes seems a bit random.<br /><br />If your primary interest lies in the science of wolves, I'd read Durward Allen's Wolves of Minong instead.  But for everyone else, this should be your first book on Isle Royale and the wolves.<br /><br />The greatest strength of this book is its photographs.  These include wildlife shots, pictures of study staff dissecting carcasses, landscapes of Isle Royale, and a few shots of Peterson and his family.  The photographs, the color, and the paper the book is printed on are all top-notch.<br /><br />Peterson argues that the wolf population may be in crisis.  Fortunately, wolf numbers have turned around since he wrote this book.  His concluding chapter, about whether we should reintroduce \\"non-native\\" wolves to Isle Royale if they died out naturally, is very thoughtful and thought-provoking.	2004-09-03

The Canadian government sent him into the Arctic to study the wolf's role in killing caribous that human hunters wanted to kill instead.<br /><br />What makes this a great book is Mowat's understated humor in many places, his humorous sarcasm of bureaucracy, and a handful of funny set-piece situations -- such as how he ended up chasing wolves naked for several miles, inadvertently shocking Inuit women and children.<br /><br />Also, Mowat really did study wolves in the Arctic, but not in the way that he describes here.  There's a fair amount of fiction in the book, though broadly inspired and shaped by his experiences.  Don't take it all as literally true.  Maybe these funny stories really happened but I wouldn't bet the farm.  They are still fully, though.<br /><br />Mowat writes very well, though the vocabulary will be a bit advanced for some teens (and for anyone younger).	2004-08-29

Mitchell successfully reaches beyond the narrowness of his topic to provide an interesting account of Maltese society, politics, and history.  Since there isn't much competition, the book is clearly the best of its kind, but it would stack up pretty well against potential competition as well.  The book is informed by anthropological and sociological theories of various kinds but Mitchell wears his learning lightly.<br /><br />He centers his book on an annual festival honoring St. Paul that occurs in a particular neighborhood (L'Arcipierku) in the capital city of Valetta.  Because St. Paul is the patron saint of Malta, this festival is of national, and nationalist, importance, opening up general questions of identity.  While Mitchell squeezes a lot out of this festival and this neighborhood, I was left wanting more.  What about the rival neighborhood of Due Balli and its festival?  How do people in the national as a whole react?<br /><br />Now that Malta has joined the European Union, I hope we will see more books addressing this fascinating country.	2004-08-12

This means that if you don't like the argument, you have to go back to the Bible and explain why your reading is better than Miner and Connoley's reading.  It also means that if you like their conclusion, you still have to go back and figure out whether the argument was persuasive.<br /><br />They make the argument in three ways.<br /><br />First, they argue that the biblical passages used to \\"clobber\\" gays have been misread.  This misreading is most convincing for Lot and Sodom, where the anti-gay interpretation is clearly twisted.  The authors' argument is more debatable for Leviticus, Romans, and 1 Corinthians.  If you read the Bible in historical context, you'll probably be convinced; if you like to memorize passages in isolation, you won't be persuaded.<br /><br />Second, they argue that gays and lesbians can be found in the Bible and receive sympathetic treatment.  I loved this part of the book, though parts are pretty speculative.  David and Jonathan was the most convincing, Ruth and Naomi the weakest.  However, Christians should be most interested in the New Testament and not the Old.  This makes the account of Cornelius, a Roman centurion, and his slave (whom Peter healed) particularly interesting.<br /><br />Third, the authors move beyond close readings of the biblical text to argue that Jesus's central message affirms gay and lesbian partnerships.  I was pleasantly surprised to see this chapter in a book by two admittedly conservative Christians.  It's good to remember that Jesus rejected the narrow legalisms of the Judaism of his time.  This is why I've never understood why anti-gay readings of the Bible rely so much on the rules in Leviticus, which they don't pretend to follow in their own lives.<br /><br />In short, this book makes a good but not flawless argument that the Bible does not condemn committed same-sex couples.  Read it with an open mind and heart, go back to the Bible, and see what God tells you.d and heart, go back to the Bible, and see what God tells you. <br />	2004-08-12

Instead of treating them as isolated oddballs, Krakauer connects them to the history of the Church of Latter Day Saints. He presents that history fairly, covering some violent episodes that the LDS hierarchy would like us all to forget.<br /><br /> Krakauer writes very well, though I thought the prose moved less well here than in his other books.<br /><br /> The main challenge of this book is the gap between extremists and mainstream. Krakauer would like us to see the extremism of the Laffertys in the mainstream church, but the mainstream church has excommunicated these extremists. Obviously these extremists are a product of an LDS environment. Just as obviously, they rejected the LDS church and it rejected them. This raises more complicated questions of &quot;blame&quot; and &quot;responsibility&quot; than Krakauer really addresses.	2004-08-06

The most distinctive element is his novelist's eye for characters.  Unlike most accounts of campaigns and battlefields, he gets inside the leaders' heads in the way a novelist would.<br /><br />Though he includes some material from soldiers' diaries and the like, the account remains elite-centered.  As other reviewers correctly note, this means that the role of African-Americans is underemphasized (but not absent).  For this side of the war, I'd recommend James McPherson.<br /><br />Much more so than most histories, Foote emphasizes events outside Virginia, including campaigns in the trans-Mississippi.  This is valuable, since the war was won (and lost) in the West.<br /><br />Foote clearly sides with the South, which has the potential to annoy this Northerner.  Fortunately, his leanings appear more as symmpathy for the people involved than as strong bias or polemic.<br /><br />Finally, this trilogy really is long, with each book near 1000 pages in smallist type.  I found it congenial to take a break between books, each of which is self-contained.	2004-08-06

He addresses both human stupidity and real courage on the top of Mt. Everest.<br /><br />One thing that makes this book controversial is that Krakauer has many critical things to say about climbers.  Fortunately, he includes himself among them, though he has apparently given up climbing about 8000 meters.  He also distinguishes among amateurs, guides, and self-guided climbers.  As a result, I would say that he respects other people's views even when he (strongly) disagrees with them.<br /><br />That said, this isn't really a book about criticizing a sport, but a compelling adventure yarn.	2004-08-06

I found McCandless an interesting character, but the parts of the book that I remember most are Krakauer's two chapters on his own wanderlust  This led him to his own adventure that could have taken his life in the same way that McCandless' took his.<br /><br />Krakauer and McCandless both went through more extreme versions of this wanderlust than most people, but many of us feel it more weakly.  His insights into this part of the human condition make the book.	2004-08-06

It can be a bit dry if you are not used to academic prose, though this didn't bother me (I'm an academic in a different field).  Allen's text is enriched by extensive charts, figures, and BW photos.  On the down side, he spends more time than I would like on non-wolf topics and on the logistics of the long-term wolf study on Isle Royale.  I would also have liked more comparisons with wolves living elsewhere in North America as the Isle Royale environment has its peculiarities.<br /><br />Criticisms aside, it's a very good book and I almost gave it five stars.	2004-08-02

In fact, it's in the running for the worst one, but I have others yet to read.  The characters are thin and the plot predictable.<br /><br />This is not a book for mystery lovers, though if you like action-adventure movies the final third of the book is for you.  Like the movies, though, the events were unbelievable and the heroine should have been dead several times over.  Even so, I kept reading, which is how this book squeezed out that second star.<br /><br />I was also surprised that Barr seems to dislike Yosemite so much.  Even more puzzling, she keeps praising the Natchez Trace Parkway, which is not exactly a crown jewel of the national park system.  To each her own, I guess.	2004-08-02

Mech managed to do it at a remote site in the arctic.  Some of his observations confirm the conventional wisdom, others do not.

The heroine, Anna Pigeon, is a great character.  She also has rich relationships with other characters, especially a long-distance relationship with her sister Molly, a friendship from an earlier book, and a significant-other-to-be introduced here.<br /><br />Though the characters made it a good book, this wasn't entirely satisfactory as a mystery.  I thought it relatively easy to figure out Who Done It even before the victim was murdered, thanks to a random off-site clue and the book jacket.  Fortunately, I remained unclear about whether the murderer had accomplices, and whether any of those secondary stories would end up being relevant.  These plot points kept me involved, and thanks to the characterization the book was hard to put down.<br /><br />Isle Royale National Park plays an important role in the park.  It's interesting that this was Barr's first job in the National Park Service.  Here as in her other books, she has an interesting perspective on rangers and tourists.  As someone who has backpacked on Isle Royale, I didn't mind her dumping on the boaters (though the boaters I've met there were pleasant enough).  It would have been good to see backpackers in the book, and I wish that Anna Pigeon had spotted a wolf somewhere on the island.  But that's just me.<br /><br />As someone who loves Isle Royale and the North Woods, I was also mildly annoyed that Barr complained so much about the place -- the weather, the woods, and so on.  It's clear from her other books that she is a warm-weather person who loves the South, the desert, and California.  I still liked the book, but if you're a northerner like me you'll probably experience similar annoyances.<br /><br />Like High Sierra and a few other Barr books, this one has its unbelievable action hero moments at the very end.  I really wish that Anna Pigeon would call for backup when she has solved the crime instead of confronting the villain one-on-one in the wilderness.  Nevada Barr needs to rescue Anna Pigeon in some way other than a blackout at the hands of the villain (as in both Superior Death and High Sierra).nstead of confronting the villain one-on-one in the wilderness.

It is well written, though the style is sometimes a bit too \\"breathless\\" for my tastes. McMillion doesn't shy away from the blood and gore of the injuries, which some people will like and some people will not.<br /><br />His stories concern a nice mix of people. Grizzlies attack some smart people who ended up in a bad situation, and some dumb people who brought on the attacks by making poor choices. Even the smart people would probably do a few things differently in hindsight, but the stories are told very sympathetically.<br /><br />McMillion's treatment of these attacks is balanced, and he doesn't really side with humans or grizzlies. He also dispassionately reports park management decisions to kill or not kill the bear, and provides enough information for readers to make up their own minds. He generally seems supportive of rangers' decisions, though. He is most critical of Banff NP, rightfully so based on the facts that he provides.<br /><br />One Amazon reviewer claims that this book is anti-people and anti-gun. This claim isn't reasonable. McMillion tells us of some people who saved their lives with guns, and he clearly values human life. He also values the grizzlies. He doesn't think that either guns or pepper spray will solve all your problems in grizzly country.	2004-08-02

This is well-written and thorough guide to backpacking.  It provides helpful ideas for backpackers at all levels, not just beginners.<br /><br />Like any book, it has its biases.  Townsend is a long-distance solo backpacker with most of his experience in western North America, Britain, and Scandinavia.  He often hikes on snow, and spends a significant amount of time on skis.  He is a vegetarian with a minimalist approach to backcountry cuisine.<br /><br />What does this mean?  First, the weekend backpacker will find a lot of material that goes well beyond his needs.  This stems from the book's efforts to be useful to people at many different levels.  At the other extreme, a highly experienced backpacker will find much of the book too basic, though as a long-distance hiker Townsend will provide various nuggets of advice even for her.<br /><br />Second, Townsend almost completely ignores fishing.  This is a popular part of the backpacking experience for many people and should be included.  (I suppose a little advice for backpacking hunters would probably also be helpful.)  Since Townsend doesn't hunt or fish, he may want to take on a coauthor in future editions who can help him a little in these areas.<br /><br />Third, Townsend has nothing to say about experiencing the wildnerness by canoe.  This objection may be unfair, since canoeing isn't exactly \\"backpacking.\\"  However, many people combine canoeing with backpacking and portaging in a way that probably belongs in an exhaustive guide to backpacking.  Certainly, Townsend's extensive discussions of cross-country skiing is as much a niche interest as is canoeing.<br /><br />Finally, this is not the book for backcountry recipes or cooking ideas.  However, it is painfully thorough in discussing cooking gear.<br /><br />Townsend reflects the Rockies-and-Sierras bias of most backpacking literature, though (like others) he acknowledges Appalachian Trial hikers.  It's easy to forget that the largest wilderness area in the lower 48, and the most widely visited in the entire country, is the Boundary Waters Canoe Area.  Some experience with North Country backpacking would serve Townsend and other writers well.<br /><br />These criticisms aside, this is the best book of its kind that I have found.  I hope that it continues to evolve in its third edition.rea in the lower 48, and the most widely visited in the entire country, is the Boundary Waters Canoe Area.

I've been to Slovakia several times and successfully used what I learned.  The cassettes provided pronunciation guides and speaking practice that work in Bratislava (I can't vouch for other dialects).  What more do you want from a language book?<br />Some of the other reviewers criticize this book for not being a systematic grammar.  That's fair, since it's not a systematic grammar (though it does have grammar tables in the appendix).  By introducing some major grammar points gradually over several chapters, it can be frustrating as a reference source.<br />As a learning tool, however, there's a lot to be said for introducing things slowly.  If you work systematically through this book and its exercises, and repeat (or memorize) dialogues, you'll learn Slovak.  Some of the material is boring (&quot;Zuzka hears a train crossing the bridge&quot;) though Naughton occasionally livens things up (&quot;Don't be afraid! Kiss me!&quot;).  I'm not sure that any language-book texts can really be exciting.  However, if I were giving Naughton advice, I'd add more paragraph-length texts about Slovakia and its people, along the lines of the Bratislava texts late in the book.	2003-04-26
