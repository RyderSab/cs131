While I continued to read the book, it was very hard to look past the book's obvious flaws.<br /><br />Many of the characters were not developed well, and the whole concept of naming the book _The Good Men_ is very strange.  The Cathars play a very tertiary role in this book, only appearing right before someone dies.  It seemed that the book's real story was about three generations of women and their relationship with a perverted pedophilic priest... and the cover of the book said nothing about that.	2005-08-25

It can service as an instructional knitting book as well as a beautiful coffee-table book!  The pictures are well-detailed and show different parts of the garment or knit.   <br /> <br />The book is set up around how much time the knitter has to knit a gift.  Have a few hours?  There are scarves, knit toys, and other small projects... have a few days?  there are some sweaters and blankets to keep you busy as well. <br /> <br />Although I have not knit anything from the book yet, I purchased my yarn for the Hourglass sweater, and plan to cast on in the coming days.  The Men's raglan zip-up is also on my list.  The patterns are very fashionable and the yarn is easy to substitute for those that cannot find or afford some of the high-end yarns that the author used.  <br /> <br />Well-worth the purchase:  I bought it sight unseen, basing it all on reviews I read through various knitting blogs, and I have not regretted this at all!	2005-08-17

Weitz conducted many interviews and personal research to provide the nine interesting and thought-provoking chapters. She begins with a short history of women's hair, touching briefly on some ancient, medieval and early modern sources and pictures. Most of the book focuses on modern women and the advances within the past one hundred years such as chemical treatments for straightening and relaxing the hair, as well as permanent waves and dyeing treatments. She devotes special portions of the book to African hair, and other ethnic/cultural hairstyles, and how hair makes up the identity of many women. Some particularly interesting styles she mentioned were the Mexican-American &quot;chola&quot; style, dreadlocks, and lesbian hair styles.<br />Why do women dye their hair? How are women affected when they lose their hair (whether they have alopecia, chemotherapy, or a voluntary buzzcut?) What are women's relationships like with their stylist? You will find out some very interesting answers to these questions when you read the book!	2004-06-20

I had heard rave reviews, and heard others that were not so good.  After I read the book, I found that I was not as happy with this book as I originally thought I would be... I had a great appreciation for the time that went into writing the book and the little details about the Greek language (I too labored in Greek college courses)<br />I had a hard time figuring out what time this book took place in--one minute it sounded like the 60s, then maybe the 70s? I finally just thought it might be the 80s. Things seemed a little disoriented to me regarding the timeplace of the book. Other than that slightly irksome feature, I did enjoy the book. The characters were unlikable, but they were supposed to be...<br />Overall this was an intelligent mystery/thriller and I am glad that I read it.	2004-05-29

There is something about these books that really resonates with some readers. After reading the first novel, I did not really jump on the collective Botswana Bandwagon...  I thought the books were nice, but found nothing exceptional about them.  I am glad that I decided to continue with Book 2 though (that was my favorite so far in the series!)  I decided to pick up the other books, starting with book 2, on Audio CD.  I am much happier with the Audio CD versions than I was with reading the book.  I found that reading the stories was a little tedious for me:  The writing is very simplistic, and oftentimes the stories are very predictable.  While these do show up in the Audio CD, I do not find myself as distracted by them as I did when I read the first two in the series.  The reader, Lisette Lecat is absolutely superb.  She is a native South African, and spent a number of years in Botswana.  She knows the rhythm patterns and speech patterns of the people, and she distinguishes each character with a certain voice. This skill makes the dialogues much more interesting than reading them on the page, and her general narration really make the stories come alive for me.  If it were not for her reading the books, I do not know if I would have stuck with this series.<br />The story of _Kalahari Typing School for Men_ was much like its immediate predecessor, _Morality for Beautiful Girls_.  The novel focuses a great amount on the development of some characters, and leaves others &quot;out to dry&quot;, and ultimately strays away from the things that made books 1 and 2 of the series so good: the cases, the interactions, and the values of the Botswana people.  That is not to say that this book does not have any detective cases, but I find the novels have shifted from their original focus.  However, one thing that I did like about this book is the increased role and development of Mma Makutsi.  She is a great characters, and until book 3, Mma Makutsi existed in the shadows.  I look forward to seeing her develop more in the next books.<br />I plan to LISTEN to book 5 very soon.k forward to seeing her develop more in the next books.<br />I plan to LISTEN to book 5 very soon.	2004-05-24

I thought it started out pretty good with the mysterious aristocrats, their rare book library, and the medieval scholarly tie-ins.  It never quite gained the momentum that I was hoping for, but it kept me reading page after page.  I liked Margaret's character, and really appreciated the things that she brought to the story.  However, I thought the whole sub-plot with the computer game, MOMUS, was a little strange, and never quite fit with the rest of the story.  I know that the author was trying to bring the rare manuscript and modern technology together in this game, but it would have been better to leave that plot line out altogether, in my opinion.<br />Yet, the biggest disappointment for me with this novel was the extremely abrupt ending.  Within a few pages, the whole story is dropped completely, and the reader is left wondering &quot;WHAT JUST HAPPENED?&quot;  Even after going back and rereading the text, I still found myself confused in the end.  If Lev Grossman had kept his &quot;day job&quot; as a literary critic and was reading this novel, he would say that this abrupt ending nearly ruined the whole story... so why did he do it in his own debut novel?<br />In the future when I look back and think about this novel, I hope I can remember how much I liked the story, and not the awful ending.	2004-05-21

Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n has created a near-perfect novel: seductive and intriguing characters, a brilliant Spanish locale, and a lyrical style reminiscent of past literary masters.  I found myself reading passages countless times just to savor the words.  The language was so solid and mesmerizing, I could not believe it was a translation. The story lingers in your mind hours and days after reading it, and I become nostalgic; wishing I could read it again for the first time.<br />When Daniel Sempere first enters the labrythine &quot;Cemetary of Forgotten Books&quot;, he does not know that this single episode will change his life forever.  Daniel discovers a novel entitled &quot;Shadow of the Wind&quot; and makes it his mission to find other books by its enigmatic author, Julian Carax.  When he learns that Carax's novels have been systematically destroyed by an elusive stranger, Daniel must protect his volume from the flames.  The more Daniel learns about Carax, the more he realizes the similarities and parallels between his own life and that of the author.<br />Allot a good amount of time for this book, you will not be able to put it down.	2004-05-08

Like Chevalier's celebrated _Girl with a Pearl Earring_, the novel takes a well-known piece of art and creates an elaborate story around it.  This novel focuses on the famous Lady and the Unicorn tapestries in the Cluny Museum in Paris.  Chevalier researched their history, as well as the history of tapestry production for the book, and the reader is granted with the great opporunity to learn more about this lost art.<br />Chevalier's story is narrated by seven different characters at different stages in the tapestries' production.  The painter, and designer of the tapestries, Nicholas des Innocents, plays the prominent role in the narratives because he is the link between the patrons, in Paris, whom the tapestry is being made for, and the weavers in Brussels, who work tirelessly to produce the panels.  The patrons are a wealthy noble family who commission the tapestry to celebrate their daughter's betrothal.  The weaver family in Brussels are working-class laborers who are very skilled in their craft.  Each character plays an important role, and therefore becomes part of the tapestry and its methaphorical story.  Chevalier takes special care with each of her characters and exposes their thoughts, feelings and desires.	2004-05-06

Professor Hollister compiled the first edition of this book in the 1960s, and its popularity is evident in how many editions have been produced. Professor Bennett updated the text and published this ninth edition in 2002.<br />Bennett's updates and additions are very welcome: she adds a great deal of women's history, as well as expanded sections on socio-economics, and religious history. The general layout of the book is also very attractive; it is not a huge tome that will scare people away, rather a small unassuming paperback.  Yet, it is filled with organized and well-researched chapters.  The suggested readings at the end of these chapters were particularly helpful for me.	2004-04-27

Like so many other readers, I really enjoy McCall Smith's stories of Mma Ramotswe, and her Botswana detective service.  Mma Ramotswe is a remarkable character, and I love her simple and moral nature.  Yet, of the three books I have read in this series, I found _Morality for Beautiful Girls_ to be the weakest story so far.<br />Mma Ramotswe is pulled in many different directions in this book, and only a few of the circumstances really go anywhere.  Nearly a whole chapter is devoted to a young boy that is found outside of town, and he is subsequently sent to the &quot;orphan farm&quot;. The matron of the orphan farm, Mma Potakwani, asks Mma Ramotswe to investigate the boy's past, yet that story line fails to go anywhere.  Why spend so much time developing a story only to drop it in the end?  I was left disappointed, and can only hope that this mystery is revisited in the future.<br />Another large loose end: what happened to Mr. J.L.B Matekoni?  In the previous books, he is a main character, however in _Morality for Beautiful Girls_ he is given little face time.  The book did not tell us what brought Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni's depression, and once again, are the readers going to be told what happened in the future?  Like Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, the children from the orphan farm, who played such a large role in _Tears of the Giraffe_ are nearly forgotten in this novel.  What happened to them?<br />Yet there were parts that I really enjoyed as well...  It is exciting to see the development of Mma Makutsi, and her ever-expanding talents and responsibilities.  I look forward to reading more about her.  I particularly liked her case with the beauty pageant, and her quest to find a girl in Botswana with both beauty and integrity.<br />Despite the obvious holes in this novel, I am still looking forward to reading more about Mma Ramotswe and the other characters in the future.	2004-04-24

I loved that quality in her other books, but I was also happy with her fiction in _Coastliners_. Although this book differed from her others in plot, the setting remained the same: France. In this case, the small island of Le Devin, lying off the coast of mainland France. The island inhabitants and the island scenes themselves were so well-written and easy to imagine.<br />The story itself was very entertaining. The main character, Mado, returns to her island home after a ten year absense. She finds that some things have changed, but much remains the same; namely the feud/rivalry between the families on the island. Mado wants to help her family and friends to build up their side of the island, but she encounters hostility and many unforeseen obstacles in the process.<br />In _Coastliners_, Harris constructs a captivating story with interesting plot twists. I enjoyed this book and highly recommend it.	2004-04-18

I found the second installment in the series, _Tears of the Giraffe_ even more enjoyable than the first.  The characters continue to develop nicely and the stories held my attention better than the initial book.  I particularly liked the introduction of the children from the orphan farm, and look forward to the parts they will play in the following books.<br />The writing style and the stories are simple in nature, with morals that transcend the book.  The books are in fact a wonderful advertisement for the country of Botswana, and Africa itself.  Great emphasis is placed upon morality, respect and love.<br />I look forward to the other books about Mma Ramotswe and the rest of the ensemble.	2004-04-15

At the age of 15, the headmaster of his school informs young Daffyd that he is not the son of a Welsh minister and his wife, rather Jacques Austerlitz, a Czech Jewish boy, who was adopted right before the war broke out in Europe.  His parents sent him through Kindertransport to avoid being captured in the war.<br />The complete story is told by an anonymous narrator over a 30 year span.  Our narrator meets Austerlitz in the 1960s, and the two become acquaintances.  They continue to correspond as each character travels around Europe and America.  Each time they meet, Austerlitz relates information about his life.  Therefore, nearly the whole book is told in a story form: the narrator telling us what Austerlitz initially told him.<br />I really liked the premise of this book, but was disappointed in the style.  Because of the narrator-style, the reader feels removed from the overall story.  Austerlitz's life, and his journies were very interesting, but extremely detailed.  I found myself becoming slightly bored with the long descriptive passages, and tangential information.	2004-04-08

She was born one year after the war ended, and she remembers vividly what her elders told her about those years.  In her Introduction to _Tearing the Silence_, she states why she wrote this book, and how it helped her identify with her cultural heritage.  With the title _Tearing the Silence_ she makes her point very clear: Post-war German immigrants have stories to tell.<br />Hegi conducted interviews with post-war German immigrants in the US. Most of the stories were similar to her own: born and raised in Germany during, or after, World War II, and immigration to the United States before age 20. Some are children of SS officers, others are children of privates.  Some live happy lives and do not focus on the past, others are haunted by what happened.<br />There are some great stories in the book--very thought-provoking.  I was amazed at how some of the same phrases were repeated in all of the stories--even though the interviewees never met each other.  Many were told that there parents &quot;...never knew about the Holocaust&quot;, and others said &quot;Germans suffered too...&quot;<br />With _Tearing the Silence_, Hegi provided a much-needed contribution to World War II history, and biography.	2004-04-01

All of ther money, from her night job as a prostitute, and her day job as a potter's assistan, goes directly to her baby, who has a rare and deformative illness.  Her pimp wants to insure the safety of his dress investment, so Gustine is followed every night in her dealings by an old one-eyed woman, only known as &quot;The Eye&quot;.<br />Henry, the medical doctor, is a well-to-do man, with a lovely and charitable fianc&eacute;, Audrey.  He relies on Gustine to find bodies for him to use for his classes, and for personal research.  Cholera strikes in the town, and Henry needs to study the illness and its victims in order to find out more about a cure.<br />Holman's writing was very descriptive, and I found that oftentimes the characters suffered from over-development.  I almost knew too much about the characters, and became disgusted by them.  Cholera plays an interesting role in the novel, almost a whole character.  The book begins with &quot;Cholera is coming&quot; and much talk swarms about the disease.  When it finally strikes, and takes many people in the poor districts, it continues to play a major role.<br />While I found the book to be well-written, I did lost interest in the story about 1/2 of the way.  I know I am in the minority here, but I thought the second half of the book was weak.  However, I plan to read more of Holman's books.  I particularly like her style of historical fiction.	2004-03-28

Alexa Albert's study in Nevada's well-known (and now defunct) Mustand Ranch brothel was a fascinating read.

No public health official, or doctor had ever conducted a study in a brothel, seemingly the most obvious place to learn about it.  Albert begins the book talking about her study, but the rest of the book is more of a journalistic style, reporting on the lives and trials of the Mustang Ranch prostitutes.  The prostitutes are not portrayed as whores or drug addicts, but real women with outside lives, families to support, and educated minds.<br />She became friends with some of the women, and continues to correspond with them, even after Mustang Ranch was shut down by the IRS in the late 1990s.	2004-03-28

There were some highlights however, among those, how Lily and Mabel's relationship grew.<br />I was not enthusiastic about this story, but I plan to give Hustvedt another chance.	2004-03-18

He turns to the only witness: the couple's Rhodesian Ridgeback, Lorelei.  He wants to teach Lorelei how to talk, and how to tell him what really happened the afternoon of his wife's death.<br />The book explores one man's grieving process, and how he reacts to those around him.  He becomes a joke at work, and begins a short correspondence with a prison inmate who succeeded in making a dog &quot;talk&quot;.  These scenes were the most disturbing in the book, because as an animal lover, I found it extremely difficult to read.  Thankfully, the scenes are short, and through the experience in the book, Paul realizes that he needs to center himself.  It struck me that Paul's life and work focus on language and communication; yet, he and his wife could have solved a number of problems had they just communicated better with each other.<br />Overall, this book is a great accomplishment. It is especially good when you read it with your dog at your side.	2004-03-04

Edgar encounters many interesting characters, and sees first-hand the amazing culture and people of Burma.  One of my favorite parts of the book was Edgar's tour of the street theatres in Mandalay.<br />Mason's descriptions are lovely, and one can easily imagine the beauty of the setting. Mason actually researched the novel in Burma (modern-day Myanmar) while studying malaria on the border with Thailand.	2004-03-01

Watson's setting, post-war Montana, matched well with his style and tone.

Several chapters are devoted to the history and politics of late-medieval Germany, and they provided wonderful context for the overall story.<br />I learned a great deal from this book, however, the writing style was slightly annoying.  Man, the author, tries to chat with his reader, and while it was interesting some of the time, I felt it was overdone, and that the book began to suffer because of it.  Sentences like &quot;So: Here we go&quot;, do not belong in a history book.  Other than that tendency, I really did like the book.  I am very interested in the History of Books, and this is one of the few sources (in English) written about the father of modern printing; so for that reason, I value it.	2004-02-15

Starting in Scandanavia, he travels around a great deal of the European continent.

Philbrick gives a wonderful description of early 19th-century Nantucket Island, providing a rich context for his recount of the tragedy of the whaleship Essex.  Not only is this story one of adventure, and of great sadness, it is a unforgettable piece of history.  Philbrick gives in-depth sketches of the men from the whaleship, allowing the readers to feel as if they know these men.<br />Superb story, wonderful writing... will not be forgotten.	2004-01-25

However, I was a little disappointed in the writing of this book, finding it straying too far from the intended topic of the history of women's drumming practices.  In recent years, many books have been published with this theme: ancient goddesses, Divine Feminine, etc. I picked up this book because I thought it would offer a completely new angle on ancient practice, yet, I found it repeated things that I have learned in various other publications.  There were a few new insights, as well as very interesting images and pictures to demonstrate how ancient women used their drums, but not the amount of information for which I was hoping.<br />One other qualm I had with this book was the subtitle: A Spiritual History of Rhythm.  When an author attaches this inclusive subtitle to a book, the reader hopes for a survey from many different cultures and continents.  I was disappointed that African rhythm history was altogether ignored in this book, in favor of Asian, and European rhythm history.  African rhythms are some of the most ancient, and the women had a special purpose and place in the development of rhythm and music in Africa.  Why ignore them?  Perhaps Redmond's subtitle should have read: A Spiritual History of Frame Drumming in Europe and Asia.  At least that way, it would have been clear upfront what the reader could expect.<br />Although I have been critical of the overall work, I applaud Redmond's effort to commute her passion and love for drumming and rhythm, as well as her devotion to the Divine.  Reading the book inspired me to pick up her CD, and I am anxious to hear more of her work.	2004-01-18

I was so very impressed with his writing style and his well-crafted story.<br />Assigned to investigate Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, a reporter uncovers an ancient culling spell.  When he learns the power of the spell, and the damage it can do, he sets out with some other very interesting characters, to remove this poem/spell from every library and bookstore in the country.<br />In my opinion, the power of Palahniuk's style is in his use of repeated phrases.  This book was about the power of words and the power of humans to change the world (good and bad).  With words as a central theme in the book, Palahniuk constructs many rhymes and phrases that are mentioned often through the book:<br />\\"Sticks and stones can break your bones, but words will kill you...\\",<br />\\"These noisaholics, these quietophobics...\\"<br />They are very well-placed, and really add to the overall meaning of the story.  The writing was very raw, enough to make me cringe at times, but I still loved the overall story.  This book has definitely opened me up to Palahniuk's writings, and I plan to read his many others in the future.	2004-01-15

Beginning with the illuminated manuscripts of medieval times, he traces the history of illustration and book decoration throughout the centuries.  The design and layout of the book are also discussed in the chapters about bookbinding and typography.  Not only does he address the amazing history of book illustration, but opens the door to the future of art and book design. Comics and graphic novels are given equal face time as the historical manuscripts, as is the experimental art scene in present-day Britain (posters, zines, etc.)<br />Each chapter includes a one-page essay on a certain illustration or design, or about the history of that medium.  The essays are particularly well-written.  My favorites among these essays included Ian Fleming's Bond books and the birth of the paperback, the descriptions on the medieval Book of Hours, and the illustrations of the fairy stories.<br />Beautiful book, and an amazing piece of scholarship.	2004-01-03

Jon Krakauer, the nature/travel journalist, takes on this question in the story of Chris McCandless, who after two years of coast-to-coast travel, was found dead in the Alaskan wildreness.<br />Krakauer retraces McCandless's steps from his childhood to his days at Emory and uncovers a smart, compassionate young man who revelled in the works of Tolstoy, Jack London, and other figures who advocated a simple self-sufficient existence, turning away from money, government, etc.  He interviews several people that Chris, &quot;Alex Supertramp&quot; as he calls himself, met in his hitch hiking travels and discusses his journal writings.  I came upon this book after reading Krakauer's newest book, Under the Banner of Heaven.  I appreciated Krakauer's style of being in the story as an author/journalist, but keeping the story in its purest form.<br />Krakauer first encountered this story after McCandless's death in 1992.  He wrote a feature story in Outside magazine, but was very interested in McCandless, so he decided to research the events more.  This book is the further research.  He provides some insight and answers some of the questions with his own experiences as a mountaineer and outdoor-lover.	2003-12-19

Amazing research and great historical facts. Kurlansky sounds like he had a great time traveling the world for this book's research. What a great job! My only complaint is similar to what the other readers have mentioned--it was pretty lengthy and covered such a large span of history. Then again, salt has been around since the beginning...<br />Salt is something that we take for granted now, but in the past it was so precious it was actually used as a currency. Whomever had the salt had the power.<br />Some of the most interesting parts of the book were when the preservation powers of salt were mentioned: The ancient Celts that were found in Hellein, Austria hundreds of years later in the underground salt mine, preserved down to their brightly-colored kilts!<br />My other favorite part was Chapter 22, about the Dead Sea. I really enjoyed reading about this because I was there in 2000 and was amazed and mystified by the awesome lake, and the areas surrounding it. Unfortunately, the Dead Sea is evaporating at such a rapid rate that geologists are predicting that it may not be around in thirty years, and may even dry up before then. I am glad I was able to see this natural wonder before it was too late.<br />Kurlansky's writing style was great, and I am looking forward to reading his other books... one of them is on my shelf, and this book served as the impetus to pick that one up very soon!	2003-12-09

Unlike any other book that I have ever read (probably the closest is &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot;) At the beginning of the book, Christopher, the fifteen year old narrator states that &quot;This is a murder mystery&quot;, and he is going to be detective, investigating who killed his neighbor's poodle, Wellington. While he is trying to solve the mystery he uncovers many other secrets about his family. Haddon's use of pictures, charts, and graphs really help the reader understand and see through the eyes of Christopher, who has Asperger's disorder or autism (it is never clearly stated). The reader really sympathizes with Christopher's parents and all of the idiosyncracies he has: He hates the colors yellow and brown and will not eat any food that color, or wear any clothes with them; he has a fear of people touching him, and often screams when someone lightly brushes him. There are many other instances in the book where the reader sees that Christopher does love his parents, but he cannot show them because he does not know how to express emotions.	2003-11-26

What a marvelous woman! This is a story that you really want to believe in: the thought of such a strong and brilliant woman living under these extraordinary circumstances... there is nothing like it! Joan was subjugated for so many years by her dreadful father and only a precious few knew of her great skill, yet she was strong at an early age and took her life into her own hands. I really admired Joan's way of integrating her Christian teachings with the logic and reason, as well as the religion of he mother's people. She does not see all of these disciplines and institutions as separate entities, but seems to believe in the power of all of them.<br />The misogyny of this era is not really a surprise or a secret, but reading about it in this narrative style really brings it to light--women were treated so poorly and given no opportunities. What kind of place would the world be today if the women had not been silenced all those thousands of years?	2003-11-17

A fascinating novel about beauty, identity and the way that society sees both.  The story begins with Charlotte Swenson, a woman who left her small-town USA home to become a big city model.  When returning to her hometown (the first time in a number of years) she has a horrific car accident that nearly kills her.  She is badly injured and requires reconstructive surgery to put her face back together.  After 80 titanium screws are put into Charlotte's face, and numerous surgeries and treatments later, she begins to realize how her life has changed, and how things will never be the same.  She returns to New York and is not recognized by her closest friends. She no longer can find work as an aging and drastically changed model.  The whole concept of how beauty affected her work and her social status really intrigued me and kept me reading.  Charlotte herself begins to view people differently, with their true intentions, their \\"shadow self\\" as she terms it.<br />There are many interesting side stories that tie into the larger cohesive novel.  Egan did a great job tying the stories together with the themes of identity and societal norms.  I found the Author's Afterword particularly interesting, and it helped me see the larger picture.  Very interesting read.	2003-11-02

Perhaps my expectations were a little too high after reading Girl with a Pearl Earring (I loved that one!)but I found this one disappointing. Stylistically, I found the Ella parts more well-written. Isabelle's passages were very severe, with these hyphens and the shifting. I never completely grasped her story because I was so put off by the style. On the other hand, I did not particularly like Ella as a person, and Isabelle's personality and her love were &quot;warmer&quot; to read about.<br />As a side note, I loved the library/research parts of the book...I am a librarian and am always happy to see this in the books I read!<br />I am glad that I read this book though, even if it was not all I hoped for.

The writing style flows wonderfully, unlike many other translated books I have read. The characters were so deep and so personal.

The most notable example of this is the dialogue between the various characters... the words he chooses to use and the way that they are written in sentence form are unrealistic.  Real people do not talk this way!  Also, as noted in one of the other reviews, Robin, Dr. Delaware's girlfriend, is a non-entity in the book, appearing at certain junctures, but making no contribution to the story whatsoever.<br />As stated before, the story is interesting, involving the murder of a young girl, and the web of money, sex, and lies that surround her death.  The story was not too predictable either, and that kept me interested.  I may give Kellerman another chance... hopefully it will be a little better.	2003-09-05

I knew next to nothing about Captain James Cook when i picked up this audiobook... history books generally glass over his voyages, even though he explored an area that encompasses nearly 1/3 of the globe! Horwitz's urge to learn all he could about the man and his work is infectious... you can see this in the text rubbing off on those around him, as seen in Roger, his companion on many of his \\"Cook\\" travels.<br />Retracing Captain Cook's three voyages, relying heavily on the diaires of Cook himself, Horwitz decides to take a short trip to the Pacific Northwest to sail for 10 days in a replica of Cook's ship. He wanted a feel for the life or a seaman, and he sure gets it!! Next he sets off to Australia and New Zealand. His journalistic style brings in great aspects of history, anthropology, and language. He interviews Maori people in New Zealand and Aborigines in Australia, asking them what memories their people have of Cook and his men. Both groups remember Captain Cook, oftentimes in a negative light. It does not appear that they despise Cook as a man, but more of what he stood for, and what his exploration meant for the native culture.<br />Horwitz and Roger then begin to island hop around the Pacific. I particularly liked the time they spent on the island of Niue (like Horwitz, I had never heard of this island!) Describing the scene, Horwitz claims it may be the last part of Polynesia that is not spoiled by commercialism and tourists. He and Roger stay for a week on this small island (only 11 miles long!) and try to unravel the mystery of the hula hula (Cook's men were scared away from these islands by men with red teeth, and they named the island Savage Island because they thought the people were cannibals).<br />Roger and Horwitz go to Yorkshire England, Cook's birthplace (and Roger's too), and take part in a few days of the Cook festival. They meet Cliff, the young president of the Captain Cook society, and try to find out as much as they can about the enigmatic Cook. Going to Cook's own home gives Horwitz a different take on the man, and he learns more about Cook's beliefs and his philosophies.<br />Their travels end in Hawaii, like Cook's did in 1778. They commemorate Cook on the beach where he was killed.<br />I learned a great deal from this book. Polynesian history and culture is drastically overlooked in America. People travel to Hawaii for its sandy beaches, but have no idea about the history of its great people. Horwitz's observation about the vastness and homogenous nature of Polynesian culture was astounding to me. The people of Tonga and Niue had similar rituals, and the islanders of Hawaii, thousands of miles away had many of the same customs. This makes Polynesian culture and ethnicity more expansive than any other.<br />The other aspect of this book that fascinated me was how Horwitz tried to get into Cook's head. Cook was a son of the Enlightenment, and did not come to Polynesia with preconceived notions of God, Gold, and Glory like the conquistadors. He wanted to discover and learn about others, and was very scientifically conscious for a man of his time.tic Cook.

When I finished that story, I was very curious for more details. Angel of Darkness picks up soon after the previous case, and the action begins almost immediately. This story is narrated by the teenage Stevie Taggert, the street kid that Dr. Kriezler has taken in, and saved from a life of crime. A Spanish diplomat's child is kidnapped in public, and the mother sees her daughter a few days later on a train. She is not able to confront the woman, and soon enlists the services of Sarah Howard, who has started an investigation service. In a short amount of time, Sarah reassumbles the group and they pinpoint the suspect as Elsbeth Hunter. Yet, the deeper they dig into the woman's past, the more they discover of the hideousness nature of her crimes. With her many aliases, Elsbeth has traveled around New York kidnapping, and killing children.<br />Like the previous book, there were some cameos with great historical figures. Teddy Roosevelt makes a special appearance, this time as the Assistant Secratary of the Navy. Another historical figure that plays a small part in the story is Clarence Darrow (pre-Monkey Trial) when he defends Mrs. Hunter (or Hatch, or Frasier, Franklin... whichever name she decides to use!).<br />Carr is a gifted storyteller, and his books are hard to put down. I love the glimpses of early 20th century New York life. Stevie's narration of the story was a nice touch, and I appreciated seeing it from his vantage point. Other readers have said that this does not compare to The Alienist, but personally I thought it was a very good follow-up.	2003-08-18

I really enjoyed this book and was disappointed to see such an abrupt ending... but not so much so that I cannot give the overall story 5 stars.<br />My favorite sections of the book were when Pi lived in India and described his life and his fascination with religion. I so much enjoyed the descriptions of the three religions that Pi practiced: Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam. I loved how Pi did not see the three as mutually exclusive.<br />The \\"meat\\" of the story comes when Pi is shipwrecked and lives for 227 days on a 26-foot life boat with an adult Bengal tiger, named Richard Parker. At first he deathly afraid of the carnivore, and begins to plot how he can kill the tiger. I was so happy to see Pi accept Richard Parker's existence, and realize that he needed him there in order to keep himself alive.<br />Like I mentioned above, the end wrapped up quickly, I could have seen the story go quite a but further. Yet, I loved the overall tale...It read very quickly and was much like a fable mixed in with elements of \\"Worst Case Scenario\\".	2003-08-13

After the death of a prominent man in Oxford, a young servant girl is accused of murder. Each of the four stories revolves around the trial of the servant girl, and the events leading to the death of the doctor.<br />Pears weaves a mystery with intriguing narrators: Marco da Cola, the Venetian doctor who appears in Oxford for no particular reason; Jack Prescott, the son of an accused traitor, who is trying to clear his family's name; John Wallis, a cryptographer and archivist; and Anthony Wood, a scholar historian.<br />I particularly enjoyed the characters of da Cola and Sarah Blundy. How I wish we could have heard her side of the tale!<br />A wonderful work that was a pleasure to hear (I had the audiobook). The reader performed particularly well, and I found myself immersed in the characters with the many accents that he used.	2003-08-13

Also noteworthy, the translation of the text from the German is very good.<br />A book that makes you very aware of your nose and your sense of smell...

Everyone asks themselves this question... no matter where you are in your life's journey, it is a question that arises.  Many of the stories were very inspiring, little bits that you remember through the day... some were definitely better than others.<br />I bought the audiobook format which was perfect for my commute to work.  The worst thing about the audiobook? Mr. Bronson tries to imitate his interviewees in the recording, and I found his accents quite annoying... the overall story was very good, but the delivery made me cringe!  Sorry Po--stick to the writing, not the recording!<br />Other than this flaw, I found the book enjoyable and inspiring.  It gives you a sense of empowerment and inspiration.	2003-08-04

He wants to study at Harvard Divinity School for one year to improve his perspective on world religions, and add depth and knowledge to his articles concerning religion for the newspaper. When he arrives at Harvard, in the mid-1980s, he is surprised to find an eclectic mix of students, from all the major religions, debating about major issues of the day. His view of Harvard's Divinity school as uppity, straight-laced ministers is challenged with every new student he meets.<br />Goldman discusses his own religious life and spiritual memoirs. A yeshiva-educated Orthodox Jew, Goldman struggled in college with his career interests and his religious training. How could one keep kosher in a foreign country? How could one keep Sabbath when a huge news story breaks?<br />There are chapters in the book describing the major religions and the courses that Goldman took at the Divinity School to help him understand each. There are also chapters discussing Women in Religion, Orthodoxy, and other issues that modern religions encounter.<br />Goldman's writing style is very readable (no doubt because of his journalism background) and he writes with spirit. He does not hesitate to discuss trials and struggles that the people at the Divinity School have, or things that he struggles with himself.	2003-08-03

I could not wait to find out what was going to happen to Tempe. I liked the narrator too--she really developed the accents in her reading. Since most of the characters were southerners with the drawl, she read their voices that way. One of the prominent characters was also Canadian, and she used an accent for his readings too. I liked that little touch, it made it seem more authentic.<br />After hearing this book, I will look into more of Kathy Reichs books!	2003-07-24

After a seredipitous find of a genizah in his friend's basement, he creates this phenomenal story--weaving elements of history, religion, mystery, and tragedy.<br />Berekiah is a secret Jew in 16th century Portugal. His family professed that they converted and were \\"New Christians\\" after 1492, but they continued their Jewish customs and traditions. When his world is turned upside down by the death of his beloved uncle, Berekiah sets out to find the murderer. With the \\"Old Christians\\" marauding the streets of Lisbon, killing many Jews and plundering their possessions, Berekiah and his best friend, Farid, search for answers. Only someone who intimately knew Uncle Abraham could have killed him, and Berekiah searches for the killer amongst his own friends and loved ones, the inner circle of \\"threshers\\", fellow secret Jews that studied Kabbalah with his uncle.<br />Berekiah tells the story in first person narrative, and I felt that we were not able to learn very much about him because of this. We learn more about his family and the inner circle of threshers than we do about him. The story is also told in present tense, so it is very easy to get steeped and feel like you are right there with Berekiah and Farid.<br />I enjoyed this book very much and I learned a great deal about Marrano history.	2003-07-21

It is the story of a young German-Jewish boy during WWII. The story is told through the young man's eyes, as he tries to figure out who the Nazis are, his family's hiding, their concentration camp days, and his life afterwards. The book is told in two parts, after young Moishe decides he wants to hide his Jewish identity, he assumes the name Danny, and calls himself a gypsy. A sweet story about returning to love. The story is simple, and seems to be geared towards children/young teens, but adult readers will be able to enjoy the book just as much.	2003-07-18

The convent scenes were also well-written, and I found myself very interested in the lives of these nuns. There were so many good things about the book, although there were a few sections of the book that I was unclear of what was going on, and what it had to do with the overall story...

It is a coming of age story, and the main character, Nicola, writes journals about her friends, and her feelings. I enjoyed the book, and I felt that the author did a terrific job in identifying with the age group.	2003-07-18

Everyone is saying this has the distinct voice of To Kill a Mockingbird and it really is very similar. The story is not really like Mockingbird but the narrative perspective is told in the same way by Evelyn Bucknow. The book covers eight years of Evelyn's adolescence--from 10 years onto her graduation from high school. Her mother is constantly trying to make ends meet financially, and she loves Evelyn deeply. There is a great schism in the family because Tina, Evelyn's mother, had her out of wedlock. Tina's parents are extreme fundamentalists that will not let her forget her past. When Tina becomes pregnant again with a married man's baby, the problems start all over again, and Evelyn's grandmother, Eileen, is the only family that will talk to them.<br />Evelyn's brother, Samuel, is born prematurely and it is soon obvious that he is mentally handicapped. Tina's role in the book changes to constant caretaker of Samuel, and Evelyn moves into her teenage years nearly alone. Her grandmother begins taking her to church, and Evelyn finds some answers there... yet she struggles with questions when one of her favorite teachers in school, Ms. Jenkins, becomes the target of a smear campaign by the fundamentalists for teaching evolution to the children. Evelyn's struggle to decide whether to side with her grandmother and the \\"nice people at the church\\" or her teacher shows exactly how Evelyn is certainly in the center of everything.<br />The Center of Everything brings together many situations that Evelyn must confront--and she is a strong girl who has a very wise voice for someone so young.	2003-07-18

This book was recommended to me by a friend a few months ago, and I came across it serendipitously.  I was eager to read it after looking at the cover's synopsis, and the catchy title. I was so very impressed with Miss Winner's knowledge of language, sacred texts, etc. She completely opens her soul in this book, and it was fascinating to see inside someone like that. I highly enjoyed the word origins, and the history of holidays (both Christian and Jewish), and her commentary on every aspect of spirituality.<br />Many characters were introduced in the book, and I had a hard time remembering everyone when they were mentioned again dozens of pages later. I did feel a little disjointed with all the skipping around, things did not come in chronological order. One minute she is teaching class at shul, then she is at Oxford, already converted into Christianity, steeped in Anglican teaching.<br />I do appreciate the great amount of knowledge and intellect that Lauren Winner brings to the field. After reading this book, it is as if you are good friends with her, and you know so much about her life and her daily struggles. Although the ending is abrupt, I liked how she returned to certain parts of her upbringing, and built up her library again.<br />I look forward to other books by Lauren Winner.	2003-07-18

I really enjoyed reading this book. At the end of every chapter I found myself saying, \\"That was my favorite one!\\" but then I would read the next one... and I just could not choose! I think I learned the most from the first few chapters, regarding Columbus and the European \\"settlement\\" of America, but every chapter had such extensive bibliography and footnotes, so the learning never stopped! I was blown away by the facts that the textbooks leave out.	2003-07-18

This book revolves around the central thesis that literacy and the alphabet reconfigured the human brain, and subsequently brought serious changes into human culture: religion, history, etc. The oldest religions worshipped the Mother Goddess figure, yet, when reading and writing came into the picture (roughly 5000-4000 BCE) the supremacy of the female deity faded, and the male deities became more and more prominent. Shlain traces this fundamental change throughout history... a phenomenal book that has caused controversy thus far (I am sure more is to come!)<br />This book covers so many things, and teaches you so much. Not a dull moment at all with this one!	2003-07-18

I enjoyed this book because it shouwed how smart some of these spies were, and were able to stay under the radar for so long, and then strike so fast. The book categorizes spies (like &quot;Moles&quot;, or &quot;Cryptographers&quot;) and gives a lengthy biography on each spy. It is amazing that the reporter that wrote this book was able to gather all the information on people that strove to be invisible! A fascinating read about the world of espionage.	2003-07-18

It caught my eye because it was by Steve Martin, and it was not what I was expecting, nonetheless, it was entertaining.

The book centers around the &quot;re-education&quot; of two young men during the Cultural Revolution in China. One is the son of a successful dentist who &quot;dewormed&quot; Mao's teeth, and the other is the son of a pulminary specialist. Because both boys were educated in western style before the regime, they are singled out, along with other fortunate sons to be re-educated in the mountains with the peasants. They work very long days in the fields, learning the ways of the worker. They befriend a young mountain girl, the Little Seamstress, and experience first love. They also meet another boy being re-educated that has a secret suitcase full of Western literature. The young men read every bit of this contraband material they can get their hands on.<br />It is a wonderful story about the love of literature, and the struggles of growing up. It is a short book (only 170 pages or so) and has been a bestseller for months. It reminds you just how wonderful reading is.	2003-07-18

He writes with such a deep emotion, and I love his characters. I liked Gershon's Kabbalistic studies and how they coincided with the images of light throughout the book. I think this book was spurred by many of Potok's own experiences as a war chaplain in Korea.<br />I am glad I was able to read it... anything by Potok is beautiful!	2003-07-18

After reading and got a book from the library of da Vinci's paintings and found exactly what Brown refers to! This book spans religion, history, literature, crypotography... it is just amazing.

The Holy Man lives on a hill and people from every surrounding village, and some from even farther, come to ask his advice on every matter. There are small chapters of about 4 pages that introduce some of the pilgrims that have made their way to the Holy Man's house. The advice and words he dispenses are beautiful amd sometimes humorous.	2003-07-18

I had a great appreciation for the time that went into writing the book and the little details about the Greek language (I too labored in Greek college courses--but no bacchanals for me!) I had a hard time figuring out what time this book took place in--one minute it sounded like the 60s, then maybe the 70s? I finally just thought it might be the 80s. It was just a little disorienting... Other than that slightly irksome feature, I did enjoy the book. The characters were unlikable, but they were supposed to be... I think!	2003-07-18

Dan Brown has an interesting way of doing that! Robert Langdon is a great character--sometimes his feats seem a little too extraordinary, but they are still fun to read about.<br />I found the Illuminati history interesting, as well as the discussions about the art and symbology.<br />Overall a pretty good book, but DaVinci Code still is my favorite!	2003-07-17

One of them takes place in modern-day Lisbon and follows the investigation of a murdered teenager. The other story starts in Germany during WWII. The stories finally converge around page 400, but by this time I had already become bored with the WWII story, and found myself skimming the chapters, wanting to get back to the modern story. But, by the time the stories did converge, I thought the outcome was good. I thought it was a great mystery/suspense novel.<br />I am looking forward to other books by Wilson.

It covers the Biblical lands from their early beginnings, into the Bronze and Iron Ages, and ends with the Roman Period.
