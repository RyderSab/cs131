It is ironic that Touchwood, published in 1991 and presaging Karin Kallmaker's vast range in her so-called \\"formula\\" romances, is still as needed today as it was 15 years ago. <br /> <br />The whole underlying point of the novel, aside from a sexy, entertaining tale of a young woman's search for romance, is that young woman's - and the reader's - coming to understand what life was like for those lesbians who came before her. She is falling in love with one of those pioneers, a lesbian who survived the closets, stereotypes and vicious social stigmas of the 50s, 60s and 70s.  <br /> <br />Rayann, a creature of the gay 90s where it was possible to have - and want! -- nothing but lesbian friends, and hang out only in lesbian places, just doesn't \\"get\\" why Louisa, her senior by 26 years, was ever in the closet. Doesn't \\"get\\" Louisa's stomping butch best friend, Danny, who was butch and not gonna hide it even during times when not wearing 3 items of women's clothing could get you arrested. Rayann doesn't \\"get\\" why Louisa would pretend to be femme for her lesbian social circle, because that is what her social circle demanded of her, since she was a mother.  <br /> <br />In one wonderful, telling exchange, Rayann even asks Louisa how she could stand living that way. Louisa's reply is forthright: she was as safe and out as she could possibly be, living under those strictures with a young chlid, living an unheard of dream of a shared life with her first long-term love, helped by friends she loved and needed. There was nothing to \\"stand.\\" She was *happy* in a world determined not to let her even exist.  <br /> <br />So today, 15 years after this novel was penned, we have a reader who doesn't \\"get\\" how Rayann could be attracted to Louisa as anything but a mother figure. Doesn't \\"get\\" the metaphors about how stereotypes both within and outside the community have shaped our identity. Doesn't even \\"get\\" how 15 years ago Rayann was happily surrounded with her lesbian world, like that's a bad thing! Rayann's immersion into the out and proud gay 90s is what keeps Rayann from seeing that not everybody gets to live that way, challenging her to find empathy.  <br /> <br />More ironically, this reader doesn't \\"get\\" that Louisa's absent voice in this novel is a reflection of how society renders women over 50 sexless and voiceless. As Rayann learns Louisa's history, she sees Louisa more and more clearly. And we the readers can follow that same journey of learning and exploration. Unless, of course, a reader just doesn't \\"get\\" it. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, that reader didn't stick around for the payoff, the delightful turn of events when Rayann discovers that she can barely keep up with Louisa in bed, and comes to realize that Louisa is, simply, a Woman of Quality. Vital, sexual, intelligent, committed, loyal - Louisa is a catch-and-a-half for the vastly less experienced Rayann, not the other way around.  <br /> <br />Rayann's subsequent feelings of inferiority become another interesting theme in the book, and in short stories written after the close of this novel, and its heart-breaking, soaring sequel Watermark, it is plain that Louisa deepened and enriched Rayann's life and character immeasurably. (I do advise anyone who reads and loves Touchwood to let some time pass before reading Watermark. It's devastating at times, and at others, funny and romantic in different ways.) <br /> <br />When I first read Touchwood I identified with Rayann. My copy was growing tattered and so I was pleased to acquire a new copy with a beautiful new cover when it was reissued. I laughed all over again in the scene when Rayann, mending her broken heart early on, seems to find herself noticing every single woman she sees. I have been there in my life, when the light on a stocking-clad leg or a bare shoulder stopped me in my tracks with appreciation for how beautiful all women can be.  <br /> <br />In my recent re-reading, all these years later, I identified with Louisa's silent strength and her attempt to resist her love for Rayann, believing that as a woman of 56, she did not deserve the love of the much younger woman. That is a *lot* to get from a so-called formula romance, that spoke to me all those years ago and speaks to me again, even though I and society have changed.  <br /> <br />This was and IS a phenomonal book about age, society and ageism, from a writer then only 31 herself. It's also an entertaining, humorous romance with a wonderful, uplifting ending. 5 stars seems inadequate, but it's the most I can give! <br />	2005-05-26

When I pick up the latest novel by Karin Kallmaker, I am always ready to let her have her way with me, in the literary sense. After reading All the Wrong Places, I think I'm ready in nearly every sense! <br /> <br />Having read this book nearly three weeks ago, I am still trying to figure out how Kallmaker can write such a graphic, erotic tale and still infuse it with innocence, hope and good, clean fun. There are toys and situations a-plenty, but not once did I pause to think \\"is that even possible?\\" or \\"isn't that going to hurt for days?\\" or -- as happens in some \\"lesbian\\" erotica -- \\"what's *he* doing there?!\\" <br /> <br />All the Wrong Places is a sweet, well-told romance about two young women who don't have a clue how to get from \\"this week\\" to \\"forever.\\" It's also a highly-charged story of sweaty, real lesbian sex. Perhaps the magic is in how the book opens with a casual, steamy encounter with a woman Brandy will never see again, but closes with a scene between Brandy and Tess that is so tender that the explicit description of what they're doing fades into the background. All I cared about was that they had clearly found the most erotic territory of all: hot sex with the woman you love. Only in re-reading did I truly appreciate how very hot that final scene was as a standalone piece of erotica! <br /> <br />With Maybe Next Time, Kallmaker had me holding my breath in pain and sorrow, in One Degree of Separation holding my breath with anticipation of the next laugh. All the Wrong Places had me holding my breath in pure anticipation of the next moment of eroticism or romance, or both at once as so wonderfully conveyed by one of our most gifted storytellers. Karin Kallmaker strikes all the RIGHT places with me in this book, and I can hardly wait for her next work in this new \\"after dark\\" genre.  <br /> <br />	2004-11-29

Other reviewers are right -- there isn't really anything like the Honor series out there and when I want to escape into a fast-paced action world, I will pick up the Honor books to take me away. I am glad the author revised this book (though it irritates to buy multiple versions of the same work in the same way that it irritates to have bought a DVD only to discover a short time later that a \\"director's cut\\" is going to be released) because this version *is* better than the first. I think it reflects a new artist's creative energy honing itself over time. Let's face it, some of our best writers in romance have gotten better over time, especially those with a number of books already produced and more on the way. <br />Since the other reviews of this book are accurate I didn't see a point to adding my 5 stars, but I was surprised that anyone would suggest that if I happen to like another writer then I haven't read Radclyffe. Well, I have read Rad, plus lots of other writers. I see no reason to pick between them, or refuse all others just because I might have a favorite. That's just plain silly. Rad isn't my favorite, sorry my heart belongs to another, but she's on the list of writers I will *always* buy, and that's a pretty short list.<br />Given the struggles of our bookstores and publishers and writers today I think everybody should buy as many books by as many writers as they can afford. Why be exclusive? I think it's great to have a number of talented writers in the romance genre, each giving different flavors. Radclyffe writes an action-thriller-romance-sexy tale with a blend that is all her own (and this series is the best example of that) and sets her apart from the banal. Other writers do what they do in their own way equally well. If you limit yourself to just one writer you're missing out on some great books and wonderful entertainment.	2004-05-16

As I make my way through Radclyffe's books I find myself enjoying nearly every page. There really are only a few lesbian writers out there who deliver such solid, consistent entertainment. Radclyffe has a niche all her own within the romance world, with characters who are knowledgable, valiant and exceptionally moral. <br />The women in Passion's Bright Fury are saved from being unbelievable paragons by their powerful attraction to other women, which humanizes them, well, for the most part. We may not be these women, or even know women like them, but we really do hope women like them exist somewhere!<br />Radclyffe is also a professional and there is no sloppy prose or unnecessary scenes to slow down solid, action-packed pacing. When it comes to the action-romance the list of good, consistent writers is short indeed, and Radclyffe, for me, sits very near the top, if not in the #1 slot. Given how great her action pacing is, I am hoping she someday turns her talents to fantasy or sci-fi.	2004-05-16

It's the library where I wish I'd spent all my youth though. Imagine going to the library and there at the desk is this cute, sweet, honest, knowledgeable, kind, OUT LESBIAN there to answer your every question. I would have asked *this* Marian the Librarian where to find the girls-who-like-girls book, let me tell you. <br />This book was like a fantasy come to life. All my life I have had the hots for librarians. I think it's because Barbara Gordon was a librarian -- you know, BATGIRL! I laughed a lot and really felt like if I went to Iowa City I'd find Marian and Liddy drinking coffee, along with the rest of the gals. No telling who'd be with whom by then, except Marian and Liddy -- they're meant for each other. Wouldn't I like to be a fly on the wall for their sex life!<br />I did not think that Karin Kallmaker could come up with a heroine that was sexier than the savagely intelligent, tormented, motorcycle riding Reyna, but Marian flipped all my lights to green.

The reviews said it was funny and romantic and I'd laugh my head off. Yes, it was sexy, yes it was humorous -- but where was the romance? A series of mishaps, peccadilloes and professions of love do not a lesbian romance novel make.<br />I found Macy so intent on being New York cool that she was thoroughly unlikeable. I wouldn't want her for a friend -- but then I don't want any of the women on Sex in the City for friends either. I'd want to know of them, about them, but I don't want to date them, and not one of them is someone I could ever envision settling down with! Macy is like that too. The whole point of reading a romance novel is falling in love with the main character. Macy made me laugh and made me hot, but it wasn't love. <br />Expectations are everything, and I guess if you read this book expecting a sex romp like Sex in the City (as another reviewer suggested) you'll like it. I can see it being nominated for humor, or as general fiction. This book succeeds really well as a funny novel, a farce and even as a gentle satire of the romance genre. But if held up to the standard of a romance novel (which is what I thought I was buying) it fails.<br />I read a romance novel to vicariously enjoy the courtship of a couple. Up to a point, this book has that. But Macy's changes are not convincing enough for me to think she'll stay sober. For Faith and Macy to survive as a couple, Macy has to deal with her alcoholism *realistically.* Many fine romance novels have taken this theme. But Sawyer fails to make Macy's so-called cure include dealing with the real reasons she self-medicates with alcohol (and it's not just lack of AA meetings!). It's insulting to everyone who has ever struggled with an addiction to suggest that conquering it can be done through merely making up one's mind and fueled by \\"the power of real love\\". What is funny in a tongue-in-cheek sex romp that might provide sequels and more romps andamusements removes all of the hope from a romance novel.<br />In a real world -- which is where all lesbian romance novels finally must dwell for a reader to be satisfied -- Macy will relapse and Faith will end up used and belittled like everyone else Macy's ever slept with and thrown up on. If this is a \\"romance\\" genre novel, it's a well-written failure. So why did that label get attached to it in the first place? <br />This is probably not the writer's fault at all. Sawyer may not have felt she was writing a \\"romance,\\" but that's how this book is being marketed by her publisher. Why? If it's not serious enough to be \\"real literature\\" let's label it romance --regardless of the tenets of the genre -- because everyone knows romances aren't \\"literature\\"? Do the Lammy people think the romance category is merely \\"fiction light\\"? That's like saying any novel with a murder must be a mystery, even if the mystery is never investigated or solved.<br />Lesbian romance novels are a unique genre, and I've read, studied and analyzed hundreds. They vary widely in their stories -- some writers go far outside the accepted boundaries by dealing with heavy subjects like abuse and addiction -- but ultimately they all have one thing in common: the two women end up together, with a realistic hope of forever. And there is no way Macy and Faith have forever if Macy doesn't stay sober. I really don't know what the Lammy people --and her publisher! -- are thinking in misbilling this book. It would have been far more nervey to *not* label it romance, and let readers and critics alike enjoy the book without false expectations. I'm not saying it doesn't deserve to win a Lammy, it should be in the correct category -- fiction. But apparently that category is reserved for \\"serious\\" books and Sawyer wrote a book far too funny to be considered there. <br />Sawyer has written what I know most people will find funny and entertaining. I did enjoy it. I just didn't find the novel any more \\"romantic\\" than I do Sex in the City. Those of us who love the show don't want any of the ladies to change, and, be honest, would you believe it if any of them said they'd found sobriety and happy forever after? No -- you want the show to go on. I think that's what Sawyer intended as the feeling for this book. So it's a shame her publisher pigeonholed it with a label that made me expect a very different, more convincing conclusion.	2004-01-27

The book has been nominated for a Lammy in the romance category and it deserves to win.<br />Maybe some people find it hard because it's real. No sugar coating. Sabrina Starling is deeply wounded. Her life has been seemingly magical but fate has been abruptly cruel. Sabrina, petrified she has lost her ability to play the violin, does something cruel herself, but it's not fate that gets hurt, but real women.<br />Sabrina's despair about not just her violin but her own actions is intensely moving. Can she somehow find a way to make amends? When you actually believe that you deserve the bad things that have happened to you, how can you possibly find happiness and love?<br />Karin Kallmaker made me believe it. I couldn't stop reading. Tears running down my cheeks at times, I ached for Sabrina to heal, to find her way back to her music, love and passion. <br />Nobody who reads with an open mind and open heart can't be moved by Sabrina's final confrontation with her losses and how she lets go of the most precious thing in her life in order to move on. I could feel the sea spray on my face.<br />What a great book. Karin Kallmaker surprises me every time.	2004-01-27
US	45822932	R2BV8UIHWII635	1931513260	700493592	Maybe Next Time	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Rich and Breathtaking	Karin Kallmaker's latest novel spans 40 years of Sabrina Starling's life. Told in both present events and flashback, it chronicles Bree's rise to stardom as a concert violnist and her fall into an abyss of despair when her ability to play is lost. <br />There is a mystery at the heart of this story: why can't Bree play? If the answer is age or, as is common with many musicians, carpal tunnel syndrome, then Bree's inability to cope or get at least a measure of comfort from her gift is immature. But the reason for her loss is nowhere near that simple, and unraveling the cause of Bree's agony is what this book is about. <br />Along the way there is some exceptional prose about the power of music, the escape of sex and the frustration of love gone wrong. The encounter between teenaged Bree and the love-of-her-life Jorie, also a teenager, is one of the best I've ever read about first times between young adult women. It's poignant and erotic and completely realistic. <br />In our journey with Bree we discover which of her wounds are accidents and which are self-inflicted, and as the book closes we see a moving portrayal of a woman healing and trying to atone for the many mistakes she has made along the way. Loss, tragedy, ecstasy, atonement and a real chance for happiness: to me that is good reading.<br />So many books set in Hawaii (as this book primarily is) dwell on the beautiful beaches, the smiling people, and the easy pace of life. Kudos to Kallmaker for digging deeper into the island culture with the rich addition of Hawaiian spirituality as shown in Bree's struggles with her own ancestors. Ancestors often know what is best for us, especially when we do not. The trick is -- as Bree discovers -- listening to your ancestors in time. Sometimes Bree listens, other times she does not. <br />This isn't the kind of intense two-character romantic tale that Kallmaker pens so well (and I really do hope she pens again!) but it is one of the best books I've read this year. Erotic, believable, heartbreaking and breathtaking, I read it the first time at a breathless pace to discover Bree's story, then I read it again much more slowly to savor the quality of Kallmaker's prose and the skill with which she spun such a captivating tale of a lesbian life. <br />I am eagerly awaiting what promises to be a much lighter read in her &quot;One Degree of Separation.&quot; I think it's marvelous that she can -- if I let her -- take me just about anywhere she wants with the exceptional gift of her storytelling.<br />Don't miss this book -- and I completely agree with another reviewer. This story ought to be a movie.	2003-10-07

Like Knight, Warshawsky is a tough cookie who can hurt, a smart woman who makes human mistakes, and a real pain... for friends who wish she wouldn't get herself into such danger.<br />Paretsky's gift in storytelling is the way she takes a small incident and lets it mushroom until seemingly unrelated incidents form the picture of a larger, uglier tale.

At first I thought her reticence was intriguing, but after a dozen books with no sign of a human side, I was beginning to find it pathological. I wanted more humanity and compassion for herself from Kinsey. Finally, this books delivers it.<br />The past is the downfall of many tough women detectives. My current new favorite, Mickey Knight from the talented pen of JM Redmann, has a past no one would want and only the strong can survive. Same, too, with Kinsey, but both Grafton and Redmann are too good to make such a character device a mere tool. Grafton, having so many books in print, has done a fine job of burying the hints to Kinsey's past and in this book allows most of them to surge up, but the hints come together in a surprising way, one I simply did not expect. Truthfully, her reticence WAS pathological. And now we know why.<br />I'm hooked all over again.	2002-02-27

And glad to be. <br />After reading The Drive I'm convinced that what poetry there is in the movie came from Todd's undeniably poetic soul. The Drive is an invitation to journey while a woman tells you about her secrets, her soul, her ideals and her dreams. Rather than self-absorbed, her observations have more universality than anything &quot;Claire&quot; achieved. It's not an actress on acting or a writer on writing, or even a lesbian on what it's like being a lesbian.

I, too, don't understand the time setting of the novel, and it seems increasingly clear to me that Brown doesn't have a real grasp on what coming out was like for women who aren't *gasp* breathtakingly beautiful, surrounded by wealth and opportunity, and don't have the pickings of any of the *gasp* breathtakingly beautiful women around them. I found Vic to be manipulative and unlikeable on many levels. She feels pressured to save her family fortunes by marrying a rich man (in 1980, not 1950. Vic doesn't even come close to convincing me anything more than her vanity and desire to continue being wealthy is at stake. <br />Truthfully, though many people just can't conceive that a mere small press lesbian romance novel could compare to anything by Rita Mae, I recommend Karin Kallmaker's Substitute for Love to anyone who wants to see what it's like when a character is convincingly forced to reject her lesbian soul to save her family.<br />The families are daft, which is vintage Rita Mae, but not in the delightful way that Six of One conveyed.

I sincerely believe that if Mickey Knight were straight and as lusty about men as she is about women, JM Redmann would be a household name across the country. The writing is top grade; never once did I have to tell myself, \\"yeah, that's awkward, but at least it's lesbian\\" to forgive some sort of flaw. The plotting is terrific and the characters multi-dimensional. Redmann conveys the fecund rotting mouldering exhuberant reality of New Orleans as an character of its own, while race, class and gender politics are woven so neatly into the story there is never a moment of feeling preached to.<br />Mickey is one of those characters that will always surprise the reader. She's not the straight arrow that Paretsky's VI Warshawsky is, nor the morally bankrupt Sam Spade. She's certainly not the brilliant Mary from Laurie King's Sherlock Holmes' tales and not the relentlessly physical Energizer bunny type of detective that populates almost all mysteries and thrillers these days. Mickey Knight is unique. No mystery fan -- lesbian or otherwise -- should miss the pure entertainment of JM Redmann's series.	2002-01-26

If the uber elements are going to work better then I want less normal everyday world.	2002-01-26

Having not thought much of the self-absorbed storyline in &quot;Claire of the Moon&quot; (movie or novelization, take your pick) I didn't think I'd think much of Trisha Todd's memoir which included a great deal about the behind-the-scenes elements of &quot;Claire.&quot;<br />I was wrong. And glad to be.<br />After reading The Drive I'm convinced that what poetry there is in the movie came from Todd's undeniably poetic soul. The Drive is an invitation to journey while a woman tells you about her secrets, her soul, her ideals and her dreams. Rather than self-absorbed, her observations have more universality than anything &quot;Claire&quot; achieved. It's not an actress on acting or a writer on writing, or even a lesbian on what it's like being a lesbian. It's about a woman, journeying through a broad spectrum of life.<br />I'm glad I got in the car. I wish the journey had been longer.	2002-01-26

Carr has a truly romantic style. Unlike many of the other uber writers, she has dared to give her two characters family to surround them, and she writes convincingly of the family relationships (though the bad characters can be a bit one-dimensional at times).<br />Unfortunately, at times the decision to have a family presence conflicts in a jarring way with the thriller part of the story. Carr placed her heroines in a real world with very human surroundings, and therefore when they are shot at or get into involved fights it just doesn't ring true with the &quot;normal&quot; world that drives the romantic plot.<br />The romantic plot really is pleasing, and I'm glad I read it for that reason.	2002-01-07

I was really caught up in the fast-paced opening of this uber novel and I enjoyed the ride for the duration of the book. It's an very good first novel and I look forward to more from Talaran.<br />I enjoyed it enough to want to point out a few technique flaws that I think can be easily fixed with practice and good editing. For example, in the excerpt available on this page, the scene is from Nic's point of view -- it's not omniscent. We start with Nic, we have only Nic's inner monologue, presented with care and detail. Suddenly, we get a snippet from Carly's point of view, then back to Nic. Oops, back to Carly for a paragraph about how beautiful Nic is, then Nic again. The point of view flip-flops are surprising and jerky. It feels like a third-person limited point of view then we slip momentarily into another mind. If it's third-person shared point of view then Carly needs as much presence as Nic. The writer needs to choose one point of view for the scene. It would be just as flawed if, for example, a one-paragraph snip from a lurking villian's mind was also included. <br />The sample here also has something that is just driving me crazy in uber books. We're in Nic's point of view. Nic does not think of herself as &quot;the dark haired woman.&quot; Therefore every occurrence of the phrase is a point of view violation and it gets very old, very fast. It's adds nothing to character or plot.<br />If Carly has just met her, and we're legitimately in Carly's point of view and she thinks of Nic that way that's fine. But there's no way Nic's point of view would present a detail like, &quot;the dark haired woman smiled&quot; when referring to herself! Given the point of view, it made me wonder what dark-haired woman Nic was talking about. Instead of this already tired phrase, what about telling us exactly what kind of smile Nic gave Carly and what's she's feeling as they walk? <br />If I hadn't liked the book I wouldn't take the time to give what I hope are helpful critiques. I am looking forward to Talaran's next effort -- and I hope that her editors give her a little more of their expertise next time around.	2002-01-07

Montague's &quot;A Wild Sea&quot; made me think of &quot;Watermark,&quot; Kallmaker's sequel to &quot;Touchwood.&quot; <br />Montague is tackling complicated issues of life itself, in the way that Kallmaker does in her atypical &quot;romance&quot; novels. Montague's writing isn't yet the same soul-stirring, heart-pounding prose that Kallmaker manages, but I applaud the effort and I just plain want more. I've given it the same number of stars as &quot;Touchwood,&quot; but in truth it is not quite as spectacular, but 4 stars just seemed inadequate when I've given many books weaker than this 4 stars because they showed promise or were pleasing in other ways.<br />I'm glad to see that this book is a bit longer than &quot;A Wild Sea&quot; because the hard stuff of life takes more time to write about and deserves more depth of character. I sincerely hope that Montague continues to stretch into the harder areas of lesbian life and that her sexy, romantic and undeniably compelling books get longer and richer as a result.	2002-01-07

But it could have benefited from an editor's attention. In addition to the repetitive flaws that someone else wrote about, there's the element an editor should bring which is &quot;who cares&quot; about every secondary character and change of scene. There were one or two scenes that were just more of the same. They didn't add to character or develop the plot, instead they slowed down otherwise good pacing. <br />This book also has a growing pet peeve that I'm finding in a lot of books, which is referring to characters constantly by the color of their hair, their relative height or age. Once in a while it might help the plot to remind the reader who is older or taller, or to jazz up a visual with a detail about appearance. But more than that I find jarring. It's not dramatic, it's just odd. Give the readers some credit for remembering these details and stick to their names. That's why they have names.	2002-01-04

As reviewer MJ Lowe says, you need not know Xena to enjoy every bit of this book.<br />Which begs the question, doesn't it -- when the writing is this good and the setting so luscious, why must one woman be tall, older and dark-haired and the other young, naive and blonde? Maas's writing is good enough that Xena and Gabrielle were only starting points. She takes these traits and makes them over in two new, refreshing characters.<br />Like Lori Lake, LJ Maas doesn't need the Xena crutch. It's fun for the Xena fans but I would love to see the wings really stretch for this writer. With writing and imagination like this I bet Maas would do just fine with two redheads of the same age and height.	2002-01-04

It reminded me strongly of the Rita Mae Brown I once loved -- quirky characters and excellent writing. <br />It looks at lesbian life in a different way than the romance novels do, which provides for a rich story with a lot of breadth. Fortunately, even though I don't consider this book a romance per se, it's got plenty of the good stuff. <br />I am so glad this book was brought back into print.

The price of bigotry is so high and this kind of story would make many people understand that.<br />Having said that, there is much in this book that felt like preaching to the choir. Straight America probably won't read it (which is a pity) and I had to fight the urge to skip ahead when what was happening seemed like an all-too-common or obvious consequence. <br />Nevertheless, this was an inventive tale and I enjoyed it. It just didn't move me to the heights I have come to expect from the top lesbian romance writers. I think that Gun Shy is the better book, but by all means, read them both! Lake has made an incredibly strong start as a writer and if you don't read them now you'll just want to read them later so you can see where it all began.<br />Pet peeve message: Every time a lead character is referred to by a physical characteristic it grates on me like fingernails on a chalkboard. \\"The blonde walked away\\" or \\"The tall woman frowned.\\" That's the kind of reference that ought to be reserved for a nameless walk-on, not the leads! I realize now that this is an uber fiction convention, but that doesn't make it less irritating. It' the only aspect of the book that comes off amateurish.	2001-12-15

The women in it are real and their feelings have true context. Instead of cold and sterile sex acts between people portrayed as obsessed with looks and their own image, this anthology overflows with the fluid nature of human sexuality and genuine human warmth.<br />Some may read for the historical perspective and others may miss the explicit-anything-for-shock-value gender games and power plays that are required it seems in all of the &quot;best of&quot; lesbian erotica out there now. I read it for the emotional impact because when it comes to erotica I need the emotional tie. Given how many lesbians (whether they admit it or not) read lesbian romance novels, I don't think I'm alone.	2001-12-15

Gun Shy is a long, detailed story of two women who finally make their way in the world with enough confidence to choose each other. It was funny and intense and the main characters were complicated and real.<br />After reading Ricochet in Time and Gun Shy (which is the better written novel in my opinion) I can only say that Lake does not need the Xena crutch. She has no trouble creating characters that are little like a raven-haired warrior and her blonde sidekick. The resemblances are unnecessary and I urge the author to give them up completely. <br />Away from the Xena world, and its sometimes purplish prose (raven-haired...gag me), I have no doubt that Lake could come up with equally wonderful characters. Of all the uber writers, Lake comes the closest to the lesbian romance writers I greatly admire. I would love to see what she can really do. Writing sincerely about the complex nature of love, passion and commitment is *NOT* easy, but I think Lake may be up to the job.	2001-12-15

It opens with the nominal point-of-view of Elizabeth, who tells us she is lonely, tells us she is withdrawn, and tells us she pretends interest to the things she used to care deeply about. <br />I wish I could say that the stilted recital was meant to artistically mirror Elizabeth's frozen state after an unexpected break-up, but things simply don't get any better. For the full half of the book I endured the flat narrative, Elizabeth related all the things we needed to know to understand every situtation she confronted, ruining all sense of mystery for the reader. It's not badly written--unlike some writers, Stelboum knows her mechanics. I just couldn't connect with Elizabeth.	2001-11-26

I know when I found it, years ago, I was comforted by the portrayal of two women making their way in a world that does not want them to be together. They lack even the words to describe their feelings for each other. When one describes her physical reaction to the other's lovemaking as &quot;melting&quot; I thought that was a perfect description for the book.

It's exciting when a writer picks up minor characters from a previous work and gives them a novel of their own. These two women were worthy of the effort. This novel delivers everything I've learned Martin delivers: strong characterizations, insightful internal monologues and plots based on the grey areas of life. Martin excels at issues that ought to be black-and-white and shows how complicated they can turn out to be.<br />What really struck me about this book, though, was how Martin seems to be stretching her wings a bit. The book is longer, and more time is given to the entire backdrop of these women's lives, not just where their lives intersect. The characterizations are strong as usual, but they're also rich with small details. <br />I've really noticed that Bella Books is delivering longer, more complicated works from established writers. I already thought Martin was a fine writer. If Mirrors is anything to go by, she will soon be a truly great one now that she is with a publisher that seems to let writers fly to new heights.	2001-11-10

The romance is heartfelt, the women very likable and really a very good light read.<br />Given that McCann seems to have a real sense of good plotting and the right touch for true romance writing, I am really hoping that her next novel shows some improvements, especially in characterization technique.<br />Characterization doesn't lack -- that's not the problem. I wonder if McCann has screenwriting experience, or perhaps it's just inexperience. When a new character arrives on the page, McCann gives us the entire history of the character, the whole deal, as musings by the character whose point-of-view we're experiencing. After the presentation of the character dialogue ensues and there is no further characterization given. That leads to secondary characters we understand, because we're given their bio when they show up, but who don't grow or change or surprise or delight us as their character emerges over the course of a scene. <br />If Jeanne McCann can smooth out her characterization technique then I think she'll be a real treat to read in the future. Maybe I sound negative, but the book was good enough that I didn't just stop with &quot;4 stars, enjoyable read.&quot; I liked it so much I wanted her next book to be better.	2001-11-10

But I still read the novelization of the movie. And I saw Cynara, Conn's next directing effort. I liked it a bit more than Claire.<br />Passion's Shadow was something different altogether. I liked it much more, and it seemed like new ground for Conn. Maybe that's why I bought She Walks in Beauty. I was hoping for more new ground. I was disappointed.<br />Like Claire--and Conn herself--it's about a writer from L.A. who retreats to the Oregon coast. Like Cynara, one of the characters is ... Cynara. I even knew that when I bought it and I still bought it. I still read it. Unlike Passion's Shadow, which was a real potboiler with some interesting characters, She Walks in Beauty read like a fusion of Claire and Cynara with a familiar frame of lonely lesbian getting lost in the past. <br />Parts of this book are enjoyable passionate, and there's a literary quality to it overall. I just found the characters (another writer writing about writing) too familiar from Conn.<br />I know a lot of women really like Conn's stuff, but unless Conn finds more--and FRESH--material (like she found in Passion's Shadow) I'll never be one of them. The most interesting part of the book for me was the cover.	2001-11-05

In the first couple of the Helen Black mysteries, she seemed like a cookie-cutter ex-cop private detective with a chip on her shoulder. Been there, read that.<br />The years went by and I didn't miss Helen Black, though I know a lot more books were published in the series. Recently, however, I saw a rave, positive print review for Moving Targets. That particular reviewer sometimes hates books I like, but so far has never liked a book that I didn't also like. Could this be the same Helen Black by the same Pat Welch?<br />It is, but it hardly seems possible. Where atmosphere sadly lacked in the earliest books, Moving Targets is drenched with it. Literally. I broke into a sweat just reading about summer in Mississippi. The swelter was inescapable and wonderfully conveyed on the page.<br />Helen, too, has come alive as a character I've never read in the small press mysteries before. She has indeed hit bottom, and makes mistake after mistake. Her judgement is sadly impaired by alcohol, the heat, clothes that refuse to fit, and an urgent desire to end her non-voluntary celibacy. <br />The core mystery was also compelling. Like with VI Warshawsky, it starts small, but rapidly unravels into something big. Soon large men with little brains are chasing Helen through the heat, and Helen is wondering how she got into a mess that started with a family photograph. She fails to resist a predatory seductress and doesn't care that it's her last friend on earth's lover she's rolling around with. But, in her last shining moment before a horrific conclusion, she finds the decency to resist the advances of a woman far too young and unstable to know what she's really doing. <br />Helen Black hits bottom and Pat Welch hits top form in taking her there. After not caring if I ever read another word about Helen Black again I am panting for the next one. Ms. Welch, get busy!	2001-11-05

MJ Lowe's review says a lot of what I would say also say -- Karin Kallmaker's latest novel is simply wonderful. It defies the romance formula on many levels and yet delivers a wrenching, emotional story. There's no shortage of plot, or sketchiness in characterization and a number of authors could take a lesson from this book.<br />For example, Holly never tells us, &quot;Clay works on his search for Nirvana while I do all the work.&quot; Instead, Kallmaker shows us Clay home early from work, he's meditating when Holly gets home hours later. She puts away groceries, does dishes, waters plants, blames herself for not getting to the mending, then he saunters out of his study and starts bugging her for food. That's characterization. That's showing, not telling. And that's just a *fraction* of the excellent storytelling in this book.<br />271 pages, in a type 1 or 2 points smaller than Naiad's usual -- it's a tome. The pacing is wonderful for the length. The construction of the plotline is another rule breaker -- the two main characters don't actually meet until nearly three-quarters of the way through the book. To keep our interest we're given a couple of very brief flash &quot;fowards&quot; to show exactly what will happen when they do finally see each other in a bar. At that point my heart was pounding nonstop. Do yourself a favor and don't read the last quarter of the book when you're sleepy... or alone! Kallmaker fans know what I'm talking about.<br />There are a number of downers in this book -- another romance formula rule breaker. Homophobia, &quot;ex-gay&quot; ministries, even a memo detailing why homosexuals should not be allowed to get married. And every one of them is countered in a realistic, uplifting way that both puts homophobes in the spotlight instead of shadows and models (without a hint of preachiness) a way for those of us who live the real world to not just cope, but to be happy in the face of ignorance and hate. I think that Kallmaker would say that being happy inspite of them is the best revenge.<br />I'm going to wait a week and read this book again. As much as a found to love the first time I know I'm going to find more the second. I'll read Chapter 11 twice. Kallmaker fans know what I'm talking about.	2001-11-05

First Laura Adams (Karin Kallmaker's fantasy/sci-fi pseudonym) floors me with &quot;Sleight of Hand&quot; and now Nene Adams has done the same with &quot;The Sunne in Gold.&quot; Both books have a strong historical plot line and -- somewhat refreshingly -- neither have anything to do with Xena! (And neither claim to!)<br />The &quot;Sunne in Gold&quot; is well-researched and highly enjoyable. I have been longing for someone to give me a fully realized female knight and here it is. I'll reread this again and again, I'm sure, and I am hoping for many, many more like it.	2001-08-29

For that message alone, this book is worth the read.<BR>She is brutally honest first about herself. As I read I imagined that some day she would give this book to her children without apologies and say to them, as she says to all of us, &quot;This is who I am.&quot; From that she can hope that they won't make the same mistakes she did, and those things she did well will light their way in a difficult world.<BR>She is also brutally honest about people who hurt her and gratefully forthright about those who helped her. This is a book about shaking off the past, picking out the diamonds from the paste and just going forward. It's uplifting as an example of one way to survive living in the public eye, but it's just as relevant to those of us who live much more mundane lives.<BR>I am not a big fan of autobiographies since they often seem solely aimed at selling a product (a persona) to further record or tickets sales. No so, this book. Melissa Etheridge scrubs off the persona and gives up all the secrets.	2001-08-29
US	45822932	R3BEVDSNS3MIUJ	0967120322	968989965	A Wild Sea	Books	4	9	10	N	N	Wild Sea, Indeed	Redemption, grief, recovery and the challenge of a new lover -- these are familiar themes. But their familiarity needn't be a barrier to a good read, and but for one flaw, &quot;A Wild Sea&quot; is a good read, indeed. The flaw? It's too short for themes of such depth.<BR>Montague does a very believable, moving job with characters and plot, but it just seemed to wrap up too neatly and quickly toward the end. &quot;Watermark&quot; -- which for me sets the standard for romances dealing with grief -- is probably a third longer than &quot;A Wild Sea&quot; and delivered that much more high impact characterization and depth of plot. But for its relative shortness, this was an excellent romance. I will be pursuing all of Rebecca Montague's other books and crossing my fingers that they will get as long as they need to be and the writer's talent will be allowed to flower to its very fullest. Women of Cape Winds Press please note: readers have a longer attention span than you seem to think.	2001-08-29
US	45822932	R68GQ9DKGMHVY	1931513015	91230257	Winged Isis	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Pure Feminist Sci-Fi	A long time ago I gave up on feminist science fiction because the political correctness far outweighed its visionary aspects. The last such novel I enjoyed was book 3 of the Isis series. I didn't know I'd have to wait 5 years for book 4.<br />I found this installment walking the fine line of feminist philosophy and good action/plotting. The women aren't either warriors or politicians, but a mix of both, and they aren't perfect. Their crisis is so intense that no one can just sit back and offer their input while others do the work -- it's put up or shut up time.<br />Wonderfully, it's very clear from the ending that book 5 will be written soon. Kali needs Whit back. The love stories that interweaves the action is intense and the erotic content an extension of character development. <br />Fans of the Isis series will like this one. Anyone hungry for a story about a community of women struggling, loving and surviving will like this one.	2001-08-15

[...] seemed to be included just for shock value, and the mysteries themselves were forced. The love relationship between Brett and Allie didn't ring true. They seemed all physical and no emotion.<br />This installment seems like its almost written by a different person. Perhaps moving to a new press made the difference, but When Evil Changes Face was both a fast-paced, well-scripted mystery and a complete character study of Brett and Allie. For the first time I felt as if I knew them. Even the [...] seemed like an extension of their characters rather than just tacked on for reader titillation. <br />Suspend your disbelief that Brett and Allie can pass for high school students. Just believe, and then enjoy the story. I also got a little tired of how \\"beautiful\\" and \\"good-looking\\" a woman had to be to interest Brett. A woman can be attractive without being beautiful and Brett's too smart not to know that.<br />After the very disappointing When Some Body Disappears, I was going to give up on Brett Higgins, but When Evil Changes Face complete restored my interest. I look forward to the next installment with great anticipation.	2001-08-15

The women are fully realized, complicated people and the setting is just wonderful. I don't think I've read anything based in Alaska before. The exploration of tribal customs and the relationship between the government and the indigenous people is compelling without being preachy. The love affair feels real, like I could know these women, or at least I'd like to. This is no &quot;gosh, she's gorgeous&quot; on page 2 that leads to happily ever after a mere 120 pages later. <br />After reading it a second time, I did find myself thinking that the dialogue, especially Lela's, was flatter than I remembered. I literally thought that Lela spoke in a near monotone for quite a while. The author could spend a little more time describing HOW words are spoken. In some of the love scenes, some excellent heat could have been stoked further by the addition of phrases like &quot;she said, her voice husky...&quot; or &quot;With a distinct edge of command, she said ....&quot; There were several instances where I stopped to re-read a line of dialogue because I didn't know if Lela spoke seductively or playfully or sarcastically. The context just wasn't enough. Kay only suffered in this area during the love scenes. At their most intimate moments I wanted to hear their voices and there just wasn't enough to go on.<br />I *was* enthralled by the depth of virtually every aspect of this book on a second reading.	2001-07-25

Instead of more, however, we get even less. Barely 130 pages, Office Hours is over before it's begun.<br />Boone delivers real tension between her characters, but they're paperthin otherwise. Most of us don't go to work just to move our relationships along -- we have issues to deal with that distract from our relationships. That's a real missed opportunity here. In addition to the arrival of the spiteful ex, there are plenty of other reasons a workplace relationship is hard to make a success, but Boone barely acknowledges them. Since one woman is the other's supervisor, there are real concerns they must face. Not only are they going to get grief because they're lesbians, every major corporation has rules about supervisors and employees, and for good reason. These two smart women ought to know that and be concerned about their futures more than they are. That's just one example of where we are told they are smart and not shown it.<br />I think there's real talent in Boone's ideas and structure, but the author needs to give me more character development, more background and longer books as a result. Passion is good, but &quot;stunning&quot; looks aren't enough to convince me that Cynthia and Kaitlan had enduring feelings for each other.	2001-06-20

Her boyfriend and she have separate homes and they have been drifting apart. She takes a weekend trip to gather her thoughts and ends up snowbound in the cabin of Leah Beck, a renowned painter, who is recovering from the death of her long-timer partner and from the effects of a creative block that has left her unable to paint.<br />By the end of the weekend Jackie is in Leah's arms and Leah whispers to her, &quot;This is what it's like between women.&quot; Stunned by her response to Leah, Jackie doesn't resist when relatives arrive to &quot;rescue&quot; her from the snow and the two women are parted before they were ever really together. (At this point I could not put the book down!)<br />This weekend begins a painful and yet joyous journey of coming out for Jackie that any lesbian will identify with. There's the language to learn, for one thing! For Leah, the encounter finds her creative block finally broken. When the two women meet again they are different people but yet again the passion creates an aching smoulder between them that will please any fan of the lesbian romance genre. For Kallmaker fans, it doesn't get much better than the blouse-tearing, sheet-ravelling, paint-peeling encounter that finally occurs.<br />Wonderfully resolved, well-written, and tightly-plotted, Painted Moon is a classic. Like her portrayal of the symphony conductor in Paperback Romance, Kallmaker is top notch at getting into the head of an artist. This book inspired the short story &quot;Smudges&quot; in her recently released anthology &quot;Frosting on the Cake&quot; where the passion still smoulders just beneath the surface for these two women and, happily for those of us who believe in romance, it seems it always will.	2001-06-07
US	45822932	R195WEZ7R74F20	1562802143	17482912	Christabel: A Novel	Books	5	20	20	N	N	A Pure Lesbian Gothic Romance	Christabel, from the prolific Karin Kallmaker's Laura Adams persona, is a gothic romance, a tale of the supernatural and how an evil entity torments one woman's soul through generations. There are two stories told: first, how the evil found and took a young woman, Christabel, for his own in colonial New York. The second story is of the modern la Christabel, supermodel, spinning out yet another life to provide the suffering that the evil thrives on. <br />In Coleridge's version of this tale, even nature itself is evil (so green, so female), as is the witch Geraldine, who bewitches young Christabel with veiled references to lesbianism. Christabel is just a victim and the rescuer is Sir Leoline, who must fight both the witch and nature for Christabel's soul.<br />Laura Adams turns this story upside down. Geraldine represents the peaceful, natural world of the native Manhattans, and when the young Christabel meets the native woman, passion soon follows. Their joyous happiness is discovered and fouled by a demon Puritan preacher, who contrives Geraldine's downfall. Easy to do when Halley's Comet has appeared overhead -- blame it on the nearest nonconformist female and call her a witch. As the preacher takes possession of Christabel in the past, the modern day Christa has adopted desperate measures to try to break the cycle. An investment banker, Dina has renounced the part of her heritage that has passed down over time, but one touch of Christa's hand brings the power -- and the passion -- surging back. Defeated in the past, she arms herself for another battle in this lifetime. <br />The story weaves back and forth in time with perfect clarity. Minor characters from the past have their roles to play in the present. Even an ancient tree contributes -- significantly -- to the link between the two stories.<br />The plot makes for a good read, and the writing is pure Kallmaker/Adams -- prose matching time period and, of course, unbelievably erotic tension between her characters. The reality of life on the island of Manhattan in the late 1600s is well researched. The resolution is electric and quite, quite satisfactory. Once you start, you won't put it down until the last page.	2001-06-01

Fortunately, I do. There's something about the overall story that is a little over-the-top -- the villians are a bit one-dimensional, the motivations of young farmer Agnes are limited largely to &quot;got to save the farm!&quot; and Hope a little too uptight educated lady (like the professor in Desert of the Heart). Nothing unexpected happens, which is not to say that it isn't exciting when things do happen, it's just that some of the flatter characters do and think exactly what you expect them to do. <br />But for more emphasis on character development, this would be an excellent book. For example, we are shown that Hope is educated and well-read by the books she is seen reading, but we're not further enriched by Hope actually thinking in a way that reflects her education. Agnes is much better drawn, intuitively wise but lacking in book-learning. Her &quot;voice&quot; is the only unique one in the novel.<br />This book is satisfying, though, and certainly a pleasant way to pass an afternoon.	2001-06-01

US	45822932	R2MI4BAISCA6U7	0374228590	374549093	Pages for You	Books	3	27	33	N	N	Lukewarm	... I expected more. Almost no one is calling this book a \\"romance,\\" perhaps to keep it from being discounted as a mere genre effort, but it is basically a romance, and not a particularly inspired one at that. <br />As a novel of young infatuation and love, of sexual and intellectual awakening, it succeeds. Brownrigg's characterization of Flannery plays with sincerity--but there was nothing particularly profound. I felt I had read this story before and I took away nothing new.<br />As a coming out novel with an exploration of sexual identity it plays quite poorly compared to those much maligned \\"romance\\" novels. Frankly, the lesbian romance writers are delivering these complicated themes with power and passion that Brownrigg doesn't come close to. Even the quoted section on this page reminded me of a similar scene by a lesbian romance writer where a young woman watches a much older woman she yearns after ironing clothes. Every time I see an iron I remember the writer's evocation of the older woman's hands smoothing and caressing the fabric. Brownrigg's description of the way Anne's lips are touching the coffee gives me nothing nearly that evocative and I doubt I'll remember it months from now, let alone years. <br />This novel isn't strong enough to stand up to its hype and therefore disappointed me. It's an enjoyable read, but not a highly diverting one, sometimes thought-provoking, but when I was done I promptly forgot most of it. When a novel really works for me I'll think about it for days, recall scenes vividly, and wish it had never ended. Pages for You didn't do that for me. It left me lukewarm at best.	2001-05-17

All the humor and sincerity that will become the most enjoyable features of all of her romance books abound in this early effort. The plot is solid, the characters the kind of women who could live next door. It's set in 1978, in the year when the gay rights movement was galvanized by the murder of San Francisco's Harvey Milk. Both women are coming out during this difficult time and I liked the historical context of what coming out then was like ... it was a different world and the times were riskier. So much has changed, and so much hasn't.<br />This early effort lacks the richness of language that flowers later in Kallmaker's work. But the story spins out quickly and gathers the reader closely. Her fans won't want to miss it. Compare it to her Unforgettable and see how good she already was, and then how much her talent has grown.	2001-05-17

Like with most things in my life, I didn't listen to myself. I devoured this book whole. I defy anyone to do otherwise.<br />When you read this book, and you will, you'll have two incredible forces working on you: curiosity and greed. Curiosity will make you turn the pages ever faster, asking yourself whatever happened with Cat &amp; Jessica, with Leslie &amp; Sarah, with Shea &amp; Anthea, with Natalie &amp; Cinny? Then there's the greed: pick any story and you're hooked. It'll be so good that you'll just want one more. Then another. And another. Before you know it'll be 3 a.m. and you'll be considering calling in sick so you can read the whole thing again. <br />As others have mentioned, &quot;Smudges&quot; is simply outstanding in a book that has nothing but well-written, engaging, sexy, moving stories. Drawn from Leah &amp; Jackie of Painted Moon, the story is Leah's internal monologue as she paints Jackie from head to toe for a photographer's art project, Painted Woman. Think about it: every square inch of flesh touched by the painter's brush. Jackie can't move or she'll smudge the paint. &quot;Smudges&quot; is all of 7 pages long--a true short story--and unrelenting in its eroticism.<br />Two stories are novella length and the rest somwhere in between. I was amazed at the sheer variety of plots--only one story focuses on a serious argument and how the couple makes up. There's menopause, insemination, equality between the sheets, marriage, money, fame and wondering why the bread dough won't rise. &quot;Wild Things Are Free&quot; is incendiary, with Faith &amp; Sydney desperate for each other for all the wrong reasons. <br />Like with all of her books, Kallmaker delivers some simple relationship truths along the way. From this one I'm taking her focus on the single most cruel thing one lover can say to another: &quot;I don't love you anymore.&quot; When one woman braced herself to hear these words, convinced they were the next she would hear, I was so caught by her pain that I was in tears. <br />My curiosity has been met -- for now -- but I am greedy for more. Lots more. Please?	2001-05-10

Half of the book is written in first person, giving us the narrative of Faith Fitzgerald's unwilling attraction to her boyfriend's sister. Faith's story is alternated with Sydney Van Allen's. Sydney is running for political office and has a promiscuous past to live down. She's not looking for a relationship, and certainly not with her brother's almost fiancee. These two women are mature and focused, and very strong. But when confronted by feelings they can't ignore they must find yet more courage to turn away from the safe and expected paths of their lives toward each other. <br />Faith thinks of Sydney as the Wild Thing, the temptation she can't resist, but Faith is definitely Sydney's Wild Thing as well. The love scenes are intense and tender, the story truly touching. It's a must read for anyone who is tired of the Bible being used to condemn their lives because it is uplifting, too.	2001-04-09

Written nearly 20 years ago, this story presented a radical idea: that two women who have many other options to choose from can choose each other. Most of us now take this idea for granted, but 20 years ago not even lesbians were certain they had a right to happiness and forever after, or that they deserved to dream of romance and love.<br />From a literary standpoint, this novel, for me, thankfully also marked the end of flowery euphemisms for female genitalia -- Forrest's remarkable skill to describe by nuance undoubtedly inspired many other writers (like Karin Kallmaker and Marianne Martin, to name two) to make it clear exactly what is going on ... without explicit sexual language. That writing, not quite erotica, but quite erotic, definitely not pornographic, is one of the hallmarks of a good lesbian romance for me. It's a remarkable achievement in prose and Forrest set the standard for all who followed.<br />Because this book dates back 20 years, some of the relationship contexts have become dated -- for example, the &quot;consciousness-raising&quot; and emphasis on processing early on. But balance that against a moment of clarity when the two women realize they want each other and realize, also, that they really are old enough, free enough, and courageous enough to go to a motel in the middle of the day. The moments when both of them, separately, realize they have to reach out for what they want, were profound for me, in the context of the character's lives and in the context of our community's struggle to live open lives. We first have to know what we want, and have the strength to reach for it.	2001-03-24

Sometimes, however, the emphasis on fabulous sex disappoints me -- at least intellectually -- because it takes so much more for a relationship to survive. Some writers expect me to believe that there's a happy-ever-after between two women who don't even like each other much, or haven't stayed out of bed long enough to know the basics about each other. <br />That's never a problem with a Kallmaker novel and in Embrace in Motion she brings the message home with understated poignance. Sarah and Leslie find friendship based on their respect for each other and their differences, and sex isn't the be-all and end-all of the life they are beginning together. <br />I was touched to tears by the final pages. More vividly than with any erotic scene of hers I've read so far, Kallmaker had me longing to be one of her characters, just holding hands with the woman I loved, looking forward together into a future that promises every dream fulfilled.	2001-03-15

Dorian's story takes completely unexpected turns and it was diverting from beginning to end. Herring is not the most subtle author in the lesbian romance genre, at least of those I've read, but if you like it when two women get right down to business then you're going to like this book as much as I did. Oven mitts mandatory.	2001-03-08

The sex is hot and fun, which I think is the author's trademark. Marcel is a complicated character and rides the storm with a compelling tenacity, and if a few loose ends weren't tied up it was only a minor distraction. This books read fast, delivers real entertainment and many thigh-clenching moments. What's more to want?	2001-03-08
US	45822932	R3VCYS3MF9POKM	096777537X	568054074	Sleight of Hand	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Simply Stunning	I didn't expect this. I think that Karin Kallmaker is a fine romance writer, and I really enjoyed her Laura Adams books as well. They're all well-written and great entertainment.<br />I did not expect this book--it totally blew me away. First, the plot. I read a lot of Mercede Lackey and other sword and sorcery type books, but the storyline in this book is nothing like that and yet it is truly a fantasy book. I can't even begin to describe its mysterious and mystical overtones intertwined in a very human story of a modern day woman who doesn't know who she is, only who she isn't. Second, the length. This is a LONG book, quite a surprise from a small press as another reviewer said. And since first books of trilogies tend to be the shortest, my appetite is truly whetted.<br />Last, the writing. In her romances Kallmaker always has a great turn of phrase and moving prose, especially around emotions. But I didn't know she could do write like this -- vivid and tragic moments, true pathos, and the kind of love that changes history. I was taken with the moments when she told us what did not happen instead of what did.<br />I don't want to raise anyone's expectations so high that the book can't possibly please, but this novel is a stunner. Wow.	2001-03-04

The plot reads like a gothic bodice-ripper but written for people who like to read about women together. It's nowhere near the amount of character development as, say, Artemis Oakgrove manages. The author also wrote a guide that supplies &quot;1,000 sassy synonyms&quot; for &quot;said&quot; and employs all of them in this book -- reminding me very much of much of how writing in kids' books is over the top to keep their interest. But the subject is grown-up, featuring submissive/dominant relationships between women. The subject matter didn't bother me, but since the characters are so poorly developed, the dominant woman didn't seem, well, like a woman, but rather a woman dropped into a part written for a man. I felt like I had read this book before with the primary protagnist as a man. Therefore I hesitate to call this book &quot;lesbian.&quot; It would need far more character development to convince me these women were into each other and not just power.	2001-03-04

Not since Paperback Romance has Karin Kallmaker written a book so lighthearted and delectable. It's as delicious as all the recipes included, and as funny as a screwball comedy. Val's little white lies have caught up to her and she needs to prove that not only can she completely renovate and redecorate an old inn, she also needs to prove she can cook. Jamie has an old inn needing repair. She's clueless with a hammer, but she can cook like Julia Child. Val is flightly. Jamie is serious. Val likes to knock down walls. Jamie likes to punch down dough. Can two crazy, mismatched gals find love in a small town? <br />This is a Kallmaker romance. Of course the answer is yes! Along the way is the use of chocolate body paint that put me in a swoon. I read that part twice. Okay, three times.	2001-02-25

If you are lucky enough to find a copy of this book, don't let the awful cover turn you off. Inside you'll find a series of short stores that form a complete novel, and in those stories some excellent prose. Vivid with exasperation is the woman who is underwhelmed by her co-worker's stated tolerence for her lesbianism right after she has just been asked to applaud madly for her co-worker's engagement. Torn with anger is the daughter who refuses to comfort her religious father with the words that &quot;Jesus forgave Judas&quot; because she can't bring herself to compare her life and her partner to a traitor. Confused is the ex-husband who doesn't understand why his wife has taken up with another woman. Deeply in love are women at the center of the novel. Each story is a piece of a mosaic and the whole captures the range of lesbian lives with insight and feeling.	2001-02-17

It is hilarious, just flat out funny -- especially so for any woman who survived the uptight politcally correct stages that feminism and lesbian feminism went through. Those happy days when feminists didn't want to associate with lesbians, when lesbians picketed drag queens and every body spent way too much energy criticizing everyone else's lack of activism. Not only does Valley of the Amazons shine a spotlight on the (in hindsight) ludicrous PC wars, it makes room for a tentative romantic entanglement that takes a shy lesbian through all the stages of coming out. The sequel, Who Was That Masked Woman? is worth a read, but not nearly as good as this one.	2001-02-17
US	45822932	R3TZWNM7Y0OFGU	1562802631	42300681	Treasured Past	Books	5	17	20	N	N	Another Naiad -- that's a good thing!	I don't expect a vampire chronicle to make me laugh, or a mystery to turn me on. Genre fiction is what it is, and if a book delivers exactly what it promises -- be it a passionate romance or a blood-sucking thriller -- then that's what I judge it by. Even Naiad's detractors can't seem to stop themselves from reading more, and I believe that's because we get what we expect, often what we need, and more rarely, something beyond our hopes.<br />Treasured Past is another of Linda Hill's quiet romances. At least I think of them as quiet, because they come off the page so gently that the characters have possessed my imagination before I realized I have been completely drawn in. Once I've been drawn in the flesh and heart of her characters begin to beat with real life. Before I now it I'm wishing I lived next door to these women. It happens that way in every Linda Hill I've read. I'm seduced before I even realize I'm being courted. That's probably what makes us wish real life was more like a romance novel, and why we keep reading.<br />I also highly recommend her Class Reunion, which is on the part of my shelves I reserve for books I intend to reread.	2001-02-13

The 50s and 60s strapped women into undergear that created cleavage only since surpassed by Xena. This collection features covers from lesbian pulp fiction of that era and the cleavage is eye-popping! It's delightful to thumb through, a real blast from the past to read. <br />Aside from the cover art is the copy from the covers. Phrases like &quot;The Savage Novel of a Lesbian on the Loose&quot; and &quot;Blunt revelations of what happens when deviate women seek advancement in the business world&quot; and &quot;His new girl-wife was a vibrant, virgin beauty...and a sensual, shrewd, licentious lesbian!&quot;<br />Then there's the pure trash ... titles like &quot;Satan was a lesbian&quot; and &quot;Man Hater&quot; with covers so campy they made me laugh. All in all, this a really fun book and quite a conversation piece!	2001-02-09

I'm not talking about the whodunnit part of the book either. As intensely portrayed is the turning point that RObin and KT have reached -- it's settle down or break apart time. It's make a family nest or go their separate ways. I did not know until the very last page what Robin would decide. Robin's doubts and suffering are heartbreaking, as is KT's confusion and helplessness. It made the mystery emotionally rich, which is a rare treat in most mystery novels. <br />The whodunnit part of the books is as enjoyable as always with Maiman, who just gets better with fast-paced action plots. I recommend this one 100%.	2001-02-09

When a group of lesbians realize that they are all sharing the same nightmares, their search for answers leads them into the heart of the Mojave Desert and to a woman named Sirena, who is being held captive. The problems they encounter, the talents they all bring to the table forms an inspired story as told by Maddy. Maddy's low expectations from life and love have made her sarcastic and self-deprecating, and her wit is delightful. She doesn't believe that you can find love in nightmares, but as she is convinced, so are we.<br />The science fiction/fantasy plot seems to be the hallmark of Karin Kallmaker's Laura Adams pseudonym, but the underlying romance and physicality is pure Kallmaker. Only Karin Kallmaker could write an .... with only two people in the room. Crucial to the plot, these scenes nevertheless melt the pages they're printed on. <br />I'll pick up a romance novel before science fiction or fantasy, but in the case of &quot;Laura Adams&quot; I won't hesitate in the future. Kallmaker/Adams delivers on both levels.	2001-02-09

Gerri Hill generates a lot of steam and delivers a lot of what we all seem like in our romances. Definitely pages to re-read.<br />The plot, however, is weak. Girl is seduced by a reputed Lothario and vows no repeats, but turns to her seducer for succor in a moment of crisis. Misunderstandings and gossip abound. It's not cutting edge and I hope that Hill's next book (which I will eagerly look for) has more stretch in the plotting.	2001-01-25

You will be taught to ignore your child's professions of happiness and to remain smugly sure -- regardless of your child's age -- that you know what is in their hearts and what can't possibly make them happy. You will be told to grieve, not celebrate, when your child is honest with you. Censure, kidnapping, ostracism, brainwashing -- these are the &quot;appropriate&quot; responses that this book will teach you all because your child trusts you enough to say, &quot;I'm gay.&quot;<br />The appropriate response to this book -- full of discredited &quot;research&quot; -- is not to buy it. Instead, sit down and talk with your child about what they want from life, what makes them happy and how you can HELP them get there. Let your love show. Leave the judgement to God.	2001-01-25

It was like a nighttime &quot;adult drama&quot; -- overwrought and improbable, but still fun. <br />I appear to be the only lesbian to review the book so far, and I would advise those lesbians who are looking for a book where lesbianism is something that deeply involves and drives the characters may be a little disappointed. This book appeals to a more mainstream reader. I'm not saying that that is a bad thing; it is within the author's purview to decide what audience she wants to attract. At times I personally felt the fact that the love triangle was between three lesbians was just a little too understated. Having said that, Carrera does end with a ringing endorsement of both the universal nature of love and the power of love to bring peace.	2001-01-25

She draws a character with care and lets the reader come along as the characters grows and copes. Class Reunion is about facing the past before you've really had a chance to cope with it. At times the story had me laughing out loud and many times I thought, &quot;That is so true.&quot; Sometimes, a book like this is just what I need.	2001-01-22

How can she not imagine herself at times to be male, queer, and alienated? <br />I know many woman who won't read this book in spite of its historic importance, and it's always becaues they can't sympathize with the world view that Hall herself endured. When we can actually marry one another in some countries it is hard to understand why Hall only appeals for pity, for understanding and approval from the mainstream, mostly male society. But where else could she look? There was no &quot;community&quot; she could count on, no open lesbians in government to trust.<br />I think if this book is read with the historical context firmly in mind, it is possible then to see the brilliance of the writing and the passion of the story.	2001-01-22

The storyline was refreshing, touching and skillfully delivered -- a far cry from the mediocre and dreary romances so often published in the 80s and early 90s. <br />Marianne Martin is a wonderful writer. I stopped at times to savor a turn of phrase, or to visualize a setting that was richly described. That makes a book a great experience for me. I haven't read Martin's other books ... but plan to rectify that immediately.	2001-01-22

This novel is as giddy as a Harlequin romance, and happy romp to read, if that is all you are looking for. But underneath the satire of formula romance is some wonderful writing that brings music to life. It consumes and feeds Nick, making her otherwordly. I think Nick is one of the best characters Kallmaker has ever done. This is a book full of great characters, from queer, elderly Oscar who reminded me vividly of Hobson from the movie Arthur, to quirky black Samantha, who interior designs her way into wickedly droll Alison's bed. And Carolyn -- mixed up, certain she's frigid Carolyn. What fun! I wanted the story to play on, and on.	2001-01-22

I think the writer should be congratulated for an excellent depiction of the casual racism that Asians receive. Shay, who was born in the US, is told her English is excellent, for example. I have always thought that when reviewing a book, it's best to review the book you read, not the book you wished the author had written, and to rank that book for itself. I loved this book for what it delivered: a solid, intriguing romance between a closeted white accountant and a Japanese-American environmental biologist.<br />Even rarer, this book deals with class differences. Shay is near penniless, though well-educated, and digs sampling wells on an oil refinery. Anthea is rolling in dough she inherited from distant parents. Each woman has real issues about money and it's dealt with in a complex way -- no easy fixes here.<br />Last, I'd add that anyone wanting to see the totality of Kallmaker's ethnic diversity needs to read *all* of her books, including those written as Laura Adams. Night Vision and The Dawning have both black and native American characters who contribute vitally to the action. The Dawning's immersion in the Navajo culture was illuminating.	2001-01-22

This book was not only insightful about life after the &quot;coming out,&quot; it was just plain *funny.* I chuckled and laughed all the way through. Even better, our earnest heroine is *young* and there are all too few novels about younger lesbians that don't wallow in self-imposed marginalization. Jess reminded me of myself in my early 20s. I didn't have a clue either, and just made it up as I went along, a hopeful romantic.	2001-01-22

Lovers goes on long overseas assignment, leaving lonely attractive lesbian at the mercy of two predatory females, one nice and one not. It *is* pure mind candy.<br />But Bold Coast Love twists back on itself as lonely Dr. Claymont is accused of sexual harrassment by the woman she spurns. In a small Maine town an accusation like that has pure power to destroy, but Claymont stays to fight it out and to decide if absense or nearness makes the heart grow fonder. <br />Braund has a real descriptive gift that is poetic at times. I enjoyed every page. Like a good candy bar, it was over too soon.	2001-01-15
US	45822932	R20WZQKKIK9R23	1562802607	444198199	Unforgettable	Books	5	9	16	N	N	Mesmerizing	Like the jazz that Rett Jamison sings, Unforgettable is mesmerizing. It plays for the mind and heart with a simple melody over a complicated background. When and why does a woman give up dreams for excuses? Self-esteem for flattery and lies? How does she turn the corner toward something better? Who can help and who can she trust?<br />It was Rett's journey back to her dreams that fascinated me most, and yet her story is realistic as not everything is fixed. Some things aren't fixed in a week or a even a year. Those things that do work out are movingly realized. This novel is a wonderful read and like a steamy ballad, plays on in the heart and mind long after the music stops.	2001-01-15

Saxon Bennett creates Heroy Arizona for us and plops a manipulative ex-girlfriend that anyone can hate in the midst of a happily nesting couple starting a new life with their daughter. At times Sweet Fire is soap operaish, but I hardly think that's at all a bad thing in a book that is so funny, so sexy and so on target about what happens when a community of lesbians takes over a town. I enjoyed it beginning to end.	2001-01-15

Well I was pleased even though the ending was ambiguous for Teresa and Rayann. Mostly because the writing was so beautiful and this book is as close to life as a 'romance' can get. I really did not want things to turn out the way they did for Louisa but life is like that. It was unexpected from Kallmaker, who I think defaults to making readers laugh and sigh. She made me cry instead. Which is good for me once in a while.	2001-01-10
