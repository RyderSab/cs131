The book continues to follow a polar bear as it attempts to make a seal, a walrus, and a whale a meal.  Animal lovers who don't like to see animals being eaten will not enjoy this book.  But it is an interesting look at polar bears, who are a predatory animal.  The photographs are vivid and large.  Not all of them have bloody meals shown.  I thought that the photos of the polar bear cubs were adorable.  Apparently, they are about the size of a soft drink can when born!  One of the coolest features of the book is the \\"Looking Back\\" section at the end, where readers are invited to look more closely at the photographs throughout the book to examine details and learn more facts about polar bears.  The glossary defines words that seem obvious, even to young readers.  But overall, I think this book could work well with a second or third grade science student--especially boys.	2005-09-23

I was excited about the idea of a book helping me to plan better so that we could eat healthier and I wouldn't end up spending all evening in the kitchen.  The basic concept of this book is that you make one big meal a week and use the leftovers to make other meals throughout the week.  Meaning less prep time on weeknights.  This means that one night you'll have chili. The next night you'll have chili stuffed baked potatoes.  Then on the third day you'll have chili something else.  Some people might not like this kind of repetition, but others will appreciate the convenience.  There are 12 weeks of meals included in this book, with few repeats.  Usually three or four of the meals are similar and two others are simple recipes that are easily made in a few minutes.      I plan to use this book three to four nights a week--on my nights to cook.  There were usually only three recipes a week that my husband and I were interested in.  It's too bad this book doesn't have any pictures.  But all in all, I'm excited to try it out.    Update after two weeks:  Though my husband has enjoyed my using this book because I've made some dinners that we liked but might not have made without this impetus, I think we are going to abandon this system.   Too often the shopping lists advise you to buy a particular size package of an item, but the recipe only uses half of it (or less).  But there have been a few good recipes.  We especially enjoyed the Spanish Rice with Sausage and the Corn Chowder.	2005-09-06

Gaskins points out some statistics and religious issues that show the importance of religion to young people, and concludes by telling readers that while she grew in respect and understanding, she did not grow spiritually while working on this book.  The book then opens with the story of a young girl who defines herself as \\"still searching.\\"  From there, we meet teenagers and twenty-somethings of different denominations of Jewish, Muslim, and Christian faiths as they talk about their feelings toward their religion.  For most, we have a photo, a name, and an age t o associate with the story. The book does a great job of introducing young people to the fact that there are differences within a religion.  However, the book also leaves gaps.  There are many, many more options out there that are not included in this book.  The book does not include any Mormons or Jehovah's Witnesses, but it does include a young woman who identified herself as an atheist.  The book is grouped by chapter on topics that cover morality, tolerance, diversity, women, basically emphasizing the point that everyone decides what is true for them.  This book doesn't provide religious answers.  It provides religious options.  This basically balanced book will work in most libraries.	2005-05-26

Each spread has several photographs with captions containing curious facts.  The easy-to-read text is blocked in chunks making it easy to pick and choose what you want to read.  Each chapter ends with a comparably bland page with a summary and a box with hyperlinks, career directions, and places to visit, easily skippable.  The book contains a note at the beginning saying that they cannot guarantee the stability of the links, but the instability of the Internet is not addressed in the book, which is just one example of the areas left untouched by this book.  There isn't really enough information in this book for anything more than casual browsing.  Kids in grades 4 through 6 will like the references to Harry Potter and other trivia, but this is no DK book, just an imitation. <br />	2005-05-26

It begins with an introduction that discusses the need for revision generally and for revision in our writing education and addressing the challenges of teaching revision, pointing out that kids don't want to revise and haven't been taught the importance of it.  The rest of the book is a practical guide to teaching writing with elementary and middle school age students.  The book is chock full of ideas you can use in your classrooms, quotations from writers on writing, and examples of student work.  Angelillo takes you through a year of writing instruction highlighting mentor authors, qualities of good writing, punctuation and grammar skills.  The appendices include suggestions for administrators and coaches, becoming a teacher leader, and organizing study groups.  This is a well written book that teachers won't want to miss.	2005-05-13

Ten year-old Akilah finds her best friend changed when she comes back from a summer trip to Nigeria to visit her grandmother and go through a \\"coming of age ceremony.\\"  Eventually her friend confesses that her parents took her to an illegal doctor to be circumcised.  Akilah promises not to tell anyone, but these things have a way of getting told.   <br /> <br />Akilah tells the story from the eyes of a child, but this book is not meant for children.  It could serve as a gentle introduction to the idea of Female Genital Mutilation or as a lesson in human rights to middle school students.  There is an after word by the author including more facts about FGM and an invitation for kids to email her their thoughts.  I would be interested in the sorts of emails she has gotten. <br /> <br />Williams-Garcia borders on overly didactic, but the tone of the book and the friendship between Akilah and Victoria save it from becoming overly so.   <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to girls age 12 and up. <br />	2005-05-12

Each celebration has a sentence indicating its theme, and the other page in the spread has an appropriate expression for that occasion.  The book may be used to teach simple etiquette for birthdays, Mother's Day, Thanksgiving, winning a sporting event, and weddings. The pictures feature kids and families of different races, and the last two pages include comments in smaller type for the parent/teacher to introduce the history of the celebration and the traditions of other cultures.	2005-04-27

It covers aspects of African history, slavery, the UNIA, African Americans in the 1960s, as well as the creation, language, symbolism, and tools of the Kwanzaa celebration.  African words in the text are in bold, colored print to draw attention to them.  Towards the end of the book, however, this becomes a distraction because nearly the whole page is filled with these bold, colored words.  Other aspects, such as the use of the term \\"U.S. Africans,\\" \\"Ebonics,\\" and \\"outroduction,\\" make the book seem nave or just silly.  It is hard to tell what grade level the author is aiming for with this book because it is above younger elementary students and seems to talk down to older ones.  Perhaps this book could be used with 4th and 5th graders to talk about diversity, but I think its uses will be limited.   <br /> <br />The author also includes references to his great-great grandparents along with a photo of himself which further serves to give the book less credibility. <br />	2005-04-26

Each holy book gets four pages with large text and brightly colored photographs.  The book includes two pages of \\"Find Out More\\" information written in smaller type, a glossary containing words bolded from the text of the book, Books to Read, and an index.  The glossary could be more extensive, but it probably doesn't need to include each and every strange word since the text and the pictures do a good job of providing a context for unfamiliar words.  The book opens by comparing the child's favorite book to the idea of sacred books.  This approach will work best with younger children, perhaps in grades 2 to 3.	2005-04-26

The fictional story of Nary, a young Cambodian refugee, is mixed with facts about immigration, citizenship, and other cultures.  Young students may not be able to make the jump required to connect the story with the facts with the illustrations, but older students should not have a problem with this.  The overall effect, though, is of disconnectedness.  This won't be a book read for its story, though the story is an important one with themes teachers may want to use in their classrooms like immigration, multiculturalism, racism, tolerance, and refugees.	2005-04-21

It begins with twenty pages of explanation about homelessness as an issue, and the rest of the book is about how young people can volunteer to organize fundraisers to assist the homeless.  It presents several fictional stories about volunteers (another nearly twenty pages-all printed in italics) and follows with suggestions on how to help.  The appendix includes examples of a flyer, petition, and letter.   <br /> <br />The large text size, the simplistic sentence structure, and the words in the glossary make this title most appropriate for upper elementary students:  fourth or fifth grade.  This title may help with reports about homelessness, but it would be most helpful in encouraging activism.   <br /> <br />Be aware that there are several grammatical errors. <br />	2005-04-21

It follows Mindy, a teenage Native American girl of the Hopi and Tewa tribes in Arizona, through the Corn Grinding Ceremony and the Yah-ne-wah Dance.  The majority of the book is told in the first person in simple, readable language easily understood by 4th to 6th graders.  A few pages at the beginning give a brief overview of Hopi history and culture, and a few pages at the end take readers through a description of a Hopi year through the seasons.  The \\"About the Author\\" section starts the book, which makes for a weak beginning.  Nonetheless this book is a browser's delight. Every page has brightly colored photographs illustrating the story.  Not to mention, it is full of information about Hopi culture.  This book will find a home on school and public library shelves.	2005-03-30

Usually I read books for the characters, and this book was not character driven in any kind of intimate way.  The language is sparse, and it failed to draw me in with its heavily didactic tone.  It really isn't so much of a novel as it is a parable designed to outline the author's basic philosophy.  And it's message is a rather simple one: \\"Wisdom cannot be taught.\\"<br />One reviewer wrote that the book is \\"definitely for those new to spiritual self-examination,\\" and I'd have to agree with that statement.  It is an interesting view of Buddhism, but it's very European and can't be taken too authentically as it is an outsider's view looking in on Buddhist/Indian culture.<br />For me, the book was almost painful in the way that Siddhartha could not deal with happiness.  Any time he acheived a modicum of happiness with his life, he became unhappy because he was happy.  I could not deal with his ungrateful attitude.  It quite literally left me with a frustrated feeling.  Since the book was meant to be a parable (or a recitation of a belief), the reader never really gets to know Siddhartha, so he ends up coming across as a self-centered [man].  He liked to listen to himself talk; he used people and was never grateful for their affection for him.  He was a seeker, and he simply could not stop seeking no matter what it meant for anyone.  He didn't care about people; he cared about his search.<br />I will admit, however, that there were bits and pieces of the book that I did appreciate.  I liked Siddhartha's appreciation of the river, and I enjoyed reading the part where he and the ferryman talked about listening to the river.  This is exactly the sort of thing that I was hoping to find in this book.  But it was a brief passage and gave way to the cliched doctrine that filled the rest of the book.<br />The book seemed to be about being true to one's self above all others, that this is the path of wisdom.  This message did not speak to me in any way.is is the path of wisdom.  This message did not speak to me in any way.	2004-01-31

It isn't my usual reading choice, but I do love travel writing and food writing for the appreciative tone, the gushing, the descriptions you can feel on your skin. And this was both in one. It was a lovely read just for that. <br />What stood out to me most was the way Frances and Ed focused on the house renovation. I loved the way they jumped into their project and worked. I love a good project myself, and I related to the way they worked. <br />And the sun. I admit that I am a summer girl. I love the way sunlight feels; it has such a comforting protection.

And this story held all the tragedy and romance that I expect and love in her work.<br />My favorite character in this book was Nivea. I loved how she just knew. And the way she believed things. And the way she loved her husband. <br />But the best part of the story was the way love was always portrayed as something that one fights for, fights to keep. That commitment is renewed each day, that it can not be taken for granted. Love isn't easy. That's the message that I took from this book, and I very much agree with that sentiment. The best things are never easy.<br />Aurora's passion for photography was wonderful to read about, and I related to a lot of what she felt throughout her story. Every word of her story felt like it was a struggle for her to write, and I appreciated her words. I appreciated the way she spoke of writing as that which would make the story more real. &quot;Memory is fiction&quot; and this is why we write our stories this way. <br />I quite liked this story.	2003-12-14

Put all these characters together and there I will be. Atwood writes in such an intimate way that I was drawn closely to these people and all that they had.<br />This story was well-told and quiet. It had a somewhat disjointed feel as the days were slightly mixed up. This is a book of secrets, and as such, I could see myself in it everywhere. Each word was unspoken in a way that I would unspeak it, and that held a certain sense of comfort. It was like the story was being told as the secrets could no longer be held in. Like it was all leaking out, and it was all just resigned to be leaking at this point. Because there were no choices left.<br />I felt dragged through to the end, but I believe this was intentional. Or I'd like to think that it was.	2003-12-14

With about a fourth of the book left, I skipped to the end and read it backwards. Glad for an ending that seemed hopeful. This time I read the book normally, knowing what would happen and not as worried for an end I couldn't read.<br />The poetry in this book traces out a past that almost feels like it could be mine. Yours. Any readers. I read a review of this book where the reader complained that memory does not work this way. That the story is ridiculous for it's portrayal of repressed memories. I don't know the truth of that, and I don't care to. This book is not about repressed memories as much as it is about confronting our fears. Reaching deep inside of ourselves, through all sorts of darkness, to find whatever hope and love and beauty that we can.<br />This book is beautiful. It is entirely characterized by this quotation: \\"A conspiracy of language gently bending my perception in a more hopeful arc.\\" I found hope in this book. <br />It reminded me to focus on the things that I love rather than the things that I fear.

You may shake your head more than once throughout as you wonder what you may have missed.  But, unlike the only other review that is currently posted, I intend to say positive things about the book.<br />1. Will's descriptions of what it feels like to be an outcast are wonderful.  I speak to you as someone who was formerly known as invisiblegirl, so I know what Will was saying.  And the way he said it, it was beyond merely true.  True isn't a strong enough word.  I felt what Will was saying when he said, &quot;People are nearby, in front of your face or working shoulder to shoulder or whatever it is, but they are never ever really with you, are they?  Nearby, that's the best they can ever be.&quot;  <br />2.  The book moves quickly which may feed to the confusion, but the story has a slow feel to it.  You are inside Will's mind, the mind of a disturbed young man.  There is a certain slowness that comes across in Will's thoughts that counteracts the fast pace of the book.  The result is that the reader is able to get to know Will through the inner dialogue, his voices if you will.  I feel that this &quot;experiment&quot; of the second person was well done.  It accomplished what it set out to do, in my mind anyway.<br />3.  This isn't your standard book, but it is worth the read if you choose not to be put off by the fact that the events of the novel are not really all that important.  It may sound like they are when you're describing to book: 'a series of teen suicides leaves a young man wondering if he caused their deaths unknowingly.'  Sounds like some kinds of a psychological thriller, doesn't it?  It isn't.  It is psychological all right, but not a thriller by any means.  This book is an opportunity to really get inside a characters head, in a way that few other books allow.<br />I suggest you read it and decide how well you know yourself.	2001-11-16

She was such an engaging speaker that I immediately wanted to read her books.  <br />I was not disappointed with Rules of the Road.  It was quite funny, and I would recommend it to anyone who has had a demeaning job that they loved and were good at (i.e. selling shoes (in the book) or waiting tables (in my life)).	2001-11-06

How could I resist.<br />However, the book was pretty didactic.  <br />I enjoyed it for its depiction of a reader. I found the girl's thoughts on books and reading to be quite believable and even memorable. But on the whole, I felt like this book sacrificed what could have been a good story for the point the author wanted to make about censorship. <br />But, hey.  Read it.  Books are good.	2001-11-06

He said &quot;it is incredibly life-affirming.&quot; <br />A week later, he asked if I had started it yet. &quot;Started it?&quot; I asked, &quot;I just finished it yesterday.&quot; <br />&quot;What did you honestly think of it?&quot; he asked eagerly.<br />This is pretty much what I told him:<br />This wonderfully poetic novel follows the Buendia family in a way that is at times deeply touching, terribly amusing, and genuinely tragic. The book reads like a dream: slow, circuitous, confusing, beautiful, enchanting, disturbing. I could list adjectives forever, but I won't. I'll just say that this book represented some of the best prose I have ever read. Garcia Marquez takes the reader through one hundred years with an amazing touch that makes the magic feel so real. <br />on that note: read this book. it is well worth it.	2001-11-06

I thought &quot;This is never going to work.  I am going to hate this book.&quot;<br />Well, I was wrong.  I LOVED this book.  I am frantically recommending it to everyone I know because of the unique way it presented one boy's fascination with poetry.  <br />Even if you think you'd hate a book written in poems, I recommend reading this book because the story sucks you in, despite any trepidation you may have about the format.  It is a very quick read, and well worth it.	2001-10-23

But this book was disappointing. There were so many identity changes that it just got tedious.  By the end, I really didn't care about the big revelation as to the whole identity problem.  I just wanted to finish the book and move on.<br />Also I am almost never swift enough to guess the end before the author wants me to know, but in this book the &quot;surprise&quot; ending was painfully obvious very early on. <br />I did, however, think that the future presented in the book was interesting for those who like speculative futures.  I wouldn't write the book off entirely just on the basis of the description of the future.  There is also a lot of action, which may entice some into reading it.	2001-09-19

The first chapter was hard to get into for me, but after that I was hooked.  <br />The story of sleeping beauty that is weaved throughout gives the book a continuity that helps the reader believe that Gemma could really be Briar Rose.  Then when the real story is revealed of what happened to Gemma, all becomes plausible again for the princess lived basically a happy life, which is as close to &quot;happily ever after&quot; as we can really get.<br />If you like this book, do see the movie &quot;Ever After&quot;  which is based on the fairy tale of Cinderella.	2001-09-19

It changed the way I thought about learning, thinking, and living when I read it, and I was out of high school at the time.  I was even a former homeschooler, but this book still presented ideas that were new to me.  TTLH has had a profound impact on the way I experience education, and that has stayed with me throughout college and graduate school.<br />What am I saying: This book is inspiring.  If you want to be inspired, read it.  If you prefer to remain inspiration-less, don't read it.  This book will change you, but you have to let it.  It will do nothing if you refuse to let it.  I know.  I recommended this book to everyone I knew, but no one took to it like I did.  Not a single person.  Most people just thought I was an idiot for talking about &quot;unschooling&quot; and &quot;self education.&quot; <br />Every time I used the word &quot;autodidact&quot; I got a strange look.<br />Sometimes that's how you tell the really good books... the strange looks you get when you talk about them.<br />The original edition is much, much better than the newer version because it is more comprehensive and more real.  It feels more honest.  But even if you read the flashier edition, take the ideas to heart.  Consider them.	2001-09-19

There were long stretches where I was utterly confused about what was going on or why the author was telling me such things interspersed with really beautiful descriptions or some other really satisfying passage that was truly enjoyable.<br />Do I recommend this book?  Sure.  Just remember that the disjointed feeling is intentional.  If that sort of thing does not put you off, then you will enjoy this book for the hidden treasures it contains.<br />I can also say that despite the fact that Maria &quot;sleeps around&quot; quite a bit, it was not sexually explicit.  I appreciated this.  I get so sick of reading books that boldly refuse to leave any of the details to the imagination (or not as the reader chooses).	2001-09-19

I thought that many of Doreen's words were wonderful in a way that I can't even describe. At times, I found the narration confusing, but I think it was intentional, and I think it works well enough. <br />Being fourteen was captured in these pages in a way that I have only encountered better in Harley Like a Person by Cat Bauer.  This book is more serious, more adult than Harley, and as such it also captures something else, something more disturbing than Bauer did in Harley Like a Person.<br />I didn't really feel that Doreen had become a &quot;brave new girl&quot; by the end of the book. I can see how she would think of herself that way though. She had, however, been through a lot, so I am willing to give her the the title &quot;brave new girl&quot; if she wants it.	2001-09-19

It is perfect for people like me, who are fascinated by the idea of time travel but can't understand math or physics for anything.  The first few chapters are basically a literature review.  An extremely comprehensive literature review.  It'll be enough to make you run to your library or bookstore (or computer) in search of these books and short stories.  <br />Nahin also discusses the reality behind time travel with relatively little math.  Most of the math is tucked away in the &quot;Tech Notes in the back of the book.  Nice technique to sucker in the math-scaredys like me.  <br />What I really loved about the book, though is Nahin's enthusiasm.  He is obviously just as nuts (or more) as I am about this outlandish subject of time travel, which makes the book, in my opinion, stand-out.	2001-09-19

Who knew Dadaism could be so funny? <br />The son of an astronaut deals with his father's fame, his intellect, and his girlfriend in this novel. Steve's determination to stay out of the yearbook teamed up with Doug's determination to get in the yearbook, causes them to found the Grace Order of Dadaists (GOD), the epitome of the anti-popularity high school sentiment. <br />If you like this book, see also Stargirl by Jerry Spinelli or Whale Talk by Chris Crutcher.  Those books also deal with popularity and conformity in high school.  All three books deal with these subjects (and others) remarkably well.<br />The best thing about Rats Saw God, though, is the title.  When people ask you what you're reading, and you say Rats Saw God... be prepared for a strange look.  But if you try to explain what it means, the look will just get stranger.  That sort of thing makes my day.	2001-09-19
US	42121772	R39Y5DCQCCDL9M	0849937221	320503501	The Amber Photograph	Books	1	2	7	N	N	a chance	I picked this book up because it was around.  It isn't my usual fare by any means.  Although the book kept my attention, I was disappointed.  <br />For three basic reasons:<BR>1. The author is very definately a Christian, and at the end of the book all the characters, except the completely unredeemable, &quot;find God.&quot;  I found this exceedingly contrived and unnecessary.<br />2. My other gripe with the book is with the characters.  They all take what I considered shocking news relatively in stride.  Most people's reaction could take up a whole book and not be complete, but this book condensed it into a few pages of unbelievable drivel.  <br />3. The chapters are broken up in very strange places.  I usually expect a chapter break to signal the end of a scene, but in this book, chapters were always breaking into the scene.  I found this distracting at first, then irritating near the end.  I think this was done because the author thought that she was surprising the reader with all these &quot;revelations&quot; and &quot;plot twists.&quot;  Well, I have news for the author, the revelations were excrutiatingly obvious from the beginning.  The book proceeded exactly according to formula.	2001-09-17

In this book, Marjan has a deformed foot.  <br />The book is particularly interesting because of the guilt associated with the disability due to the reason behind it.  Like any good book directed at youths, though, the guilt is resolved by the end, and Marjan is quite suddenly able to look at herself through new eyes.<br />I say all of that somewhat sarcastically, but this book does have some good points.  Marjan is a strong young woman (despite, or because of, her disability), and I applaud that.  The book is also an interesting look at Sheherazade (the book spells it Shahrazad), who many young girls may not know about.  Shahrazad is presented as a heroine for the ages, brave beyond belief, saving the lives of countless young women in the city.  <br />However, the book is extremely didactic in nature.  Be prepared to take some elements with a grain of salt.  For example, at the end of the book, Marjan realizes that a certain repented evildoer is &quot;cirppled with guilt&quot; as she is crippled by her disability.  If you can ignore obvious efforts at teaching like that, then this book will be great, especially for young women to learn about Persian/women's history.	2001-09-17

Then I picked up Harley Like a Person, and that was that.  Harley is a far superior book in terms of capturing that teen voice.  Not that I am an expert on what it is like to be a teenager, but I know what feels real to me.<br />Harley's dilemma is the kind of dilemma that is common in youth fiction: she doesn't like her family and she thinks she is adopted.  But that's where the formulaic young adult novel ends and Harley's adventure begins.<br />I highly recommend this book to everyone who remembers being fourteen.  Who remembers fighting with your parents even when you knew full well that it was not smart.  Who remembers being in high school.  Who remembers when your family was alien to you.<br />One of the editorial blurbs of the book says it best, &quot;Harley's a real person.&quot;  That is so true.	2001-09-17

I could.  And that would be fine because the book is about those things.  In fact, it speaks about those things really well.<br />But what else it does really well, if less prominently, is talk about disabilities.  One of the swimmers on the team has one leg.  This is incredibly important because there are not a lot of books out there that depict limb deficient people realistically (or at all).  <br />If you're looking for a book that deals with disability, but isn't outrageously didactic, this is a good book.  I have spent a lot of time looking at the portrayal of people with disabilities in young adult fiction, and I would definately put this book on my list of &quot;recommended disability fiction.&quot;<br />The end of the book, which I certainly would not dream of giving away, is so freakin' cool I laughed out loud, not from amusement so much as a strange feeling of triumph.  I don't think I can explain how much this book meant to me.	2001-09-06
US	42121772	RIC2G09R6W1SL	014028642X	523529497	Alice Springs	Books	4	4	6	N	N	Solemnity	At the end of my edition there were a number of questions for discussion that asked English major-type questions.  The questions made me laugh because the book was so real on its own, and the questions made it all seem so articifial.  <br />And that is the real issue of the book, I think.  What is real and what is artificial.  Snip worries about whether what she feels for Dave is real love or infatuation. She spends the entire book discovering the reality behind her family, particularly her father.  She feels like she really belongs in the community, but she doesn't feel like she can paint there.  <br />This is a good book mostly for the unique phrasings.  I like the way Gemmell uses language throughout.  She knows how to choose a word.  Don't be fooled, though.  This book is rough.  Its themes and language are not for the tenderhearted.  I have to say, though, that I think it is rough in a good way.	2001-09-06

They don't even have to be any good.  I'll still read them, and probably like them.  <br />This book, however, is quite good. It takes the time-slip convention and turns it into a scientific &quot;fact&quot; by giving it a fancy sounding name: dechronization.  Just the fact that it uses a pseudo-term like that would make it a favorite with me even if it was written in gibberish, but I have a thing about neology.  Since reading this book, I have started slipping the word &quot;dechronization&quot; and all its variants into conversation whenever possible.  It is my hope that one day this word will be common koine.<br />The other notable point of this book the reaction of Magruder to the dechronization.  Since he is a chronologist, he knows that the chances of his being re-dechronized are beyond impossible.  So he has absolutely no chance of seeing another person.  Ever.  But he doesn't give in to the hopelessness that I know I would feel.  He continues to live.  He takes a lesson from Robinson Crusoe, and makes a good life there in the middle of nowhere (or in this case nowhen).<br />All in all, I think this is a must-read for wannabe time travelers like myself.  Or maybe just anyone who likes the linguistic oddities inherent in time travel.	2001-09-06
