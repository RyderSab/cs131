A well-orchestrated women's ministry is like a beautiful dance, bringing grace and creativity to the Body of Christ. In Building an Effective Women's Ministry, gifted author Sharon Jaynes not only teaches the basic dance steps, but all the intricate footwork that prepares women to have Scripturally \\"beautiful feet\\" in order to share Christ's Gospel of peace. In chapters like \\"Defining Your Purpose,\\" \\"Servant Leadership,\\" \\"Utilizing God-Given Abilities,\\" \\"Encouraging the Team,\\" \\"Lifestyle Evangelism,\\" and \\"Dividing and Multiplying,\\" Jaynes encourages women to glide across the dance floor of life, following their partner Jesus' lead. And with her trademark practical, powerful, and persuasive writing, Sharon Jaynes continues to lead the way in helping women to draw strength from Christ and, in turn, strengthen others in Him. I highly recommend this thoroughly comprehensive guide to women's ministries. Your women, your church, and your community need the potent principles outlined in this wonderful book.

With rare giftedness and vulnerable candor, Carol Kent opens her life and her heart in a way that few authors dare. She shares her anguish over the heart-wrenching journey of her only son, Jason, a strong Christian and U.S. Naval Academy graduate, who was sentenced to life imprisonment for first-degree murder. While Kent never excuses the sin, she explains the difficult circumstances and emotional <br />complications which led to the commission of her son's act. Often Christians too easily condemn the sinner along with the sin. As only a mother can, Kent helps us embrace her son's <br />humanness and, in the process, our own. As I read her account, I realized \\"there but for the grace of God go I.\\"  Carol looks to Jesus for the assurance of Jason's redemption. It's the only <br />place any of us can look for forgiveness. And as Carol, herself, gazed at her Savior, she realized that Jesus could bring beauty from the ashes of her son's devastating life-sentence-one <br />which in a sense she, as his parent, shares with him. Now Carol and her husband, Gene, spend their lives in helping the oft-ostracized families of prisoners, bringing them Christ's love <br />through a new ministry, Speak Up for Hope. Praise God that despite Carol's deep loss and initial doubts, she is speaking up for others who can't. As you read this life-changing book, <br />you'll realize that when you lay your Isaac down, the only place you, too, can look is up. It's then that you will see the brilliance of God's glory as the Kents and Jason have. <br />--Lynn D.

Authors Sharon Jaynes and Lysa <br />TerKeurst have opened floodgates of wisdom by employing a fascinating metaphor about seven \\"principle-pools\\" from which women can dip for refreshment and refocusing on their God- <br />given roles and responsibilities. Using the \\"Proverbs Thirty-One Woman\\" as their  model, they encourage and enable women to prioritize and reach realistic goals for revering Jesus, <br />honoring their husbands, nurturing their relationships with their children and friends, creating welcoming homes, and contributing to their communities. They write with incredible passion and often surprising poignancy, as they reveal the depths of their hearts. One thing is certain: Sharon and Lysa have dipped their pens into living water, writing an inspired book whose ripples will be felt for years to come.

Her humorous reflections cause prolonged, hysterical <br />laughter-kind of like having hilarity hiccups: Once you start chuckling at her work, it's nearly impossible to stop.  What's not to like or laugh at about this tiny tome of high-class humor? St. John-Gilbert is a real writer, whose verbiage is pithy and pert, sophisticated and saucey. She employs a refreshingly intelligent vocabulary with polish and pizzazz. And her humor? Well, it's offbeat and off the wall! And you will need more than a wall to hold you up as you double up in side-splitting laughter while reading about her Seinfeldish antics with a Christ-centered twist. You may start out giggling, but you will go away pondering, then applying sound Biblical principles to situations you are experiencing in your own life. And thanks to St.John-Gilbert, you can do so with a smile. Everyone needs to laugh more, but not just for the sake of it. Rachel knows the secret-that God is the ultimate Laugh-Giver. The laughter that He gives, even paradoxically in the midst of difficult  circumstances, is really the laughter of joy. It truly warms my heart to know that Rachel St. John-Gilbert, the Queen of Quirk, loves the King of Kings.

Until we understand that our personal interior, our heart, is meant to reflect God's design, our houses cannot possibly reflect their true purpose.

Ideas are easy to read, simple to accomplish, and possible to afford (especially for someone who is decorating-challenged like me!)

Enter mentor par excellence, Betty Southard,<BR>via her wonderful new book, The Mentor Quest, that I received as a gift. In a matter of hours<BR>as I sped my way through this challenging book, without ever having to leave my chair, I met<BR>an extended host of helpers at-the-ready with inspiration and information to guide and grace<BR>my life. With an innovative twist, while not disregarding typical mentorial relationships,<BR>Southard opened [what she calls] my \\"mentoring eyes\\" to behold a vast array of educators<BR>within easy reach, if I would but reach out.  Once she challenged me to \\"be alert to life\\" I saw<BR>a mosaic of mentors coloring my life-besides typical sources like teachers, pastors, parents,<BR>and friends, there were the Bible and Bible studies, books, TV, radio, movies, conferences,<BR>speakers, web sites, e-mentoring over e-mail, and lessons learned from life-circumstances, to<BR>name just some. With Southard's encouragement and equipping, I know I could find a mentor-<BR>a-minute if I take responsibility to keep looking through mentor-colored glasses with an alert<BR>attitude and a grateful heart.       <BR>-Lynn D.

Having been in the work-force as a professional for<BR>twenty years and not knowing beans about children, I was at a real loss. Thankfully my<BR>daughter is just ten and I'm a quick study. Thank you, Jill Savage, for arriving in the nick of<BR>time with tons of encouragement, education, and enabling. I have never read a \\"mothering\\"<br />book before which recognizes motherhood as a vital and viable profession. Savage understands<BR>\\"profession\\" in its purest, original meaning: an occupation requiring considerable training and<BR>specialized study; an act of faith or belief in something important, as in professing something<BR>we espouse with all our hearts. In the truest sense, a profession has nothing to do with earning<BR>money. And Savage helps us realize that no price tag could be put on motherhood anyway; our<BR>contribution is invaluable! She helps mothers understand their worth in Christ and the<BR>worthiness of their role. She encourages us to take our jobs seriously as any professional<BR>would by employing goals, mission statements, organizational skills, planning strategies,<BR>networking, etc. Wow! What a refreshing way to mentor mothers-with a little business-savvy<BR>for the most important business in which they will ever engage! Yes, she also mentions diapers<BR>and dishpans, but with the underlying knowledge that even seeming \\"drudgery\\" takes on great<BR>meaning when done with great purpose-to make our families secure. Savage has written a<BR>sparkling gem that lights a mother's heart-that makes this mother glad she took her heart<BR>home to stay!<BR>-Lynn D. Morrissey, author &amp; speaker	2002-07-26

Ferris Wheels, Daffodils, & Hot Fudge Sundaes Book Review<br />In her beautiful new gratitude journal, Ferris Wheels, daffodils, & Hot Fudge Sundaes, Laura Jensen Walker has managed to capture life's bountiful blessings in a litany of delightful lists for our observation and celebration. I must admit that at first glance I couldn't imagine the big deal about a listing of seemingly incongruous information. And admittedly, I wasn't having a very good day. But by the time I'd read a couple pages, I was laughing, crying, and praising God. In a deceptively simply way, reading a blessing list has a cumulative, exponential effect. By the time I was finished, I was not only blessed, but  adding my own personal joys. And that's the point. By proving to readers that blessings abound in our lives, from the overwhelmingly obvious, to the present but overlooked, to the definitely obscure, we are encouraged to \\"take note\\" and  come away profoundly grateful to God for all of life. Walker knows about treasures found in darkness. She started her list while undergoing chemotherapy for life-threatening breast cancer, yet found reasons for praise. After reading the blessings she found in her \\"dark night,\\" I came away knowing that God could bless me in any situation. I am thankful to Walker for the prompt to count my blessings and grateful to the God who supplies them. Because I have a feeling my journal will fill quickly, I've got several blank notebooks waiting in the wings!	2002-02-21

Authors Sharon Jaynes and Lysa<BR>TerKeurst have opened floodgates of wisdom by employing a fascinating metaphor about seven<BR>\\"principle-pools\\" from which women can dip for refreshment and refocusing on their God-<BR>given roles and responsibilities. Using the \\"Proverbs Thirty-One Woman\\" as their  model,<BR>they encourage and enable women to prioritize and reach realistic goals for revering Jesus,<BR>honoring their husbands, nurturing their relationships with their children and friends, creating<BR>welcoming homes, and contributing to their communities. They write with incredible passion<BR>and often surprising poignancy, as they reveal the depths of their hearts. One thing is certain:<BR>Sharon and Lysa have dipped their pens into living water, writing an inspired book whose<BR>ripples will be felt for years to come. As they prepare women to become vessels into which the<BR>Spirit of the living Christ is poured, His blessings will overflow to the lives they touch, and<BR>continue cascading throughout the generations.   <br />-Lynn D.

I couldn't imagine reading an entire book on the subject. What's the big deal anyway? You just put one foot in front of the other and talk to God. Yet Janet has written a challenging, interesting, and resourceful handbook that not only engages  readers mentally, but fully equips them to become spiritually and physically fit, as well.  Janet covers miles of ground from her personal struggles and victories with both prayer and exercise, to well-documented health information, to choosing foot gear and prayer partners, to understanding specific aspects of prayer, to mapping out a detailed prayer strategy for one's entire community. Surprisingly, she also includes humor and pathos; and there is sometimes a poetic lyricism to her writing.<br />Before reading Prayerwalk, I had to muster bootstrap determination to pray. Now I just lace up my tennies, open my heart, hit the road, and talk to God! Though occasionally I run out of breath, thanks to Janet, now I never run out of prayer topics or inspiration!<br />Lynn D. Morrissey Author &amp; Speaker	2001-07-15
