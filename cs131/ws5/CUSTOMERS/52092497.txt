This book proves that belief to be very wrong.<br />The confrontation between Ludwig Wittgenstein and Carl Popper in October of 1946 is a minor footnote in the history of philosophy, but it provides a foil for the authors to explore the histories of these two men and the world in which they lived.<br />After setting the stage by describing the confrontation, the authors turn to an examination of the lives of the two philosophers, both from Vienna, both powerful intellects, both giant egos. The emphasis here is on historical context, not on philosophy, so the story is very accessible to the general reader. The account of their lives before World War II is fascinating. The description of the academic world in which they worked is vividly drawn. <br />The authors have given us a real sense of who these two men were and have introduced the reader to the supporting cast of characters as well. The authors have wisely avoid an analysis of the sexual lives of the two protagonists, though Wittgenstein's personal life is alluded to at a couple of points.<br />The philosophical issues are presented late in the book and are explained carefully and simply, so that the lay reader will see the intellecual stakes involved in the argument. While both men are presented as driven, they are sympathetically portrayed and within the context of the lives they lived, seem quite compelling. <br />This book captured for me the feeling of being there and gave me a real sense of time and place. The book is short but compelling. I recommend it highly for the reader interested in the lives of intellectuals mid Twentieth Century.	2002-05-30

Many of those complaints I agree with, at least to some extent. However, to carp about this book is to miss the purpose of the enterprise. This is an excellent overview of American foreign policy, and those who were responsible for it, in a period of time when foreign policy was the last thing on the minds of everyone, including the President of the United States.<br />Halberstam gives a very readable account of the events leading up to and during the Clinton presidency. He vividly captures the personalities involved, and compellingly shows how little attention was being paid, how many competing interests existed and how fitful was our concentration on the important issues of the post-Cold War world.<br />It is entertaining, perplexing and scary to think that events of the magnitude of world affairs over this period of time were being attended to in such an intermittent and cavalier fashion.<br />Well worth reading!	2002-05-30

Legions of very bright people have taken a stab at the problem, to little or no avail. Sadly, I am unable to resist the temptation to read yet another discussion on the subject, even though I know I will come away frustrated.<br />My reservations notwithstanding, this book turned out to contain some genuinely interesting, as well as sensible, thinking on the operation of the human brain. His theory is well grounded in common sense, and is developed carefully. Humphrey's approach is a good one: How might the human brain have evolved to create consciousness from primitive antecedents? <br />Central to Hamphrey's theory is the distinction between sensation and perception, that is to say the difference between the subjective sensations that we experience versus the awareness of some external object. This argument takes a considerable length of time for Humphrey to unpack, and there were moments where I doubted that the distinction was worth the care that Humphrey lavished upon it. However, at the end of the day, it is worth wading through this discussion in order to fully understand this key element of Humphrey's idea.<br />The critical leap occurs when Humphrey postulate the existence of &quot;reverbatory feedback loops.&quot; Under this theory, consciousness arises when sensory information is shuttled between the nervous system and the brain repeatedly. This mechanism would give temporal continuity to sensation and might well be the foundation for consciousness.<br />Whether or not you buy this theory, you will be interested to follow Humphrey through the steps that allow him to get to the conclusion. There are numerous simple examples drawn from a broad range of disciplines, that will give you insight into the human brain, even if you resist the final conclusion. However, once you see the theory in its final form, it is pretty beguiling. In fact, Humphrey actually concludeswith a discussion of whether the theory is &quot;too simple.&quot;<br />If this is an area that appeals to you at all, this is a book worth reading!	2002-05-30

Whether one is a professional philosopher (whatever that means), or a casual reader, any discussion of philosophy requires familiarity with a huge number of specialized terms. A philosophical dictionary allows the reader to quickly ground himself in the vocabulary without losing the train of thought.<br />The various encyclopedias of philosophy are more comprehensive, but they serve a completely different purpose. If you are looking for in depth analysis, turn to an encyclopedia, but for a quick definition, this volume is perfect. The entries contain just the perfect amount of information. You are quickly gotten up to speed, without bogging down in endless peripheral issues.<br />In short, a valuable supplement to philosophical studies, both for the novice and for the more experienced reader of philosophical texts.	2002-05-28

He is best known as skeptic and debunker, usually in reviews for NY Review of Books, and in columns in various magazines, most notably Scientific American. Like Stephen Jay Gould, he has a tremendous intellectual range and can make anything interesting, including topics that you believe you could not possibly care about prior to reading Gardner on the subject.<br />All of Gardner's compilations are worth reading and may represent a better introduction to Gardner's thought than the present volume. Nevertheless, this book has a charm that cannot be denied. The book is unlike anything else I have ever read. It is basically a series of musings about various philosophical issues: free will, evil, economics, politics and the nature of god. Gardner begins by giving a simple, understandable summary of the area, including the arguments of the great thinkers on the subject. Gardner then moves to a thorough analysis of the weight of the arguments, and concludes with his own position on the issue. <br />In general reading this book has the feel of being included in the private musings of a great intellect. Gardner is careful to develop his arguments thoroughly and simply so that the neophyte philosopher will not be left behind. (Though in fairness, some terms are not defined, an a Dictionary of Philosophy would be useful in getting the casual reader up to speed.)<br />Gardner's style is charming. He takes up a topic such as determinism versus free will and examines the philosophical arguments that have been raised against the existence of free will. Having admitted the power of the arguments arrayed against free will, Gardner confesses that he believes in free will anyway. And so it goes for arguments against the existence of God, immortality, prayer, etc., in every case confessing that the rational arguments favor positions contrary to his own, and then maintaining them anyway.<br />Gardner is a \\"fideist,\\" meaning that he acknowledges the impossibility of demonstrating rationally the existence of God and related issues, but insisting that faith is an appropriate mechanism for getting around these difficulties. Gardner is never heavy-handed or preachy in his positions, and he gives the arguments against him a fair hearing. <br />The joy of reading this book is that the issues are so clearly presented that the reader can assess his own thoughts on the subject. I personally do not buy fideism as a justification for abandoning reason, but the book presented the alternative views so well that I felt comfortable disagreeing with Gardner in his conclusion.<br />In the end, fideism is an interesting point of view. It does not require the destruction of arguments against one's belief in God. In fact, the fideist can revel in the irrationality of his position. While the reader may not be convinced to believe as Gardner does, I will bet you will come away with a better grasp of the issues involved.	2002-05-28

Sadly, this is not the first time that philosophy has been ill-served by attempts at popularization. This is yet another example of a popular text that attempts to \\"dumb down\\" the philosophy of the great philosophers and purports to extract popular moral lessons from them. This leaves a profound misimpression of what philosophy is all about.<br />In fairness, this approach almost works with Seneca and Epicurus, who must be seen as practical lifestyle \\"gurus\\" in the manner of afternoon talk show lifestyle advice. It is less illuminating for the likes of Schopenhauer and Nietzche.<br />Sadly, in trying to derive comfort from individual philosophers,it is necessary to ignore most of the serious thinkers in favor of others, who, while admirable at a certain level, distort the understanding of what philosophical thinking is all about.<br />The real consolation of philosophy is the oppurtunity to contemplate clearly the meaning of the important questions of life and our place in the universe. This consolation is best sought elsewhere.	2002-05-28

Still it must be possible to give the non-specialist reader the flavor of the insights of the great thinkers without totally trivializing it. Diamond is sometimes clever and occasionally insightful, but the device of reducing great thought to a sit-com epigram trivializes the thinking of the greatest minds of our generation.<br />The inability to give insight into great thought is not surprising, given the brevity of the chapters. I don't want to sound too stuffy, but what is the use of attempting to summarize the great philosophers if the format is too brief to give the reader any insight at all into why these thinkers are important.<br />Interestingly, this book is probably more entertaining if you are already familar with the philosophers discussed, since you can chuckle at the humor of the caricature. For the rest of us, everything of interest has been left out for the sake of the wit. What is more, there are precious few \\"Lessons for Living,\\" and little or no \\"Other Philosophic Musing.\\"<br />Sadly, the bibliography is too lame to even point the inquisitive reader in the direction of more substantive discussion of the issues. (In fairness, Diamond's two recommendations are good ones: Russell's History of Western Philosophy and Plato's Republic will give the reader the sense of what philosophy is truly about.)	2002-05-28

As a liberal, I had hoped that David Brock would have some insight into where he went wrong in his sojourne with the extreme right. As a citizen, I hoped that Brock would shed some light on the prevalence of political hatchet jobs from both extremes. Sadly, this book contained little of either. <br />Brock never gives us any insight into his own mistakes and never has anything beyond the most facile explanations for how he got involved in spreading malicious falsehoods and half-truths without regard for the damage done. In short, Brock has given us some juicy gossip, but little regret and no substance.<br />While Brock has now bitten the hand the fed him (the Right), he gives precious little comfort for moderates or liberals, because he demonstrates how little genuine remorse he feels for his past misdeeds. The story of how well financed hatchet-men have sabotaged the political landscape, making it impossible to arrive at political censensus on the important issues that confront us is an important one, well worth telling.

Is our behavior genetically dictated? If so, what can (or should) we do about it? This book actually makes some headway in resolving these questions and others like them and has the added attraction of giving you a survey of the science in this area.<br />This book sat on my coffee table unread for six months because I harbored two opposing fears about reading it: On the one hand, I thought that the technical scientific details would be daunting, and on the other, I feared that this was an area that was not capable of intellectual resolution, that nothing of importance to understanding the human condition could be learned in this area. I was wrong on both counts. This book is a great introduction to what science has learned about the role of genes in human behavior and it is presented in a manner comprehensible to the lay reader.<br />The first half of the book is devoted to the study of the behavior of comparatively simple creatures, round worms, Drosophila, sea slugs, etc. By analyzing simplified nervous systems, the authors are able to explore some simple relationships between genes and behavior. Then, in the second half, these same relationships are explored in more advanced creatures and in humans. The authors make clear the limits of the extension of these principles to more complex settings, but they were able to convince me of the appropriateness of the application of these studies to more complex species. <br />The conclusions that the authors draw are not simplistic. The complex interplay of neurotransmitters is effectively developed and the possibility of multiple behavioral and neural antecedents to behavior is acknowledged. Still the same the reader will be awed, both by the genetic and neural science and by the implications for the human condition.<br />In short, this is exactly the kind of book that will rock you back inyour chair, stunned by the complexity and wonder that is the human neurological system.	2002-05-21

Harris takes all of the recent developmental psychology studies and shows that the don't demonstrate what we think they do. Harris' theory is a simple one: While \\"nurture\\" contributes substantially to the composition of the personality and character of a child, the parent turns out to be only a small part of that mix. This flies in the face of all of our cherished beliefs about modern parenting, quality time, loving guidance, and positive discipline. <br />I was prepared to resist Harris' thesis to the death, but I found her arguments compelling. In the end, she won me over: If you look at the studies, if you examine your common sense notions, if you look at the way primitive societies raise their children, and if you do so without preconception, it is reasonable to believe that parental rearing styles are only a very small factor in how children turn out.<br />This is both comforting and scary. It is comforting because it removes a lot of the pressure to be the \\"perfect parent\\" and it is scary, because it shows how little control you truly have as a parent.<br />In short, this is not just another \\"parenting\\" book, it may force you to throw away most of the parenting books you already own.<br />Highly recommended!	2002-05-17

Anthropomorphism is the attribution of human characteristics to non-human things or events. It turns out that the human brain is designed to project human characteristics on the world around us (Hence, the title &quot;Faces in the Clouds&quot;, a reference to the human propensity to see human faces everywhere in the world.)<br />Guthrie is at his best showing the reader exactly how pervasive our anthropomorphic projections are. He is careful to develop the philosophical underpinnings as well as to demonstrate with numerous examples the way that anthropomorhism pervades our perceptions. In examples drawn from art, literature and advertising, Guthrie shows the universality of the anthropomorphic model.<br />Guthrie is compelling when he shows that anthropomorphism is actually a &quot;smart&quot; Darwinian strategy as well. Guthrie quite rightly rejects some of the obvious explanations advanced to explain anthropomorphism in favor of an explanation that makes anthropomorphism a valuable diagnostic tool for our environment. Guthrie's contention (and it is probably correct) is that the perception of human activity is the most important of the various interpretions that we can impose on our environment. Because of its central importance, it makes sense to apply that model as broadly as possible. Where other authors have seen anthropomorphism as some sort of embarrassing error pattern, Guthrie makes it central to a successful coping strategy. Further, it is clear that anthropomorphism does not impose a substantial fitness penalty, even when applied inappropriately. Guthrie make a compelling case that anthropomorphism is the single most important cognitive interpretive model.<br />Strangely, the weakest part of this book is the portion that deals with the subject matter of the subtitle: &quot;A New Theory of Religion.&quot; Having built a compelling case that anthropomorphism isTHE fundamental cognitive strategy for humankind to understand and interpret its environment, Guthrie devotes a single strategy to the contention that this phenomenon explains religion as well. Guthrie may well be right, but it this is, as he claims, the central thesis of his book, it deserves a more detailed presentation.<br />Read this book for an eye opening discussion of the importance of anthropomorphism as a cognitive strategy, not for a &quot;new theory of religion.&quot;	2002-05-12

It is not a &quot;how to&quot; book on helping your child learn, but rather is a readable introduction to the current state of the study of cognitive development of babies. If you don't believe that it is possible to know what a baby is thinking, you will be fascinated at the clever experiments that have been constructed to tease out information from a baby's brain. It is surprising who much we can find out about how babies' brains work, and how much that can teach us about the adult human brain.<br />The tone of the book is chatty, but the content is substantial. The authors discuss the philosophers as well as the scientists who are working in this area. I don't suppose that the average new parent is interested in wading into Chomsky, Ryle or Descartes, but this book actually makes it interesting and compelling.<br />The book is broken down into the acquisition of particular mental skills. The authors thesis is that babies learn using, more or less, the scientific method, forming hypotheses and then testing them emperically. (The title of the book is a clever word play, referring to this theory, while simultaneously demonstrating what adult scientists are learning from their empirical studies.) While this may seem pretensious, the authors actually make a pretty good case for this theory.<br />The acquisition of language deviates somewhat from this general theoretical method, but the authors have some fascinating experimental data to illustrate the way babies actually learn language.<br />In short, this book is highly recommended, not just to new parents, but also to anyone interested in childhood cognitive development or what can be known about the workings of the human brain.	2002-05-12

The analysis is good, and a few of the points made are original to this book.<br />My only reservations have to do with its breathless style and the approach that Christianity must be judged by the gloss that has been put on it by more traditional Christian theologians. A more rational conclusion would be that the various Christian sects have each put their own &quot;spin&quot; on the New Testament teachings of Christ.<br />In short, this book is yet another good example of how easy it is to demonstrate inadequacies in Mormon &quot;theology.&quot; It may or may not convince you of the superiority of the  various alternative &quot;Christian&quot; views that abound.	2002-03-04

It is more than a little surprising that the CIA allowed him to publish, since he is very critical of the agency. Baer makes clear that the problems with the CIA have nothing to do with lack of funding, but rather come from non-existent political interest in the results of intelligence investigation, lack of political support and absence of vision within the agency.<br />This book is a compendium of missed oppurtunities in the last quarter century. Each of the Presidents during this period comes out looking bad in this book. High level executive branch managers are painted as univerally inept and craven.

The current president of the church admitted on a national televison interview that he didn't know much about theology. I have always suspected that the church was unprepared to come to grips with changes in theological positions over the years, and hence, chose to ignore it. Outside analysis has been strident, and frequently generated more heat than light over these issues, leaving the reader to wonder about the fairness of the analysis.<br />Mormonism 101 avoids the combative tone and for the most part, gives accurate positions for Mormon theology. They expose many of the flaws and inconsistencies in Mormon doctrine. Recognize that their analysis is designed to show that Mormonism is not a Christian religion and to sell the reader on the alternative belief system, Christianity, and that the authors' analysis showing that alternative Christian beliefs are somehow better may leave the skeptical reader cold. Those caveats notwithstanding, this is a good introduction to the problems that infest Mormon theological underpinnings. This book is highly recommended, but is less useful as a general introduction to Mormonism than Mormon America by Richard and Joan Ostling, which is the best general introduction to Mormon history, theology and power structure. Nevertheless, well worth reading!	2002-01-06

Shlagel contends that the age of religion is coming to an end and that scientific reasoning will replace it. In a world filled with religious believers flying loaded airliners into crowded buildings and religious sects killing one another from one corner of this planet to the other, it is my belief, sadly, that this will change in my lifetime or any other. Nevertheless, while the reader may reject Schlagel's upbeat conclusions, his analysis of traditional human thought is wonderful.<br />Schlagel combines into one very readable volume a short history of the human species, the developments in Western thought, philosophy, and a critique of the major religious movements. The author makes a compelling case for the inadequacy of religious thought and for the superiority of the scientific method for solving mankind's problems. He does not convince me of the likelihood of that eventuality. <br />The scope of this book is tremendous. I would recommend it highly to the reader prepared to rethink human history in the broadest possible way.

( The Encyclopedia of Bible Errancy by McKinsey, The Bible Handbook by The American Atheists, The Bible According to Mark Twain, The Age of Reason by Thomas Paine, as well as the wonderful stuff by Robert Ingersoll) It is also true that showing inconsistency and immorality in the Bible is not a particularly difficult task. It may also be a fool's errand since believers are unlikely to be swayed, and non-believers already recognize the brutality and immorality frequently portrayed in the Old Testament.<br />Nevertheless, I recommend this book for two reasons: Ludemann describes the scholarly methodology that allows passages to be understood in context and his analysis of anti-semitism in the New Testament. His discussion of anti-Judaism in the Gospels was new to me and very enlightening. Note that Ludemann spends some time discussing Martin Luther and is discussing Luther's translation, rather than the King James or other English translation.<br />Well worth reading along side the other works that I have listed above.	2002-01-06

He is a courageous skeptic, not at all afraid to defend his educated opinion on a subject. His advice on being an independent thinker is good advice for everyone, not just &quot;contrarians.&quot; In a time when voicing questions is regarded as unpatriotic, Hitchings reminds us of the importance of thinking the issues through. This book is an invitation to courageous thought and action. <br />At the same time,Hitchens is not pontifical or bombastic. He is humorous and self-effacing throughout.

Mithen is clearly not in possession of the final answer to questions about our intellectual heritage, but he clearly shows that it is fruitful to consider questions of the etiology of religon, art and science from an archaeological perspective. <br />Mithen shows that there is much more that can be learned from the study of the development of human culture. Moreover, the book  is well illustrated and written in a manner that opens up these concepts to the lay reader. <br />Thought provoking and rewarding, this book makes the long history of mankind and our ancestors seem tangible. Highly recommended!	2001-11-25

In order to evaluate a book on trading, one has to know the experience of the potential reader. This is a book that will be most useful to someone with some background in trading, but not beyond intermediate experience. In addition the title and book jacket may promise the reader more than the book delivers, a common failing in this genre of literature.<br />These caveats aside, this is a solid development of trading techniques. Recognize that Tharp does not solve your trading problems for you, he simply gives you some tools with which to develop your own trading style. All in all, a pretty wise approach.	2001-11-24

Kurtz' organizes the principle clearly and they are compelling. Little argument is marshalled, wisely leaving the reader to figure out how it could be implemented, both in his own life and that of society as a whole. Yes, it is idealistic and envisions worldwide institutions to support improvements, but the vision is so clear and simple that the reader can actually believe that much maligned scientific naturalism could be the basis for a compelling ethical system.<br />Excellent for humanists who may need to be reminded that their chosen life view is a powerful tool for changing the world for the better, as well as for those who do not share that world view and need an introduction to a positive ethical framework.<br />Highly recommended!	2001-11-24

This book is, of course, an attempt to provide for the layman a comprehensive, comprehensible summary of the current state of cognitive neuroscience, not an easy task. Gazzaniga has the credentials to do this, being Director of Cognitive Neuroscience at Dartmouth and the author of several authoritative texts on the subject. <br />The suprise is that he has the capacity to make this palatable for the lay reader. I found his discription of the methodology and the current findings absolutely astounding. To read the clever experiments that pry open the functions of the brain is awe inspiring. The reader can only marvel at the complexity of human mental function, but with an inkling that we have the power to unravel its mysteries.<br />This book clearly demonstrates the progress that we are making in this area. Moreover the study of abnormal brain function is eye-opening in its implications for our understanding of normal brain activity.<br />Well worth reading!	2001-11-24

The book is not a typical &quot;debunker&quot; treatise, it's more philosophy of science.<br />I wasn't always sure where Shermer was headed next, but whether he is wading into the life of Alfred Lord Wallace or considering the effect of birth order in adoption of novel scientific theory, his discussion is absolutely compelling. I would start into a chapter absolutely sure I wasn't interested, only to find myself unable to stop reading until the chapter was over.<br />In fairness, the book is disjointed in that it turns to a variety of loosely related topics with little or no transistion. Still, Shermer makes each topic interesting and, taken as a whole, the book makes a compelling case for the power of science as a tool for interpreting our world. The discussion of Alfred Lord Wallace is marvellous, and includes insights I have read nowhere else.	2001-11-24

The events of September 11th have made the argument of the inevitable progress of mankind seem even less compelling, so my reservations over the thesis of this book remain.<br />The application of game theory to human history is an appealing prospect and Wright's development of game theory and &quot;nonzero sum&quot; games is well done. Unfortunately, Wright's best examples on nonzero sum games are in the area of technology, particularly military technology, and this probably does not represent a meaningly demonstration of human destiny. Worse, Wright insists on defending every historical development as yet further proof of human progress. According to Wright the sack of Rome really wasn't so bad, and the burning of the library at Alexandria was no big deal since somebody else has thought all the ideas in the library since.<br />In fairness, Wright is not an historian and it may be too much to require a rigorous analysis of history, but one expects a more compelling defense of the application of nonzero sum game theory to the vast forces that shape human history. <br />In the end this is a &quot;feel good&quot; book for the casual reader. Sadly, the idea is an interesting one worthy of more rigorous examination that Wright gives it.	2001-11-24

This is due in large part to the resistance of the church he created, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints &quot;Mormons&quot; to real historical scholarship into this era of Mormon history. <br />Persuitte has gone some distance toward rectifying this problem. This book details Smith's life in a neautral and documented fashion. He is particularly good in his detailed analysis of the documents that Smith created in his lifetime, including The Book of Mormon, Pearl of Great Price and what is now called the Doctrine and Covenants. <br />The story is a fascinating read and the reader is given the tools with which to decide about Smith's life and his creations.<br />While I recommend this book very highly, I must say my favorite biography of Smith remains No Man Knows My History by Fawn M. Brodie, a flawed but wonderful account of Smith's life. Very readable!<br />By the way all you believers out there: Lighten Up! The truth can't possibly hurt you.	2001-11-18

Most provide a devasting critique of those beliefs and almost all approach belief in the paranormal in a similiar manner. Humphrey provides some new arguments and insights and hence, Leaps of Faith serves as both a great introduction to skeptical literature and as a source of new insight for people who have already sorted through most of the traditional arguments against the existence of supernatural forces in our daily life.<br />Humphrey's 'Argument from Unwarranted Design' turns out to be an incredible analytical tool and he uses it compellingly in a number of contexts. While most author's content themselves with trotting out the litany of scientific disproofs of the supernatural, Humphrey raises logical objections to alleged paranormal phenomena. Why should strange little phenonoma such as spoon bending bother to exist at all? How and why would they have been created in contravention to the rules of science and the dictates of normally parsimonious design? In short, Humphrey makes a strong case that the supernatural is both empirically AND logically unlikely.<br />One more thing, Humphrey has a very readable style. If the concepts sound complicated and off-putting, they become vivid and immediate as Humphrey gives simple examples and compelling illustrations. Wonderful to read!<br />Buy the book!	2001-11-18

Shermer has done a credible job of this type in this book.<br />Shermer examines a dizzying array of weird beliefs: Near death experiences, alien abductions, Ayn Rand, Edgar Cayce, witchcraft, holocaust deniers, etc. <br />In fairness, all of the topics may not interest all readers. However, this does not take away from reading as Shermer takes apart some particularly irrational belief system. Fun and thought provoking, this is a book worth reading.	2001-11-18

As a scientist who devoted his career to the study of ants, Wilson has blossomed into an intellect capable of shedding light on the most important topics related to the human condition. In his book Sociobiology, Wilson singlehandedly created and defined a new discipline, and structured the context of the debate in that area for the forseeable future. In Consilience, Wilson compelling proposed nothing less than the unification of all branches of knowledge. Wilson simply sees the &quot;big picture&quot; better than anyone else writing today.<br />On Human Nature is a compelling demonstration of the biological and genetics bases for a wide range of human behavior. Whether considering sex, religion, aggression or altruism, Wilson argues convincingly that there is a Darwinian explanation for our behavior. Many will choose to resist his conclusions, but it is important to consider thoughtfully his arguments before moving to another explanation of the behavior of our species.<br />In short, essential reading!	2001-10-17

If you believe that science has no power to shed light on thorny philosophical questions, read this book.

Readers who associate the word &quot;myth&quot; with falsehood may pass this interesting book by. The author has examined the biblical stories that we are all more or less familiar with and located earlier versions of those same stories in other cultures, particularly that of ancient Egypt. The evidence turns out to be surprisingly compelling.<br />This is not a book that attempts to debunk the Bible, but rather treats the stories sympathically. While this approach may offend the strict literalistic reader, other believers will be struck by the mythic power that these stories possess. It is also true that the open-minded reader will be impressed by the evidence that connects Bible stories to earlier accounts of the gods of the Egyptians and others. To me this was fascinating stuff!<br />One more point: The organization of this book makes it very easy to read. By having each chapter deal with a very specific story or &quot;myth&quot; and by presenting the antecedent myths and related evidence with the confines of the chapter, this book is very easy to read. One can turn to any chapter at random and read it with a complete understanding of the author's contention on that particular story. This makes the book an easy and informative read.	2001-05-06

The authors undertake to educate the general reader on the light that modern archaeology can shed on ancient Semitic culture. Their contention, which I find compelling, is that archaeological digs in the Middle East can give us insight into the Biblical text. This book will make you see the stories that you learned as a child in a whole new way. <br />This book will serve both believers and non-believers very well. Whatever perspective you bring to this book, you will come away impressed by the cultural richness and complexity that the archaeolical record reveals. The amazing stories of the Bible become even more amazing when seen in the context of the culture revealed by recent digs.<br />While I recommend this book highly, I have downgraded it to 4 stars because the book lacks charts and maps that would have demonstrated to the casual reader the cultural and political changes in Canaan over time.

My dissatisfaction derives from the fact that this book relies for its substance on the surviving letters of Suor Maria Celeste, Galileo's cloistered daughter. This means that Sobel's book can't concentrate either on the fascinating life of Galileo or the life of the cloistered nun in Italy in the seventeenth century, but rather attempts to recreate the relationship of a father and his daughter through her fawning letters.<br />In fairness, Suor Maria Celeste does seem like a remarkable woman. Her writing style, while cloying, is impressive. Her life was one of incredible privation, and she was amazingly devoted both to her father and to her Saviour. That being said, there is precious little addition insight to be gained from reading the book itself. Suor Maria Celeste's endless exhortations of recourse to faith in God while the Catholic Church, the instrument of God's work on earth attempts to silence her father from saying that the Earth orbits the Sun, seems inexplicable.<br />I wondered if persons of faith, particularly Catholics, might be moved by this attitude, but for us non-believers, the endless upbeat faith in God's goodness in the face of privation and injustice perpetrated in the name of that same God seemed both maddening and mystifying.<br />In short, I came away from this book with no sense of what moved Galileo's daughter. Yes, she clearly loved God and loved her father, but the reader suspected that at the outset. I found little of substance in the book to aid the understanding of the reader for the man, his daughter, their age or their church.	2001-04-05

The arguments from minimum complexity or variations on the blind watchmaker argument have been around for 150 years. These arguments pose a minimum level problem for biologists and are no argument in favor of anything, let alone the Judeo-Christian God of Genesis. <br />Dembski and his fellow advocates of intelligent design have at least come up with a new theory and Dembski is at his best when he discusses information theory as it relates to intelligent design of the universe. Briefly stated, Dembski's theory is that a purely naturalistic system, such as evolution cannot create information, therefore the existence of information in DNA and throughout the living world implies an intelligent creator who imparted that information. Demski actually does a great job of making this sound compelling. However, see Skeptical Inquirer, Marh/April 2001 issue for a critique of his theory.<br />While Dembski's information theory has a certain attraction to it, the theory does little to compell one to adopt the Judeo-Christian deity of Genesis. Indeed, information theory would seem to argue for the deist position, that a deity set the universe in motion and then let it proceed according to the naturalistic laws by which it was created.<br />Indeed, one is struck by the gulf that separates Dembski's discussion of information theory and his discussion of miracles, Moses and the Bible. Dembski is attempting a &quot;bridge&quot; between science and theology, but in the end what he wants is to shoehorn Genesis into contempory biological science. <br />If you are interested in current creationist theory, this book is as good as it gets. He is head and shoulders above Philip E. Johnson and other creationist writers. However, for a complete picture, also read Richard Dawkins, The Blind Watchmaker or The Selfish Gene. For a critique of creationism, try Robert T. Pennocks Tower of Babel and for an introduction to the history of creationist thought in America (Creationism is an American development) read Darwinism Comes to America by Roland L. Numbers.	2001-03-20

In each case Lewontin has chosen a topic of general interest in the general area of the biological sciences and written a survey of the area intended for the general reader. In typical New York Review fashion, this survey is done in the guise of a review of one or more books recently published in the area. <br />The columns are much more survey than book review and serve as excellent introductions to the disciplines for the non-specialist reader. Lewontin has included wonderful ascerbic responses to his columns and has updated the area with an epologue to each chapter that surveys recent developments.<br />The topics will interest the general reader: Recent Darwinian thinking, intelligence testing and brain metrics, the genome project, the biology of sexual equality, biology of the mind and cloning.

Ludemann divides the text into four sections: Authentic Saying of Jesus, Inauthentic Sayings of Jesus Authentic Acts of Jesus and Inauthentical Acts of Jesus. In all four sections, Ludemann shares the critical tools that shed light on the authenticity of the saying. While it is clear that there is no absolute final answer to whether a particular saying or act is authentic, Ludemann's tools are actually quite compelling and allow the reader to acquire the critical tools required to make his own assessment of a New Testament passage. For the disbeliever, this will reinforce one's belief that much of the New Testament is propaganda; for the believer it will allow the reader to see Jesus through a new perspective, free of the &quot;spin&quot; of the early Christian church. <br />Because this book teaches you some of the elementary skills of the Bible academic, I found this book to be surprisingly thought-provoking. This will enable you to read the New Testament and form your own judgment about the legitimacy of the events and sayings recorded there.<br />I suppose I have made this book sound heavy and taxing, but it is an easy read, leaving you wanted to take on Ludemanns volumns aimed at a more academic audience.<br />Well worth picking up!	2001-03-13

Thought Provoking Book	The purpose of this book is to explore the possibilities of synthesis of the various branches of study from the &quot;hard sciences&quot; to the arts. As can be imagined, this is a daunting task, but Wilson makes real progress in this book. We live in a complicated world, but Wilson makes a wonderful case for the ability of the human mind to make sense of it. He is at his best when he discusses the failure of the ideals of the Enlightenment, brain chemistry and the genetic connection to culture. He is less successful in connecting the natural sciences model to artistic expression.<br />This book is a thought-provoking read and is challenging, but these are important ideas and worth devoting time and attention to exploring them. Wilson is a man of both depth and breadth of intellect and is courageous enough to use those talents to attempt to discover the possibilities of connecting our theories of various disciplines. Sure, it's speculative, but it is also amazing the power that he brings to his argument that the various areas of human understanding can be subjected to universal principles of understanding.<br />Highly recommended!	2001-02-08

That is the reason I resisted reading it for so long. In the end, this book should be read not because it is important or still controversial after a century and a half, but because it is interesting reading, giving insight into Darwin and his times. A great deal of his examples remain compelling and his analysis still engages the intellect. This book is not dull or stuffy, but rather, fun, interesting reading. A number of the concepts with which Darwin struggles still engage biologists today. <br />This book will surprise and delight you, if you are like me, force you to read the current writings on evolution, creationism and  genetics. In a world where genetic developments rule medicine and where genetic advances challenge our ethical concepts, it is important for all of us to understand these concepts, and the best place to begin is with the man who started it, Charles Darwin.	2001-02-01

For the reader interested in the process of discovery by a scientist, I suspect that this book will satisfy. Sadly, I came to the book in a search for current information about the history of life on earth and was disappointed.  The book drifts between stories of the author's paleontological expeditions and a discussion of theories of the history of life on earth. If the reader is actually attempting to learn what Fortey knows about that history he is left to riffle through the pages in search of information. There are some interesting discussions here, but unfortunately they are buried in chatty biography. In short, if you are interested in Richard Fortey's life, buy this book. If you are interested in life on this planet, keep looking.	2001-01-30

If it's a book that you should read, then how interesting can it be? On that theory I have avoided this book for a quarter of a century. Having just completed reading Invisible Man, I was stunned by how compelling it was. Moreover, it is absolutely &quot;modern&quot; in the sense that it rings as true today as it must have nearly 50 years ago when it was written. Further, it is not a heavy handed polemic on racism; it speaks eloquently to the human condition as well as that of African-Americans. In short, read this book because it is a great read, not because it was on your literature teacher's reading list!	2001-01-25

However,I agonized over how many stars to give this book since if one is looking for a detailed account of what science can tell us about trilobites, this book will only be intermittently satifying. Fortey combines a detailed discussion about tribolite fossils and what may be deduced from those fossils with stories of his journey of discovery in learning about these fascinating creatures. He writes well in both areas, but in the end I found it frustrating to sort the information out of the travelogue.	2001-01-23

There are several wonderful recent additions to this area: Ebert's Are Souls Real? and Kaminer's Sleeping With Extra-Terrestrials are very good, but this book is the most consistently thought provoking. Shermer examines why we believe in God on a number of levels, practically, cosmologically, philosophically and logically. At every level, I found new insights. This is a book that will give you lots to think about and will send you to the bookstore to follow up on his ideas. Well worth reading twice.	2001-01-05

I have downgraded it a little because it ends with some pointless moralizing, but it is a superb introduction to the history of the soul, the history of the universe, contempory theory on the workings of the brain, discussions of free will, determinism, chaos theory and quantum physics. This book will expose the lay reader to the implications of current thinking in various disciplines as it relates to the existence of the soul or other non-material principle of causation. In short, this book is a great introduction to thinking about these issues, and reading it will send you after more reading on the subject. Highly recommended.	2000-12-23

Nobody wrote more compelling about science for the non-scientific reader. This book is a brief history of the universe as it relates to the development of mankind. It covers a lot of territory and the history of the universe is necessarily cursory. His introduction to genetics is basic, but very readable for the non-scientist. This book really begins to &quot;cook&quot; when Sagan begins to discuss the behavioral and societal charactistic of our close relatives, the primates. Read it and draw your own conclusions, but I was astounded by the parallels between human society and the behavior of the other primate species. So much of our behavior, good and bad, is exhibited in primate socialization. I notice another reviewer somehow saw this as evidence of God's creation but I think that this strains the evidence that Sagan has carefully assembled.<br />This is a book that will cause you to reassess what you believe being human means.	2000-12-19

I guess this is because scientists generally don't take it seriously and they have better things to do. This is unfortunate, since creationism is very widely believed in this country and a number of recent books by creationists have been big sellers. This book should remedy that situation, at least in part. Pennock methodically shows the problems with the creationist positions. He concentrates on logical errors in their arguments and inconsistencies in their positions. He makes a very good case against creationism. Sadly, responses to specific pieces of negative evidence (the complexity of hemoglobin, for example) are beyond the scope of this book and the curious reader will have to go elsewhere to supplement that portion of the argument. The book is careful and neutral in style, lacking the bombast of a number of the popular writers on both side of this issue. Highly recommended.	2000-12-06

Johnson, has written a number of books advocating &quot;theistic science,&quot; and has been active in the fight to get &quot;creation science&quot; taught in the schools along side or in place of evolution. This book is as good a place as any to get an introduction to the ideas and contentions of contemporary creationism. As you will see, many of the ideas are retreads of old criticisms of Darwin's ideas, and their alternative &quot;theistic science&quot; is not developed at all. If you really want a &quot;Gee Whiz!&quot; book of unanswered questions in modern evolutionary theory, see Michael Behe's book, Darwin's Black Box.	2000-12-06

In the process of reading the literature in this area, I discovered that most of the creationists books are shallow and uncompelling. Most of the arguments are retreads of old anti-Darwinian arguments. This book is the exception. Behe's arguments on molecular evolutionary theory are compelling on their face. If you are interested in this area, this book is a great place to start. However, if you are interested in the complete picture, read Gould's Wonderful Life to get naturalistic sciences response. I have taken one star off because the author alternates hokey homilies with serious science, which is absolutely maddening to read.

It is not an ideal introduction to evolutionary thought. However, this book is filled with interesting insights that make it worth the effort. While their core metaphor, the contention that evolutionary science has appropriated developments in the physical sciences, does not always work, their analysis of historical developments in science and the philosophy of science is inevitably thought provoking and worth the effort to grasp. If you are looking for a straight-forward explanation of developments in Darwinian evolutionary theory, I am sure that there are better places to start than this book. If you are looking for a thoughtful examination of how and why those developments happened the way that they did, this book will serve you quite well.	2000-12-06

Johnson's books on creationism and found some of them interesting. This book, however, is problematic. This book is intended as a book for high school students and is designed to counter biology class presentations on evolution. Sadly, it is shallow and biased, it presents incomplete and unfair arguments against evolution. It presents thoroughly discredited arguments just as if they were not fraught with problems. It saddens me to think of young minds reading this without having oppurtunity to see the complete picture. Don't get me wrong, there are intellectually honest, interesting presentations of creationism out there (Michael Behe's Darwin's Black Box, for example), this book just isn't one of them.	2000-12-06

Joseph Smith was one of the most interesting and, in the end, important Americans of the Nineteenth century.  Sadly, his followers today are offended by much of what Joseph Smith, the man, was. Fawn Brodie tells this story faithfully and well. Attacks on the author's methodology notwithstanding, this is a great and truthful biography, which gives insight into the man, his age and the American soul. It should be read open-mindedly by anyone who wishes insight into the forces that shape the American mind.	2000-11-01

The sheer bulk of material in print related to Darwin and evolution is astonishing. With the thousands of books related to this subject out there, it is a daunting task for the interested reader to know where to start. I would suggest that this book is the ideal introduction to learning about Darwin and &quot;Darwinism.&quot; The book is first and foremost a superb biography. It gives the reader a real sense of who Darwin was and what his time was like. Further, it explains the science of Darwin's era and puts the theory of natural selection into that context. It does a good job of explaining how the political, social, religious, economic and scientific context of nineteenth century Britain contributed to the development of Darwin's theory. In addition, Desmond and Moore show how Darwin's personal suffering contributed both to the development of his thinking as well as to two decades of delay in its publication. <br />The style is readable and compelling. In short, I recommend it wholeheartedly both to the casual reader with no background in the area and to those with a serious interest in the subject matter.	2000-10-15

Each chapter is freestanding, representing a recent column, with the author's updated thinking on the subject at the end of the chapter. The columns are grouped by general subject matter. In each chapter, Gardner lampoons some error in human thinking, effectively revealing the errors during the column and then moving on to another foible in the next segment. <br />This is pleasant, entertaining reading and will revive the skeptic in each reader. Fortunately for Gardner, the list of human intellectual errors is a long one, allowing Gardner the comfort of endless material from which to select for future subject matter. <br />In short, a very entertaining book.	2000-10-12

Mormons insist on &quot;faith promoting&quot; books, and proclaim that anything else is &quot;anti-Mormon.&quot; The problem is  made more difficult by the refusal of the Mormon church to make available  their historical documents to independant scholars. This book falls clearly  into the &quot;faith promoting&quot; category. It is pretty and well  written. It tells an interesting story, but forgoes any in-depth historical  analysis. It is a book designed for Mormons to give their non-Mormon  friends.<br />If you want an in depth study of the life of Joseph Smith, buy  No Man Knows My History, 2nd Edition, by Brodie or for a fascinating  psychological study, Inside the Mind of Joseph Smith by Robert D. Anderson.  If you want a neutral evaluation of the Mormon church as a whole, I  recommend Mormon America bye Richard and Joan Ostling. It you want a  propaganda coffee table book, buy this one.<br />By the way, who is the guy  who is pictured on the dustjacket?

I was delighted to see  that she has come up with fresh insights that more than justify reading the  book. Armstrong's central thesis here is that changes in the secular world  have repeatedly forced schisms within the monotheistic religions which have  then profoundly affected society as a whole. She provides many fascinating  examples out of Judaism, Islam and Christianity from numerous civilizations  over the last 2000 years. To see the ripples caused by one fundamentalist  zealot expand through civilization as a whole is astounding. Just as  interesting is to see how rapid modernization has repeatedly provoked a  fundamentalist reaction that rewrites the face of the civilization more  profoundly than the modernization itself.	2000-08-19

After the revolution he went to  France believing the French revolution to be the next step in the  development of the freedom of mankind. While there he was condemned to  death by Robespierre and detained pending execution. Believing that his  death was imminent, Paine wrote Part One of Age of Reason, which is a  compelling critique of the Bible and the faults of Christianity. His  analysis is thorough, detailed and compelling, which is particularly  impressive since he did it entirely without access to a Bible! This topic  will offend many (which explains Paine's current demise from the pantheon  of revolutionary heroes) but it should be read both for its analysis of the  Bible and for appreciation of one of America's founding fathers.	2000-08-15
