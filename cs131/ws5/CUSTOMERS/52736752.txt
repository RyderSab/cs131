Cloaked in the righteousness of war, Ms. Piven argues that extremist elements within the Republican Party skilfully exploited the public's fears in order to further a radical domestic agenda. By demonstrating that this behavior flies in the face of history -- where war has often been a catalyst for increasing democratic rights at home -- Ms. Pivens believes the political Right has opened an opportunity for the Left to successfully challenge the status quo.<br /><br />The heart of Ms. Pivens' thesis is that the apparent irrationality of the Bush administration's foreign policy and the Iraq War in particular can be partly explained by the political advantage it has gained for Republicans at home. From exorbitant no-bid contracts for reconstruction in Iraq to huge outlays for defense and homeland security to a panoply of corporate tax cuts and deregulation, the war has proven to be a boon for corporate America. On the other hand, Ms. Pivens details how a host of social programs such welfare, meal assitance, unemployment insurance, health insurance and after school programs have been quietly cut or underfunded, thereby making the lives of many ordinary Americans more difficult than before.<br /><br />Interestingly, Ms. Pivens discusses differences within the Republican Party constituency to highlight some of the contradictions created by the Bush administration's policies. For example, deregulation is a key issue for the tobacco and gun industries, but increased spending on homeland security has significantly increased the regulatory function of government. Similarly, the mostly wealthy anti-tax crowd cannot help but be alarmed by the explosive growth of the federal deficit and the threat this may pose to the long-term health of the economy. The author suggests that the rallying effect created by the September 11 attacks cannot persist in holding these factions together and that fissures within the Republican base will soon become exposed.<br /><br />Of course, at the time of her writing in mid-2004 Ms. Pivens was hopeful that the people might reject Bush's bid for reelection. However, she anticipated the possibility that the Republican political machine might unabashedly exploit the public's fear of terrorism and propagandize a handful of deeply-flawed social initiatives in order to win, a prediction that sadly proved to be true. Yet, in my sole criticism of this book, she does not articulate a Leftist or Democratic agenda that might counterpose the far-Right Republican agenda. In my opinion, the Democrats must bear responsibility for its failure to oppose the war and to articulate a credible vision for America which has created a void that the Republicans have been only too happy to fill.<br /><br />Still, I think this book does a superb job of illuminating the highly destructive course that the Bush administration and its neoconservative policies have charted for our country. I highly recommend this enlightening and empowering book to everyone.that fissures within the Republican base will soon become exposed.

US	52736752	RZPZH7J7BO74Y	0826414346	725986947	Dr. Seuss: American Icon	Books	4	3	3	N	Y	One of America's greatest creative talents	\\"Dr. Seuss: American Icon\\" by Philip Nel is a thoughtful deconstruction of the life and work of Theodore Geisel (aka Dr. Seuss). In this thoughtful book, Mr. Nel deepens our appreciation for Seuss as a distinctively American poet, artist and educator. The author demonstrates Seuss' wide ranging influence and argues for his rightful place among the most important cultural figures of the 20th century.<br /><br />An English professor at Kansas State University, Mr. Nel uses his historic knowledge to discuss how Seuss' text belongs to a tradition of great nonsense writers. Mr. Nel states that Seuss' carefully-constructed absurdist tales encourage children to challenge the status quo by gently skewering the grown-up world; elsewhere, he uses charts to show how Seuss effectively used meter and rhyme to complement his intentionally ridiculous plots and create masterful stories that have stood up well to the test of time.<br /><br />Mr. Nel recounts Seuss' early career as advertising illustrator and political cartoonist to help us better understand the influences that shaped his classic children's work. As an artist, Mr. Nel suggests that the term \\"energetic cartoon surrealism\\" appropriately describes Seuss' creative synthesis of cubism, art nouveau, surrealism and other styles. While Seuss' influence can be detected in modern rap music, children's books, political cartoons and more, Mr. Nel contends that Seuss would not have been happy about the manner in which his works have been posthumously marketed, opining that the \\"Disneyification\\" or simplification of Seuss' stories for marketable purposes \\"threatens to make 'Seuss' synomynous with the ambiguous power of global capitalism\\". Such commercialism would appear to collide with Seuss' desire to develop critical thinking among young people and to help us all imagine a better world.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for everyone interested in gaining greater insight and perspective into one of America's greatest creative talents.creative talents.	2005-09-21

The book provides an intimate look at the experiences of ordinary Cubans as they struggle to define themselves in what appears to be a country that is positioned somewhere between socialism and capitalism. In that light, the book tantalizes the reader with the possibility of Cuba's transformation into a new and unique kind of socialist or capitalist state, depending on one's own perspective.<br /><br />The authors present some of the many contradictions that abound in contemporary Cuba. For example, while articles such as \\"Four Women Survive Manzanillo\\" by Alicia Roca makes it clear that many citizens live impoverished lives, \\"Life on the Margins\\" by Julian Foley discusses how Cuban entrepreneurs are profiting from an underground economy that feeds off the officially-sanctioned tourist trade. Yet, the dollars earned by the government through tourism helps to finance popular universal educational and medical programs that benefit all of Cuba's citizens to a degree not found elsewhere in Latin America. One wonders if it will be possible for Cuba to finance its social programs through for-profit tourism without individualism and the lure of profit resulting in a breakup of the social compact.<br /><br />As in any collection, there is variability in quality. Possibly the weakest article was \\"Hip Hop Pushes the Limits\\" by Annelise Wunderlich. In my view, the author's bemoaning of the difficulties that young rap artists experience while trying to cash in on their talents tends to trivialize the debate about capitalism versus socialism. More problematically, she recognizes that Cuban rap music has gained critical and popular international acclaim but misses the point that this success is attributable to the fact that Cuban music is produced by artists living within a socialist country and therefore is viewed, rightly or wrongly, as a more authentic expression of rage against the capitalist machine compared with rap music produced elsewhere.<br /><br />Fortunately, the \\"Hip Hop\\" article is a rare moment in a book that is otherwise abundant with excellent content. The Introduction entitled, \\"Adrift: An Introduction to Contemporary Cuba\\" by Lydia Chavez provides excellent context and analysis to prepare the reader for the many articles that follow. Some of my favorites include: \\"Dancers Who Stretch the Limits\\" by Ana Campoy presents the triumphs and heartbreaks of ballet as practiced in revolutionary Cuba; \\"Socialism and the Cigar\\" by Daniela Mohor discusses the success of Cuba's socialist cigar factories in producing world-renowned products while providing benefits to its workers; \\"Authors Who Knew or Know the Limits\\" by Ezequiel Minaya draws on interviews with prominent writers who have struggled with Cuba's sometimes Stalinist repression of free expression; \\"Cubans Log on Behind Castro's Back\\" by John Cote describes how Cubans gain access to the Internet in a country with limited technological resources and government controls; and \\"The Spanish are Back\\" by Megan Lardner discusses the volatile but increasingly necessary relationship between Spain and Cuba, with an emphasis on the effect Spanish investment is having on reviving the Cuban economy.<br /><br />I highly recommend this intriguing book for anyone interested in contemplating the question of whether the contemporary Cuban experience represents a glass that is half full or half empty -- and whether that glass might ultimately prove to be socialist or capitalist.gainst the capitalist machine compared with rap music produced elsewhere.

Bush and His Corporate Pals Are Plundering the Country and Hijacking Our Democracy	Books	4	9	11	N	Y	The sordid deeds of the Bush administration	\\"Crimes Against Nature\\" by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. tells an important story that is painfully familiar to most environmental activists but largely unknown to most consumers of corporate media reporting: namely, that crony capitalism has enveloped our government in greed and sold our nation's collective natural resources to the highest bidder. That a person of Mr. Kennedy's stature has the courage to articulate this argument is a welcome development and an important contribution to helping mobilize a response to the crisis.<br /><br />While it should be self-evident that the Bush administration's virulent form of cronyism is inherently bad for people, the environment and our democracy, it also provides ample opportunity for Mr. Kennedy to sharply criticize the perpetrators of these crimes. Many of the outrageous actions and policies promulgated over the first three years of the Bush presidency are recalled, including the early reversal of a campaign pledge on power plant emissions, the mercury standards debacle, the betrayal of EPA administrator Christine Todd Whitman, the purging of agency administrators, the tax breaks showered onto polluting industries, among many other deplorable actions. In my view, Mr. Kennedy's tone is appropriately strident in the manner in which he describes how the administration has calluously swept aside commonsense, science and democracy in order to shower favors on the privileged few.<br /><br />No doubt this book can serve as an eye-opening primer for most conservative or apathetic political readers about corporate crime, government and the environment. One hopes that the book can find a home on library and school shelves to instruct current and future generations of readers about the sordid deeds of the Bush administration, whose behavior will undoubtedly be recalled as one of the worst chapters in U.S. history.	2005-08-28

Wright, \\"Domain Errors! Cyberfeminist Practices\\" is a provocative collection of essays, poems and art works that thoughtfully analyzes technology's impact on women and suggests possibilities for radical change. The book is a project of subRosa, an organization that is dedicated to articulating a sophisticated cyberfeminist critique of society.<br /><br />The book is divided into three sections.<br /><br />\\"Racism and Cyberfeminism in the Integrated Circuit\\" contains seven articles that pertain to the social relations of the Internet. Maria Fernandez and Faith Wilding contend that cyberfeminists must challenge and subvert power in order to privilege people over centrally-controlled systems of technological production. Maria Fernandez demonstrates how racism persists in online culture and highlights the necessity of addressing the problem in the offline world. Michelle M. Wright connects Hegelian thought with mainstream culture's tendency to minimize the contributions of minorities to our intellectual heritage. Other thoughtful essays in this section include Lisa Nakamura's insightful discussion of the racial dynamics displayed in the movie \\"The Matrix\\"; Irina Aristarkhova's personal account of Russian imperialism and the concept of otherliness; Susanna Paasonen's critique of corporate websites and their false representations of female empowerment; and Rhadika Gajjala and Annapurna Mamidipudi's musings on how women from the global South might gain real power (and not be coopted) by joining online communities.<br /><br />\\"The Female Flesh Commodities Lab\\" contains eleven pieces that examines biotechnology and other related sciences of the body. Lucia Sommer ponders how to represent reality within the context of an increasingly commodified culture that is seduced by biotechnology. subRosa's article on assitive reproductive technologies (ART) critiques the industry's profiteering from the biological control of women's bodies. Faith Wilding discusses the problematic relationship of medicine with women's sexuality and compares ancient genital mutilation with modern plastic surgery. Emily de Araujo and Lucia Sommer provide a brief history of eugenics in the U.S. and connects it with the growth of today's biotechnology industry. Other articles include Lucia Sommer's Marxist-inspired analysis of globalized capital's ongoing exploitation of age, race, gender and class; Pattie Bell Hasting's clever piece comparing mothering functions with computerese; subRosa's guide to conducting a college-level workshop that critiques art, biotechnology and eugenics; Amelia Jones' highly personal chronicle of her mental and emotional struggles with infertility treatments; Christina Hung's lessons on female empowerment achieved through alternative healing; Tania Kupczak's exploration of how ART has created new opportunities for gay and lesbian households to form families; and a short poem by Lucia Sommer.<br /><br />\\"Research! Action! Embodiment! Conviviality!\\" contains eight articles that provide examples of how women might challenge the status quo and take action to create a more liveable world. Terri Kapsalis suggests that the designer doll industry may be preparing a new generation of girls for the marketing of designer babies as adults and imagines ways to contest the false promise of attaining predisposed personality traits through genetic engineering. Other articles indlude Irina Aristarkhova's chronicles of the struggle to create a distinctly feminist art in Singapore; Nell Tenhaaf's discussion of interactive art; Maria Fernandez' insightful interview with an alternative healing practicioner; Hyla Willis' ad-jam of the ART industry; a rant by Faith Wilding; an impressive history of subRosa's education and activism efforts from its founding in 1998 to 2003; and subRosa's manifesto for creating social spaces that are conducive to interdependent thought and action.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to everyone.	2005-08-21

Skillfully weaving anecdotes and profiles of key plaintiffs and their claims of sexism with research about Wal-Mart and its Orwellian corporate culture, the book provides an excellent critique of the company's numerous illegal behaviors and a humane narrative of its female employees' struggle for justice.<br /><br />Interestingly, Ms. Featherstone's analysis suggests that the company's paradigmatic success is attributable to its parasitical relationship with the declining fortunes of the working class. Wal-Mart cynically promotes itself as a pro-family, pro-American company even as it offers poverty-level wages and imports most of its wares from foreign, low-wage countries. In this manner, Ms. Featherstone explains that Wal-Mart both contributes to and profits from the exploitation of marginalized female laborers.<br /><br />Ms. Featherstone is careful to discuss the limitations of the lawsuit as a tool to effect systemic change at Wal-Mart. She contends that it is probably equally important for the public to become educated about the inequities at Wal-Mart in order to create a media firestorm that might pressure the company to change its ways. However, Ms. Featherstone describes the difficulties that unions and interest groups have had trying to organize labor and shoppers in the struggle with Wal-Mart, contending that our consumer culture tends to set aside worker's rights issues in favor of shopping expediency. Nevertheless, as the lawsuit moves forward the author is hopeful that Wal-Mart may soon feel the need to make significant changes in order to avert a court-imposed solution and/or a public relations catastrophe.<br /><br />I highly recommend this outstanding book to everyone.	2005-07-20

Arranged in chronological order and spanning over five decades, the essays provide an unique perspective on Mr. Chomsky's intellectual development into one of today's most influential and prominent critics of capitalism. The book demonstrates that anarchist theory has significantly influenced Mr. Chomsky's thought, revealing a side of Mr. Chomsky that is often implied but infrequently made explicit in his writings.<br /><br />Among the eleven works, I found \\"Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship\\" (1969) to be a particularly appealing critique and discussion of the Vietnam War and the anarchist society that emerged briefly in Spain during its Civil War in the 1930s. Here, Mr. Chomsky displays at a relatively early point in his career the qualities for which he would become famous; his biting satire and devastating deconstruction of the powerful, in this case directed at the false justifications for the war in Vietnam and the West's non-support for Spanish democracy, provides many thought-provoking and timeless truisms.<br /><br />\\"Containing the Threat of Democracy\\" (1990) is another noteworthy piece in that it exemplifies a mature writer who has a masterful command of history, social theory and criticism. Mr. Chomsky brilliantly draws on Enlightenment thought to critique how the powerful have used the force of law to enable the rule of the few over the many, with a wide-ranging discussion of how Western elitism has resulted in genocide, war and repression under the guise of civilization. We learn how the business class has allied with the government to use propaganda to serve their mutual interests and mold public opinion, thereby allowing poverty and violence to persist and preventing a more meaningful form of democracy to emerge.<br /><br />Mr. Chomsky directly addresses anarchism in response to questions from several interviewers. Citing Daniel Guerin as a major influence, Mr. Chomsky explains that anarchism requires structure at the local, national and international levels but is characterized by its lack of a central authority. Mr. Chomsky believes that developing a successful anarchist society will require time and experimentation; he also contends that state intervention will be necessary to ensure a successful transition from capitalist rule to absolute democracy. Ultimately, Mr. Chomsky makes a strong argument that humanity will gain mightily from solving the problem of authoritarian oppression and applying its collective wisdom to the positive task of building an anarchist society grounded in the principles of peace, freedom and equality for all.uence, Mr. Chomsky explains that anarchism requires structure at the local, national and international levels but is characterized by its lack of a central authority.

This engaging book intelligently discusses the painting's substantive role in 20th Century America's struggle for cultural identity. The author's cogent, well-researched and accessible writing has produced a book that should interest a wide audience, including historians, artists, pop culture afficianados and general readers.<br /><br />Mr. Biel profiles the artist's problematic personal life and his transformation from expatriate bohemian to earnest painter of American regionalism to illuminate some of the ambiguities that have been transposed into \\"American Gothic\\". For example, might the cathedral-like architecture and the model's buttoned-up attire represent the artist's own religious guilt and repressed sexuality or is it merely a recording of small-town Puritanical morality? Do the age differences between the male and female figures suggest a father/daughter or husband/wife relationship, with the varying meanings entailed by such a reading, and what does it say about the artist's adult relationship with his mother? According to Mr. Biel, these are a few of the painting's enigmatic qualities that serve to fascinate new generations of viewers.<br /><br />Painted in 1930, we learn that \\"American Gothic\\" was initially greeted with praise from the artistic vanguard who appreciated its Menckenesque critique of the culturally backward Midwest. However, as the Depression wore on, Mr. Biel writes that the steely determination of the subjects appealed to a mass audience that was in search of stability and reassurance in a time of crisis. As a result, the image was pressed into service by the corporate mass media as a propagandistic representation of American values. Not surprisingly, the painting fell out of favor with the Left. The work was savagely critiqued for its idealized depiction of Jeffersonian agrarianism, including its omission of any hint of massive popular discontent with capitalism and its subtle suggestion of isolationism and fanatacism.<br /><br />Mr. Biel draws on his knowledge of film, literature, theater, and popculture history to tell us that postwar society tended to parody \\"American Gothic\\" as a means to compare and contrast changing lifestyles and attitudes with the idea of a mythic, uncorrupted America. In the early 1960s, the painting was successfully used to sell cereal to consumers; in the late 1960s and 1970s, numerous parodies poked fun at changing sexual mores, the war on drugs and other topics. Exploitation of the image has continued to the present, including a noteworthy collage that makes a strong and biting comment on the war on terror. The author contends that the ubiquitousness of the parodies has served to solidify the painting's iconolatry as the normalized definition of the nation's so-called \\"heartland\\", which is commonly understood to mean white, middle-class rural America.<br /><br />The book includes a middle section with full-color reproductions of the original painting and a selection of some of the more interesting parodies. Numerous black and white illustrations are also interspersed throughout the text. These pictures help readers follow Mr. Biel's narrative and analysis with ease.<br /><br />I highly recommend this entertaining and thoughtful book to everyone.n of Jeffersonian agrarianism, including its omission of any hint of massive popular discontent with capitalism and its subtle suggestion of isolationism and fanatacism.

This fascinating book should appeal to academics, feminists, labor activists and others who may be interested in learning about the dynamic processes by which globalization exploits gender for profit. Importantly, Ms. Salzinger's keen insight and analysis helps open the door to imagining a world where gender stereotypes could be transcended and labor rights accorded more respect.<br /><br />Ms. Salzinger's meticulous ethnographic work at four maquila factories helps her obtain an insider's view of how sexual identities struggle for recognition and reward on the shop floor. The author discusses how the \\"trope of feminity\\" deludes investors into locating factories in places where it is believed that female laborers will passively accept routinized work for low wages. However, as the facts on the ground depart from this fantasy, the struggle between capital and labor is observed to be gendered but nonetheless highly variable and contextual.<br /><br />Ms. Salzinger dedicates one chapter apiece to her experiences at four manufacturing plants in northern Mexico. She cleverly assigns pseudonyms to describe the salient characteristics of each plant. For example, \\"Andromex\\" is a factory where male and female workers become almost androgenous through the development of similar work habits; \\"Anarchomex\\" is noteworthy for its embattled masculine workers conflicting both amongst themselves and with female co-workers to create nearly anarchic conditions of production; and so on. The writing in these chapters is vivid, engaging and intelligent, imparting glimpses into both the worker's daily struggle for survival and the logic of the managerial systems that controls and exploits these workers.<br /><br />I found it interesting (if not disheartening) to learn that capital's strategy of dividing the working class by gender has proven to be remarkably effective. By redefining production as primarily women's work, employers can pay below-subsistance wages and offer scant benefits, job enrichment or advancement opportunities. As made clear through Ms. Salzinger's field research, these diminished career expectations deprive the working class of Mexico with the hope of achieving a better life and are frequently used as a threat to drive down wages in the U.S. and other industrialized nations.<br /><br />In the final chapter, Ms. Salzinger draws on feminist writings to connect the trope of feminity with cultural norms that tend to devalue women through their association with domesticity. By discovering that gendered meanings in the workplace can be flexible, however, the author suggests that subjectivity may be contestable. If structures of power are a \\"concatenation of common-sense understandings\\" about women's perceived role in the home, she argues, then the reality of changed meanings forged in the crucible of workplace production may point the way in time to new, empowered definitions.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to demanding readers who may be interested in an original and thought-provoking thesis about gender and globalization.on as primarily women's work, employers can pay below-subsistance wages and offer scant benefits, job enrichment or advancement opportunities.

In an engaging and accessible writing style, Ms. Smith analyzes the class basis of women's oppression and discusses how building a socialist society is critical to achieving equality between the sexes. The book is refreshing in its ability to wade through the current feminist intellectual impasse and presents a clear-cut vision of how to achieve meaningful change for men and women everywhere.<br /><br />Ms. Smith centers her analysis in Frederick Engels' groundbreaking work on historical materialism. Engels understood that the burden of domestic production falls on women and provides capital with a cheap means of reproducing labor power and allowing men to dominate the production and distribution of surplus value and culture. This relegates women to a subordinate status within the nuclear family and is often characterized by sexual exploitation. But through socialism, women can achieve equality by lifting the burden of privatized production.<br /><br />In fact, the positive example provided by Russia's experience in the early years of the 1917 revolution supports the theory that socialism can measurably improve women's lives. Ms. Smith provides evidence of how Lenin and others in the revolutionary government specifically sought to empower women through unprecedented legislation that was in accordance with Marx and Engels' theories; unfortunately, these substantial gains were lost when Stalin rolled back these particular laws during the counterrevolution.<br /><br />After reminding us that many of Russia's bourgeois feminists supported Stalin's reimposition of classism, Ms. Smith goes on to critique the contemporary feminist movement as exemplified by Naomi Wolf, NOW and others for its elitism and predisposition to accomodating the needs of capital which have practically ground the movement down to irrelevance. Ms. Smith points out that the individual achievements of exceptional persons such as Hillary Clinton does little for working class households who are suffering from steadily declining wages and deteriorating public services. Ms. Smith helps to reenergize the debate by demanding an uncompromising brand of socialism that can help improve the lives of all women, including universal health care, child care, and abortion rights for all.<br /><br />Ms. Smith exposes the extreme hypocrisy of the Religious Right and the Conservative movement's promotion of war as a solution to the plight of Islamic women. She asserts that religious ideology serves the interests of class society and she finds little difference between the church and the mosque in their repressive treatment of women. In fact, the Religious Right's agenda is principally political and its agenda is inherently hostile to women, as evidenced by the Bush administration's myriad assaults on abortion rights and public services.<br /><br />I highly recommend this timely, original and insightful book to everyone.ceptional persons such as Hillary Clinton does little for working class households who are suffering from steadily declining wages and deteriorating public services.

The book focuses on the strategic importance of Colombia's mining and energy sectors to explain how powerful interests have conspired to wreak havoc on the lives of workers and the environment.<br /><br />In the Introduction, Aviva Chomsky contends that intervention by the U.S. into Colombia's affairs is driven by the need to secure corporate profits by preserving social inequality. We learn how Colombia's corrupt ruling class has partnered with major transnational corporations to exploit its labor and resources largely for the benefit of the few.<br /><br />The Prologue by Javier Giraldo is a passionate indictment of the violence inflicted upon Colombian human rights and labor activists by the Colombian military and private paramilitaries. Mr. Giraldo paints a damning portrait of an entire nation that appears to have lost its moral compass through its wholesale servitude to the interests of capital.<br /><br />Mr. Cuellar's description of how native peoples have been dispossessed of their lands is reminiscent of the movie \\"The Rundown\\". Multinational corporations have been granted privileges by the Colombian state within specially-designated economic zones where civil liberties have been suspended and rule is enforced by paramilitary force. Through such arrangements, international investors and corporations such as Conquistador Mines, Exxon-Mobil and Harken Energy have been allowed to extract Colombia's wealth at criminally low tax rates.<br /><br />Mr. Cuellar urgently requests support from the international community to help end the violence in his country. The author notes that U.S. military aid has been mainly directed to the mining and energy economic zones, suggesting that the so-called Drug War is in actuality a front for the repression of human rights. As the President of Sintraminercol, a union representing workers in Colombia's mining industry, Mr. Cuellar provides many pages of footnotes, documentation and statistics to help support his claims and lends credibility to the story.ry, Mr. Cuellar provides many pages of footnotes, documentation and statistics to help support his claims and lends credibility to the story.	2005-05-30

The multiple perspectives help readers understand the depth and sophistication of ecofeminist theory while learning how positive change can occur in the real world. The book should serve as an excellent resource and provide inspiration for students, activists and general interest readers.<br /><br />The first section discusses globalization, gender and the environment. Mary Mellor explains that men and women typically experience differential relationships with the environment, where women tend to be most disadvantaged by environmental destruction. Heather Eaton stresses the strategic importance of challenging the capitalist system for the ecofeminist movement to remain relevant.<br /><br />The second section presents case studies from around the world. In Kenya, Celia Nyamweru shows that the preservation of the sacred Kaya forests is largely men's (not women's) work, suggesting that gender roles are culturally and not biologically determined. Lois Ann Lorentzen perceives the struggle for nature and community in Chiapas, Mexico as an event that inherently concerns ecofeminists as an instance of grass-roots democratization and empowerment. Aruna Gnanadason's exceptional article about India traces the plunder of resources in her country to colonialism and systems of domination by gender, class and race; she goes on to argue that the \\"cultural traditions of prudent exploitation of natural resources\\" that had existed for centuries are necessary to restore a steady-state economy that puts people and environment before profits.<br /><br />The third section addresses the myriad ecofeminist responses to globalization. Noel Sturgeon recalls the tendency in the 1970s to blame poor women for the environmental crisis and urges all women today to \\"act together against power\\". Wan-Li Ho discusses the significant legislative victories that Taiwanese nuns and monks have achieved on behalf of animal and human rights. Mary Judith Ress critiques the Christian theme of \\"divine child abuse\\" in the crucifixion narrative and shares the Con-Spirando Collective's goal of developing a more compassionate and inclusive spirituality in South America. Ivone Gebara compares the historic male control of morality and the Catholic Church with western society's often immoral oppression of nature and women. Masatsugu Maruyama discusses the role of gender in Japanese spiritualism and speculates on how female empowerment might reshape Japanese culture. Finally, Greta Gaard discusses ecofeminism's contribution to the Green Party and credits the Youth Green movement with having the courage to challenge the myth of biological determinism in order to transcend traditional gender roles.<br /><br />In my view, the thought-provoking articles in \\"Ecofeminism & Globalization\\" point the way towards an ethic that might help transform our world for the better.

In these coherent and passionate presentations, Mr. Castro distinguishes himself as possibly the most important, if not most misunderstood, critic of globalization and an articulate spokesperson for the invisible poor of the Third World. Indeed, Mr. Castro's unique life experiences and demonstrated ability to persuasively speak truth to power definitively distinguishes him from all other current world leaders.<br /><br />The opening chapter is an interview with Mr. Castro in which he condemns the U.S. political system as undemocratic inasmuch as it is controlled by mega corporations, who have imposed \\"apartheid throughout the world\\" through the imposition of an unjust economic order. Mr. Castro goes on to credit the Cuban people for their durability in surviving the illegal U.S. economic embargo and the collapse of the Soviet Union, and asks for the forgiveness of debt on behalf of the poor nations of the world. Throughout the interview, Mr. Castro reveals myriad aspects of his personality, including intellectualism, humanitarianism, self-confidence and humor.<br /><br />The following 14 speeches are delivered on a range of topics delivered at major cities including the United Nations, Harlem, Caracas, Panama City, Quebec, South Africa and of course, Havana. Reading the content of these speeches, one is impressed with Mr. Castro's ability to deliver relevant content that could not have failed to resonate with their diverse audiences. While Mr. Castro often supports his statements with thorough research and consistently presents a well-reasoned, cogent argument, the urgency of his still-revolutionary message fairly leaps off the page.<br /><br />One of the key themes articulated by Mr. Castro is the problem of capitalist consumer culture and the unequal distribution of resources which in turn is leading the world inexorably towards environmental, social and economic disaster. Mr. Castro astutely connects the historic abuse and slavery of indigenous peoples and imperialism with the impoverishment of the citizens of the Third World today. Cuba's embrace of socialism and its successes with respect to education, health care and democracy are compared favorably with the fate of many others who have been suffering from the ill effects of globalization, including the poor of the industrialized nations and a growing class of impoverished people living within the U.S. and Europe. In my view, it is ironic that Mr. Castro's message contains many truths about what may need to be done to create a sustainable and just world economy that would help guarantee prosperity for all, although it is often the case that opinion leaders in the wealthy nations attempt to discredit him and his ideas.<br /><br />For example, the final two speeches on the U.S. war on terrorism are noteworthy for their insight into current events and how all nations might collectively work together to resolve difficult issues. Delivered mere weeks after the attacks of September 11, 2001 Mr. Castro's keen political observations have proven to be prescient, including the attribution of fanaticism to both the Islamic fundamentalists and U.S. leadership, as well as his prediction that George W. Bush would probably use the crisis to further an extreme right-wing political agenda. However, Mr. Castro displays considerable statesmanship by opposing both terrorism and war, saying that \\"thinking and conscience can be stronger than terror and death\\" and calling for peace and international cooperation to help resolve differences between nations.<br /><br />I encourage everyone to read this remarkably thought-provoking and inspiring book written by one of the most important voices of our time.he world inexorably towards environmental, social and economic disaster.

This highly-readable work skillfully examines the subject of toxics pollution and the petrochemical industry's tendency to disproportionately harm people of color. In particular, the book is noteworthy for the care and compassion with which Mr. Lerner has profiled and documented the remarkable individuals who successfully led a grassroots campaign for justice in Diamond, Louisiana. In so doing, the author has alerted us to the potential for the environmental and racial justice movements to collaborate and work for change.<br /><br />The first section recounts the unique history of Diamond. The tight-knit African-American community had endured centuries of slavery and segregation only to find itself on a collision course with Big Oil due to Diamond's location near the Gulf of Mexico. Over many years, the massive amounts of pollution released by Shell's refineries and chemical plants located adjacent to Diamond had caused ill health among the local population and spurred the citizens into organized action.<br /><br />The second section discusses Shell and its relations with its neighbors. Through numerous interviews and visits to Diamond and the adjacent community of Norco, Mr. Lerner uncovered a startling difference in how the two ethnically stratified towns perceived reality. The mostly white residents of Norco, many of whom were employed by Shell, seemed unwilling to acknowledge the ill effects of the pollution and openly questioned the motivations of the black residents of Diamond, most of whom did not benefit economically from the plant and consequently did not shrink from vocalizing their discontent. In my view, the author's mature treatment of this particular aspect of the story provides insight into the deep-rooted racial divide in America and helps us understand how we might heal the relationship.<br /><br />The third and fourth sections document the increasing tension as hard evidence of toxic releases exposed Shell's non-compliance with EPA regulations and elevated the level of distrust in the community. Greenpeace and other organizations joined with the local residents in highlighting the injustice and brought increased media scrutiny on the situation.<br /><br />The fifth section shows how victory was achieved through the linking of the struggle in Diamond with the well-known case of the Ogoni people and their victimization by Shell's operations in Nigeria. The threat of negative publicity prior to a prominent international conference proved to be decisive, moving Shell management to strike a deal with Diamond residents.<br /><br />In the final section, Mr. Lerner discusses the lessons learned. The author recommends buffer zones around plants, better monitoring of air and the phase-out of toxic chemicals.<br /><br />In the Conclusion, Mr. Lerner credits Shell with doing the right thing but discusses the human costs of relocating the residents, a strategy that took people out of harm's way but divided neighbors who had lived near one another for generations. But in winning this David-versus-Goliath struggle, the author praises Diamond resident Margie Richards for her faith, intelligence and perseverance in leading the struggle to fruition. Ms. Richards is compared with Rosa Parks as a role model and an inspiration to all who are struggling for environmental justice.<br /><br />I highly recommend this pathbreaking and important book to everyone.increasing tension as hard evidence of toxic releases exposed Shell's non-compliance with EPA regulations and elevated the level of distrust in the community.

Using thorough documentation and skillful analysis, Ms. Beder contends that today's pathological obsession with work is a direct result of the capitalist production of human subjectivity. The author argues that a change in priorities from production and consumption to one that privileges the quality of life and the environment is needed to resuscitate our frayed society.<br /><br />Section One discusses the Reformation and the transition from precapitalism to the present. Ms. Beder contrasts the anti-materialist teachings from ancient Greece and the early Christian church with the Protestants who gave a voice to the emerging capitalist class by equating prosperity with virtue. As time progressed, business-sponsored schools, churches and newspapers promoted the work ethic and coerced labor to accept the discipline of the factory. The effectiveness of this mass propaganda is attested to the fact that despite declining real wages and growing inequality, the myth of the American Dream persists to the present day.<br /><br />Section Two is on the topic of motivating work. Ms. Beder begins with Taylor and Ford to show how industrialists experimented with various methods for controlling and exploiting the workforce. But as welfare capitalism subsequently sought to create emotional and familial bonds with employees and curb union militancy, the downsizing and job insecurity of the postmodern era has shattered the employment contract. Hence the recent restructuring of government welfare programs has been necessitated to punish the poor into accepting menial jobs that otherwise might go unfilled.<br /><br />Section Three is about conditioning. The education system molds students for production through overwork and instills the ethos of competition by organizing team sports. Mass marketing leads to increased consumption of the commodities that signify status in a society of mass anonymity. Unfortunately, the stress of working long hours to achieve material success manifests itself in a myriad of social maladies including anxiety, obesity and rampant drug abuse.<br /><br />Ms. Beder concludes that the work ethic crowds out time for people to reflect on the deeper meaning of their lives and to work collectively towards change. While the author offers little guidance as to how people might move beyond this impasse, those who do take the time to read her book are rewarded with greater insight and understanding. In this respect, then, \\"Selling the Work Ethic\\" may help readers begin to deconstruct and challenge the status quo.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to everyone.ies that signify status in a society of mass anonymity.

The penetrating analyses offered by the sixteen outstanding writers in this collection makes a powerful statement about the Socialist movement's continued relevance in our increasingly fractured world.<br /><br />The first two articles describe how globalization has been constructed through U.S. imperialism. Varda Burstyn's article draws inspiration from the works of several great Socialist writers from the past to find their ideas operative in the present. Burstyn connects President George W. Bush's shifting political alliances and doublespeak with the work of George Orwell; similarly, Burstyn finds that the bioscience and pharmaceutical industry's work towards engineering and pacifying the privileged classes had previously been imagined by Aldous Huxley. Stephen Gill explains how U.S. military and political power has been used to control international trade but believes that deficits resulting from imperial overstretch and growing negative public opinion might signal a turning point against the U.S.<br /><br />Two works focus on the U.S.' domination of the post-World War II financial system. Interestingly, both Panitch and Gindin's and Christopher Rude's articles find that crisis has served as an integral component in the financial system's ability to discipline both labor and recalcitrant governments. Contrasting the institutional protections that have been built for financiers with the insecurities of the working class, the authors believe that increasing inequality and political illegitimacy may open the door for popular anti-capitalist movements to emerge.<br /><br />Several articles explored the relationship between the media and ideology. Scott Forsyth suggests that the Hollywood action film's promotion of the U.S. engaging in a 'good war' is becoming an increasingly difficult idea to sell to the rest of the world. Yuezhi Zhao traces the Chinese State's embrace of corporate news and entertainment to the class alliance between transnational capitalists and China's ruling elite, which in turn has led to a culture of consumption that has left vast numbers of Chinese citizens impoverished.<br /><br />Three articles addressed the topic of development. Harriet Friedmann highlights the myriad shortcomings of the industrial agriculture system and makes a case for indigenous rights and self-determination. Vivek Chibber's history of developmentalism shows how capital used the state to first repress labor and then take control of the state itself, whereupon subsequent development has benefited mostly private interests at the expense of the public. Gerald Greenfield discusses how nationalism has been exploited by leaders in the global South to restructure their states to meet capitalist requirements, suggesting a need to confront both class and capital and not merely U.S. imperial ambitions.<br /><br />A collection of very interesting articles about the European Union (EU) challenges the idea that the EU might provide a more attractive alternative to U.S. leadership. John Grohl writes a history of the EU that stresses its economic and political domination by the U.S. and the subsequent nurturing of a pro-corporate legal system, the repression of labor, and a decline in the quality of life for many people. Dorothee Bohle points to the EU's exploitation of Eastern Europe as evidence that the EU is keen to implement an extreme neoliberal agenda and, in the case of Yugoslavia, is incapable of political leadership in the absence of U.S. military power. Frank Deppe critiques Jurgen Habermas' manifesto for an EU that embraces U.S.-style neoliberalism while wishing itself independent from the U.S., arguing that Socialism remains the best hope for distinguishing the EU if it hopes to lead the world towards a sustainable and just future.<br /><br />Other articles discuss South Africa, Columbia, Russia, and Latin America. In each case, the authors stress the critical role the state plays in promoting corporate interests at the expense of people and the environment. Yet struggles for justice persist, suggesting that public discontent can develop into a broad-based movement that can successfully challenge capitalism.<br /><br />As the legendary Tony Benn states in a profound interview in the concluding chapter: \\"...you can't hold people down, and that has been the lesson of history\\".bia, Russia, and Latin America.

The authors present a new historiography of Santa Clara County, California that reveals a pattern of exploitation of people and resources dating from the Spanish Colonial period to the present. The book makes a compelling case that sustainability will remain elusive as long as for-profit capitalism rules the day.<br /><br />Pellow and Park study the area's historical development to find common threads between the past and the present. Each economic period was marked by the despoilation and depletion of California's natural resources, and in all cases, the production system was characterized by the exploitation of predominantly poor, immigrant and female labor.<br /><br />Interestingly, the authors show how the powerful have been consistently supported by their government sponsors even as the rights of the poor have been systematically denied. We find that the Spanish government's funding of the missionaries was not substantially different from the U.S. government's support of the California gold mining industry of the 1800s, the canneries of the early to mid twentieth century or the highly lucrative defense industry of today. Yet the indigenuous peoples and the poor immigrant workers who have labored in the fields and the factories have been consistently denied their political and economic rights. In this light, the fact that the poor suffer disproportionately from environmental injustices should not be surprising, or that the struggle to overcome the powerful interests that profit from the system remains difficult.<br /><br />The authors show how the electronics manufacturing that dominates Silicon Valley today is not the \\"clean\\" industry that is often promoted by corporate public relations firms. We learn how the so-called \\"immaterial\\" economy is in fact produced with enormous amounts of energy inputs and demanding physical labor. Management's criminal silence on issues pertaining to workplace safety and the pollution of the local environment clashes severely with the industry's oft-repeated hyperbole about the open and empowered society that is purportedly fostered through information technology.<br /><br />The author's analysis is supported with moving testimonies from flesh-and-blood workers who have suffered the ill effects of toxic exposure. Their heart-wrenching stories bring home the human costs of our high-tech culture in a deeply compelling way. But the authors also relate how grass-roots organizations have won modest victories in their attempts to protect workers and the community from harm. Clearly, the empowerment of women and minorities and respect for the environment is critical to achieving a sustainable and egalitarian society.<br /><br />I recommend this highly readable, insightful and important book to everyone.l\\" economy is in fact produced with enormous amounts of energy inputs and demanding physical labor.

Even as his work seeks to transform and undo some of the central concepts of Marx's corpus, Professor Read shows how the struggle between capital and labor assumes new forms as postmodern society becomes increasingly subsumed by capitalism. The author succeeds brilliantly in showing how Marx's problematic of class struggle is continually produced anew and points to the possibility of a new radical politics that accounts for our own unique place and time in history.<br /><br />Professor Read explains that the primitive accumulation of early capitalism extinguished feudalism and gave rise to the state, laws, and the nuclear family. This violent struggle continues into the present as capital colonizes the genetic code, for example, in a never-ending and evolutionary process that subsumes all material objects to its own ends. Similarly, the author demonstrates that as capital accumulates, subjectivity accumulates -- meaning, among other things, that humanity's immersion in the logic of the capitalist mode of production intensifies and its collective memory of a pre-capitalist history dissolves.<br /><br />As a consequence of this evolution, Professor Read argues that the \\"formal subsumption\\" of the factory model described by Marx has yielded to the \\"real subsumption\\" of postmodern society. Simply put, the locus of production (and conflict) has changed from the factory floor to society, culture, and life itself. In an argument that bears similarity to Antonio Negri's thesis in the book [[ASIN:0674006712 Empire]], Professor Read shows how the production of \\"knowledge, desire and communication\\" has moved to the strategic center of capitalist production, suggesting that it is here that the struggle for liberation from capitalism might ensue.<br /><br />Thoroughly researched and persuasively argued, Professor Read's book is recommended for demanding readers who are interested in an original, thought-provoking and scholarly analysis of Marx and the relevance of his theories in today's world. Highly recommended.ommended for demanding readers who are interested in an original, thought-provoking and scholarly analysis of Marx and the relevance of his theories in today's world.

Like a socialist-minded Alexis de Tocqueville, Mr. Amin's internationalist perspective allows him to peer into American society in order to dissect it clearly, intelligently and persuasively. The result is a penetrating analysis that helps us understand how the U.S. has become the violent purveyor of an \\"obscolescent\\" form of capitalism that humanity must resist or else risk its continued descent into barbarism.<br /><br />Mr. Amin begins by debunking the liberal vision of U.S. economic and cultural triumphalism as mere ideology and media propaganda, arguing that America's privileged position is due mainly to the exercise of political power backed by military force. Drawing on Marx, the author presents an alternative view that stresses class conflict and the role of the state, which uses its power to enforce the accumulation of wealth for the benefit of American capital. With the European Union and Japan as junior partners in this project, Mr. Amin states that \\"apartheid on a world scale\\" has ensued for the people living in the global South who realize little benefit from this system.<br /><br />In tracing the origins of liberalism, Mr. Amir connects the history of America's settlement by extremist religious sects and the practice of genocide and slavery to explain how Americans have tended to mix racism, violence and selfish individualism with capitalism in an uniquely barbaric form. Interestingly, the author turns the tables on the myth of \\"New America\\" and \\"Old Europe\\", positing that the American presidential system precludes the diversity of opinion found in European parliamentary politics, thus stifling debate and making it easier for neoliberal (conservative) ideologues to prevail. Today, the admixture of fanatic religiosity and military strength presents a frightening image to the world of a U.S. that is controlled by \\"neo-Nazis\\" dedicated to preserving America's privileged economic position at all costs.<br /><br />In the final chapter, Mr. Amin proposes strategies for how the world might restructure to go beyond capitalism and resist U.S. domination. The author believes that Europe must provide leadership by establishing its own alliances in a way that creates solidarity with the South and allows progressive and humanist values to flourish. If technology can be pressed into the service of human needs and not profit, the author hopes that a new \\"people's internationalism\\" can emerge to bring about an era of peace, prosperity and equality for all.<br /><br />In the end, \\"The Liberal Virus\\" helps us understand many uncomfortable truths and the changes that need to be made if we wish our country to become a positive force in the world.

The book paints a frightening picture of the unprecedented and virtually unchecked powers that are currently at the disposal of U.S. policy makers.<br /><br />Mr. Wirbel details numerous government-funded space technology programs while discussing the national security objectives and philosophies that guided their creation. We find a desire to achieve military domination evident at the start of the Cold War but realized only recently with the demise of deterrence in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks. The author painstakingly lays out a detailed chronology of how technological innovations have advanced in lock-step with increasingly bold and assertive U.S. foreign policies over the past forty years. In that light, the emergence of George W. Bush's unabashedly unilateralist administration is but an explicit expression of a U.S.-controlled world order that has existed well before the collapse of the Soviet Union.<br /><br />Among the book's many attributes is the debunking of Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) as a purely defensive program. The reader learns how the reality differs from the sales pitch delivered to the American people. Technologies related to the SDI program were in fact used to great effect for communications and surveillance purposes in conflicts in Central America, the Middle East and elsewhere. Interestingly, Mr. Wirble suggests that the outgoing administration of George Bush Sr. had set the table for meaningful disarmament. The author faults Bill Clinton for not seizing the historic opportunity to create a peace dividend in the first post-Cold War administration. Instead, full funding during the 1990s allowed the space technologies industries to mature and gain deadly sophistication, as demonstrated in Kosovo and Columbia later in the decade.<br /><br />However, the failures to capture Osama Bin Laden and to win a decisive victory in the latest Iraq War underscores the limitations of space-based technologies and the application of force to achieve U.S. objectives. Instead, Mr. Wirbel advocates a ban on space weapons and an increased reliance on diplomacy and multilateralism as expressed through organizations such as the United Nations. He believes that peace activists must forge alliances with environmentalists and others to find humane solutions to contemporary political problems.<br /><br />I recommend this book to those who may be concerned about the U.S.' projection of power into space and the implications it may have for our collective security on earth.ies industries to mature and gain deadly sophistication, as demonstrated in Kosovo and Columbia later in the decade. <br /> <br />However, the failures to capture Osama Bin Laden and to win a decisive victory in the latest Iraq War underscores the limitations of space-based technologies and the application of force to achieve U.S. objectives.

The book skillfully blends economic theory with a real-life case study to create a work that is both deeply thought-provoking and dramatic in its narrative. Thoroughly researched and persuasively argued, \\"Killing Me Softly\\" is an excellent book for both students and general readers who may be interested in environmental politics.<br /><br />Girdner and Smith devote the first two chapters explaining how pollution is a systemic problem that is related to capitalism, production and the profit motive. Toxic waste in particularl is associated with the growth of the petrochemical industry in the post-World War II era, which not coincidentally has witnessed the rise of the modern waste disposal industry. The reader understands how the regulatory system seeks merely to contain (but not eliminate) waste and how the market tends to offload this waste onto the poor. The authors draw on Marx to explain that this process is historically linked \\"to the continued process of enclosure\\" of the commons but with the goal to \\"enhance the bottom lines\\" of the politically-powerful corporations that produce and dispose of these wastes.<br /><br />Girdner and Smith then introduces us to the environmental justice movement which seeks to test the theory of grassroots democracy against the reality of corporate control. While minorities and women are most often targeted and disproportionately bear the costs of pollution, the authors argue that the case of Mercer County, Missouri demonstrates that the core issue is class, which in turn is rooted in capitalism's tendency to produce profits for the privileged few at the expense of the many.<br /><br />The chapter about how the close-knit community of rural Mercer County organized to resist the \\"obliteration of a way of life\\" by a major corporation is a remarkable story that is written in a compelling manner. The people's ingenuity and determination to persist and continue their struggle in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds is truly inspiring. The authors go on to share some of the lessons learned from the citizen's victory in Mercer County to provide guidance to others.<br /><br />Ultimately, Girdner and Smith's work helps us recognize the necessity for the environmental justice movement to transcend race and national identities and become a much broader movement that struggles against inequality and capitalist exploitation. In the final chapter, the authors propose six principles for a form of local, sustainable development that would allow people to achieve \\"peace, fulfillment, and happiness\\" in a way that is not dependent on the pursuit of material acquisition.<br /><br />I highly recommend this exceptional book to everyone.elling manner.

Written by eighteen leading thinkers on the Left, the book is a timely and articulate response to the Iraq War and other recent events. In marked contrast to the mainstream media's presentation of these events, the authors of \\"Pox Americana\\" put forward an intelligent, persuasive and clear-eyed assessment of the historic moment. Throughout the book, the reader is rewarded with numerous insights and analyses that are supported by strong research and accessible writing.<br /><br />The editors, John Bellamy Foster and Robert W. McChesney, are among the intellectual vanguard in the fields of environmental economics and media criticism, respectively. The contributors include other well-known names on the Left such as Noam Chomsky and Immanuel Wallerstein and includes authors living outside the U.S., such as Samir Amin and Amiya Kumar Bagchi, who provide an important internationalist perspective. The consensus among this esteemed and diverse group of thinkers that imperialism constitutes the driving force in U.S. policy makes a powerful statement, one that is perhaps directed not only at U.S. political leadership but as a rebuke to other Leftists such as Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri, whose much-heralded book \\"Empire\\" had suggested that the U.S. was a benign power and was not inherently imperialistic.<br /><br />Foster and McChesney grouped the essays into three sections.<br /><br />Part One is titled \\"U.S. Imperialism has a Long History.\\" The four articles in this section solidly connects U.S. imperialism with capitalism and traces this relationship back to the earliest days of the nation. Several authors discuss how the brutal conquest and domination of foreign lands and peoples on behalf of U.S. business interests has traditionally been justified to the American people by the rhetoric of promoting democracy. However, Wallerstein believes that as U.S. economic power declines its imperialistic project will become more difficult to sustain, especially as the U.S. runs into opposition by foreign capitalists working to protect their own competing interests.<br /><br />Part Two is \\"The Geopolitics and Political Economy of U.S. Imperialism.\\" The U.S.' struggle to maintain imperial control over the post-WWII world economy is addressed by the four authors in this section. Michael Klare locates strategic importance in the Persian Gulf and its oil, which the U.S. controls in order to exert the \\"ultimate lever over all competing powers.\\" Peter Gowan describes a world financial system dominated by the U.S. where the European Union (EU) and Japan currently play subservient roles. And in a particularly noteworthy essay written by William Tabb, the author argues that unless the U.S. begins a process of de-militarization and increased development efforts in poor countries, uneven development and political destabilization will persist.<br /><br />Part Three is \\"Resistance.\\" Eight chapters explore resistance movements and solutions to achieving a more equitable and peaceful world. Among the many topics discussed: the possibility of an EU-style capitalism that stresses environmental and social justice in place of U.S.-style militarism; peasant and women's rights struggles against global capital over natural resources and personal freedoms in India; the importance of the state as the best means to aid the poor; the potential of social justice unionization and political action to empower local communities; the potential of the anti-war movement to lead a larger effort against consumerism and environmental exploitation; the imperialists' need to inculcating fear through the media construction of an enemy in order to manipulate public opinion and enact repressive domestic laws; and a fascinating essay by Bill Fletcher, Jr. on the U.S. union movement, whose historic racism and support of imperialism is increasingly collidingwith feelings of betrayal as a result of economic restructuring and globalization.<br /><br />I highly recommend this exceptional book to all.of economic restructuring and globalization.

US	52736752	RWSXXATCXUH5P	0932863353	5435739	CAPITALIST PUNISHMENT	Books	4	11	11	N	Y	Diverse perspectives	\\"Capitalist Punishment\\" is a scholarly but accessible study of the relatively recent phenomenon of prison privatization. Two dozen writers representing academia, human rights organizations, investigative journalism, criminal justice policy, labor and other relevant fields have contributed thoughtful articles to the book. The author's diverse perspectives gives the reader a well-rounded understanding of the subject and no doubt will inspire many to take action and work against the expansion of the industry.<br /><br />The book is a project by Human Rights Internet (HRI) of Ottawa, Canada. HRI is an organization dedicated to education on human rights issues and the role of civil society. Concise and well-written introductory and concluding chapters provide context for a number of sharply-focused articles that drill into specific subjects, such as the effects of prison privatization on women, minorities and prison workers. The book succeeds in informing concerned citizens and policy makers about the myriad obscure issues associated with prison privatization and its strong connection with human rights abuses.<br /><br />The first chapter by Phillip Wood is noteworthy for its excellent theoretical analysis. Mr. Wood examines the rise of the prison industrial complex in the U.S. and concludes that it is a policy response to postmodern economic restructuring. The author finds that the criminalization of race and poverty serves the dual purpose of preserving elitist privileges while preparing the working classes for an accumulation strategy based on capital's intensified exploitation of non-union labor.<br /><br />Another exceptional chapter was contributed by Monique Morris on the topic of the arrested development of African-Americans. Ms. Morris begins by discussing the historical legacy of legally sanctioned punishment against blacks in the U.S. She then finds that current punitive practices are merely an extension of policies that have disenfranchised and disempowered the African-American community for centuries. Private prisons serve to exacerbate these problems by offering a false solution to the media-induced spectacle of African-American criminality.<br /><br />On the whole, the articles in the book strongly suggest that the failures of prison privatization are attributable to the incompatibilty of the private pursuit of profit with the public good of rehabilitation. In order to produce income for shareholders, private prisons routinely skimp on employee training and inmate health care, education, and other vital services. The overcrowding and stress that results often creates conditions where physical and sexual abuse increase, and recidivism predominates as opportunities to properly prepare inmates for reentry into society are lost.<br /><br />The book also adopts somewhat of a social research methodology to compare the experiences in the U.S. -- which has been leading the charge in prison privatization -- with other countries including Canada, the U.K. and Australia. As human rights abuses, poor financial performance and mismanagement of private prisons have become better known, most of these countries have begun to scale back on privatization and return responsibility once more to the public sector. However, many of the authors in the book are concerned that the profit motive will push some corporations to relocate to more easily exploitable countries like South Africa, where the relative absence of regulations and public accountability might well lead to disaster for unprotected inmate populations, families and communities.<br /><br />I recommend this important book to everyone.owered the African-American community for centuries.

In \\"Multitude\\", Hardt and Negri discuss change and the possibility of global democracy, which they define as \\"the rule of everyone by everyone\\". The book offers a unique vision of how such a future might be developing around us and futher rewards its readers with numerous insights and top-notch analysis in a highly readable text.<br /><br />\\"Multitude\\" appears to have been written in part as a response to the criticisms of \\"Empire\\" as presented in the excellent book, \\"Empire's New Clothes: Reading Hardt and Negri\\" edited by Passavant and Dean. For example, \\"Multitude\\" takes a slightly different approach to the themes of U.S. exceptionalism, network power structures, violence and the politics of identity; all of these topics were critiqued at length in \\"Empire's New Clothes\\". Consequently, it appears that Hardt and Negri may have profited from this dialogue and it may also explain why \\"Multitude\\" is a more substantive and less theoretical book than \\"Empire\\".<br /><br />Section One of \\"Multitude\\" is entitled \\"War\\". Hardt and Negri discuss the perpetual state of war as a means to maintain the capitalist world order and social hierarchy. Interestingly, the authors show how insurgencies and counterinsurgencies have both taken on the characteristics of flexible, postmodern production networks. Importantly, the anti-globalization movement is lauded as an example of how such decentralized and distributed networks can support an \\"absolutely democratic organization\\" whose emerging strength might yet constitute the \\"most powerful weapon against the ruling power structure.\\"<br /><br />Section Two is about \\"Multitude\\". The multitude is both plural and multiple, wherein people maintain their individualities but act based on common interests. Hardt and Negri posit that global production is made possible by \\"the commons\\" of language and communications and information networks. Patents, licenses and other tools to control the commons and appropriate wealth for private investors has hampered the productivity of the multitude, the authors believe, thereby creating a tension that might lead to revolution. To that end, recent events in Argentina are held out as examples of how new forms of collaborative democracy might emerge.<br /><br />Section Three is entitled \\"Democracy\\". Hardt and Negri explain how the ecological and economic grievances of the multitude are routinely suppressed in favor of corporate interests. The authors endorse a number of reforms that might alleviate some of the worst excesses -- such as the Tobin Tax on currency trades, the easing of copyright laws and the forgiveness of third world debt -- but they go much further, suggesting that the time may be ripe for a \\"new Magna Carta\\", or a fundamental restructuring of relations between capital and labor. To that end, the authors envision an \\"open-source society\\" of collaboration characterized by the self-rule of the multitude and using the commons as the basis of social and economic production.<br /><br />In my view, one of the key attributes of \\"Multitude\\" is its convincing analysis and description of today's post-democracy world. Hardt and Negri describe how the three major tenets of U.S. democracy -- the media, the separation of powers, and representation -- have been irreparably coopted by corporate power. This, of course, is an observation that has been made elsewhere but rarely with the penetrating analysis and skill that these intelligent authors bring to bear on the subject. If \\"Multitude\\" does nothing else than to serve to widen the discussion on this critically important topic, it will have made an important and lasting contribution.<br /><br />However, I am less convinced that the open-source community envisioned by Hardt and Negri will spontaneously emerge as they have suggested. The disconnect between the aspirations of the multitude for shared peace and prosperity on the one hand and the brutal realities of hierarchical power structures on the other has existed for centuries. While one is certainly hopeful that the historic moment has changed and has made a revolution in human relations possible, the authors provide little in the way of guidance as to how the multitude might cross the divide. Still, \\"Multitude\\" serves as a thought-provoking and inspirational work that helps us understand the reasons why we need to move forward to a more peaceful and humane world, if not how to get there, and easily deserves a five-star rating. I highly recommend it to all.and prosperity on the one hand and the brutal realities of hierarchical power structures on the other has existed for centuries.

The authors offer a bottom-up theory of resistance and describe the conditions by which the modern nation state was founded as a solution to the problem of proletariat self-rule. Short narratives, biographies and illustrations of key events and individuals are framed within a discussion of the historical forces of the era, making the book an interesting, thought provoking and entertaining read.<br /><br />Linebaugh and Rediker describe the brutal process of primitive accumulation where the poor were forced off the land to create the proletariat class. The newly-dispossessed were disciplined harshly and made to labor for the benefit of the investor class. However, the pervasive \\"culture of fear\\" that was \\"indispensible to the creation of labor-power as a commodity\\" eventually led to revolt, first with the English Civil War in the 1640s and later throughout the colonial system.<br /><br />The authors spotlight individuals who made the case for the rights of all people, including Edward Despard, James Naylor, Tom Paine, Thomas Spence and Robert Wedderburn. These voices articulated the desires of the masses to achieve equality and social justice. As these rights were consistently denied, the seeds of discontent and rebellion were planted. When not organizing resistance against empire, many chose piracy, formed their own renegade communities, or chose to live among the Native Americans.<br /><br />In this light, the authors present the American Revolution as a cooptation of the democratic movement. Capitalist property and wage relations were legislated in a manner that secured elitist privilege. Race, sex and class effectively served to split the proletariat into factions that could be politically controlled. The nation state thus was born as an instrument to empower the bourgeoisie and channel the energies of the masses towards capitalist accumulation.<br /><br />The unique value of this book is its convincing argument that the world we know may have turned out very differently. This tantalizing possibility is just one reason why \\"The Many-Headed Hydra\\" is an intriguing read. I highly recommend it to all.The unique value of this book is its convincing argument that the world we know may have turned out very differently.

Mr. Bensaid leads us on an intellectually stimulating journey where we understand how Marx's thought is principally a \\"critical theory of social struggle\\" whose scientific methodology is replete with chaos theory and contingency. That the spectre of really non-existing socialism has allowed an unalloyed Marx to inspire a new generation of anti-globalization protesters and thinkers proves the durability and ongoing relevance of Marx's writings.<br /><br /> The book is divided into three sections. The first is on the topic of historical reason. Marx was opposed to capital's tendency to use its wealth to create systems characterized by domination and dependency. Marx offered a hopeful and alternative vision of how people might channel their material progress towards the liberation of human potential. Therefore, the historical determinism suggested in \\"The Communist Manifesto\\" is but one possible outcome that might result from class struggle. However, it is true that capital frequently shapes history through crises that are usually resolved by political struggle and occassionaly lead to revolutionary change.<br /><br /> The second section focuses on class struggle. Mr. Bensaid cites a number of theorists who have recently sought to wrap Marx into neoliberal market theory, where the invisible hand of the market might result in a just distribution of resources. The author responds to these critics by pointing out that Marx attempted to transcend the struggle between labor and capital (rather than settling for distributive justice, which was an emerging idea in Marx's lifetime). Marx believed that theories of justice and the critique of political economy were irreconcilable; equality would prove elusive as long as the working class was dedicated to producing the surplus value that sustained elitist privilege. Rather, Marx advocated a program of working-class empowerment where the people might administer their own affairs and thereby allow the state to wither away.<br /><br />Section three discusses Marx's approach to the sciences. Mr. Bensaid writes that Marx and his contemporary Charles Darwin stressed instability, disequilibrium and tendential laws that represented a radical upheaval in the scientific thought of the day. In marked contrast with reductionist Newtonian science, Marx and Darwin reveled in chaos bound within systems that could be defined but whose outcomes were not always known. Understanding that quantity is a measure of qualitative processes, Marx criticized the economists of his day for their reductionism by only seeking to measure that which has already been inputed into the capitalist system; by ignoring so-called \\"externalities\\" such as ecological and human costs, Marx reminds us that the abstract measure of labor as money produces a system that is incapable of harmonizing humanity with nature. This insight in turn suggests, in the author's powerful concluding chapter, how an environmentally prophetic Marx could be essential to helping us secure a more humane, democratic and environmentally sustainable future.<br /><br />In today's world where global market irrationalities are leading us towards disaster, Mr. Bensaid is to be commended for solidly reconnecting Marx with contemporary issues and providing insight into how we might do better.am of working-class empowerment where the people might administer their own affairs and thereby allow the state to wither away.<br /><br />Section three discusses Marx's approach to the sciences.

Mr. McMurtry penetrates the palliatives offered up by corporate propagandists to expose the wanton greed of the privileged class and the inherent immorality of capitalism. Importantly, the author also offers a thoughtful and compelling package of socio-economic reforms that, if implemented, might well help secure a measure of real social, economic and environmental justice.<br /><br />Mr. McMurtry is a Professor of Philosophy at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada. His works have been published in over 150 journals and books, including the classic &#34;The Cancer Stage of Capitalism&#34; (1999). The author is recognized as a leader in the anti-globalization and peace movements. His prior life experiences as a football player, journalist and world traveler combine to create probably one of the most original, humane and articulate voices in North America today.<br /><br />The Preface to &#34;Value Wars&#34; compares the fanaticism of the 9/11 hijackers with the corporate value-set. The author contends that the close ties among the business community, the U.S. government and many of the terrorists exemplifies the moral crisis. That the incident has provided a pretext for the U.S. to systematically repress its citizens who are opposed to globalization and to actively colonize strategic nations such as Afghanistan and Iraq merely compounds the situation.<br /><br />&#34;Value Wars&#34; is divided into three sections, as follows:<br /><br />Part I describes &#34;The New World Order&#34; of global capitalism. Mr. McMurtry deconstructs the &#34;inversions of meaning&#34; used by the powerful to gain popular acquiesence for the neoliberal agenda. Corporate control of government and the mass media has resulted in a loss of meaningful dialogue and debate; instead, the fanatical pursuit of private wealth accumulation is proclaimed to be the only viable &#34;choice&#34; for society. But even as social and environmental costs escalate as a consequence of the neoliberal agenda, the state increasingly collaborates with capital in a deliberate manner by negotiating and enforcing pro-corporate trade deals, social program cuts, the sale of state assets, and the application of police and military force.<br /><br />Part II is entitled &#34;Unlocking the Invisible Prison&#34;. Mr. McMurtry's writing is in top form as he explores the methods by which the finance capital system colonizes the minds and bodies of its subjects. Advertising induces consumption through garish &#34;repetitions of mind-shackling misrepresentations&#34; while the media projects false &#34;images of dream-like omnipotence&#34; of the materialist lifestyle. When the social sciences fail to manipulate and condition citizens to behave in the properly prescribed manner, the prison is used to enforce subservience; meanwhile, the author contends that the &#34;real capital criminals&#34; are rewarded with success in the corporate sector.<br /><br />Part III is &#34;The Paradigm Turn: The Life Economy Principles from Where We Stand&#34;. Mr. McMurtry devotes 100 pages to a detailed discussion of a &#34;Life Economy Manifesto&#34; that could help restore equity and sanity to the world. Throughout the discussion, the author's knowledge of history, economics and philosophy helps him build a very credible case for reform. Mr. McMurtry is particularly effective when he shows how really existing capitalism has strayed from its professed principles; the author highlights the contradictions of neoliberal dogma and argues that his proposals offer a better way to achieve peace and prosperity for all. While many of Mr. McMurtry's ideas have been stated elsewhere -- for example, the author advocates taxes on speculative investments, greater public accountability of corporations and the media, reductions in military spending, and so on -- his ability to effectively compare and contrast the corporate &#34;death&#34; economy with his &#34;life&#34; economy alternative frames the discussion in an interesting and uniquely compelling manner.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this powerful and visionary book to everyone.;death&#34; economy with his &#34;life&#34; economy alternative frames the discussion in an interesting and uniquely compelling manner.

In fact, the book's appendix details hundreds of documented instances of largely unexplained voting irregularities. However, problems that may at first glance be explained away as merely examples of isolated system malfunctions comprises only part of the story.<br />Ms. Harris tells us how she aggressively researched the voting machine industry and learned how it works. Far from working solely for the public interest, she found that these privately-owned companies have their own special interests and political agendas in mind when they are not seeking to maximize sales and profits. The author makes clear that these companies have much to gain from placing their own representatives in office, opening up what would appear to be an almost overwhelming temptation to use the technology to engage in fraudulent activities. Indeed, it was interesting to see how many of these corporate roads lead to the state of Texas, individuals who identify themselves as Christian Conservatives, oil industry consultants, and supporters of the Republican Party.<br />Ms. Harris dedicated a great deal of time and effort researching Diebold, whose questionable business practices and unsecure voting machines have been exposed in the media largely due to her efforts. Her discussion with Diebold programmers and others about the mysterious rob-georgia.zip file that appeared on the company's ftp site just prior to the Georgia election in 2002 is fascinating.

The authors posit that the Bush administration has resorted to imperialism as a means of reasserting U.S. control over the world economic system. But by detailing the social, economic and environmental problems that continue to challenge U.S. hegemony, Petras and Veltmeyer believe that U.S. imperialism may be unwittingly accelerating the collapse of capitalism and creating the conditions for a socialist alternative to emerge.<br />James Petras is a Professor at the State Univesity of New York and Henry Veltmeyer is a Professor at Sanit Mary's University. The collaboration works well in this book. It appears that Dr. Veltmeyer's presence may serve to take some of the sting out of Dr. Petras who is a well-known and prolific writer of sometimes blistering socio-political essays. However, the end result is a no less powerful and intriguing book that is at turns analytical, historical, passionate and persuasive.<br />The authors begin by challenging postmodern theories about the 'smooth space' of capitalism made popular in the book &quot;Empire&quot; by Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri by explaining how the war against terrorism has been used by President Bush to advanced U.S. interests in contested places around the world. But while the open-ended war against terror has been successful in transferring wealth to corporations and the wealthy and has served to intimidate many dissenters, the authors believe that the deficits associated with war combined with the ongoing decline in domestic manufacturing industries suggests that imperialism alone will not restore the U.S. to international preeminence.<br />We learn that the brand of neoliberalism championed by the U.S., Europe and Israel has caused political and economic instability in dozens of countries, especially in Central and South America. For example, one chapter in the book is dedicated to the massive worker and peasant mobilizations in Argentina that have sought to restore economic and social justice in the wake of that country's dramatic economic collapse. The authors go on to describe how the U.S. has returned to such Cold War shenanigans as military coups, economic blackmail, covert military actions and other tactics in order to repress similar popular uprisings in places such as Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Venzuela. The authors contend that these efforts have pushed most world governments to the political Right even as economic deprivation pushes many of their citizens to the Left, thereby &quot;setting the stage for a classic confrontation between dictatorial reaction and revolution&quot;.<br />Other chapters are dedicated to the collapse of the cod industry in the Northern Atlantic, the uprisings of indigenous peoples in Ecuador and Mexico, the struggles of Latin American peasants against the state, the anti-globalization movement, and more. The authors convincingly argue that the state's defense of capital is central to class struggle but that popular &quot;direct and collective action&quot; can empower the people to create better lives for themselves. On the other hand, the authors admit that part of the challenge for the Left is to unite these diverse movements in a way that provides a credible socialist challenge to capitalism.<br />Recent Socialist electoral victories in Spain and India appears to support the authors' thesis in what may prove to be a remarkably prescient work.

Professor Saney's work shatters the mainstream caricature of Cuba as a nation that history has left behind. To the contrary, the author describes the dynamic and ongoing processes through which the Cuban people have struggled to achieve social justice. As Dr. Saney has demonstrated in this excellent book, the modern Cuban experience is without doubt one of the most remarkable stories of our time, offering insights about how humanity might secure a more peaceful, stable and liveable world.<br />Dr. Saney is an Associate Director at Henson College, Dalhousie University in Canada. He is a frequent visitor to Cuba and conducts scholarly work in the fields of international development, political economy and law. The author is skilled at explaining Cuban political philosophy and helps us understand how the Cuban decision making process reflects the collectivist values of its society.<br />The book has six chapters. The first is about the history of Cuba especially as it relates to slavery, U.S. economic dominance and Cuba's dependence on the Soviet Union. The so-called 'Special Period' that began as the result of the collapse of the U.S.S.R. is also covered in detail. Dr. Saney tells us that despite extreme economic hardship and mounting hostility from the U.S., the Revolution has been reaffirmed by the Cuban people. The author describes the many reforms that have been implemented in order to stabilize the economy and ensure that commitments to social justice remain intact for all its citizens.<br />The second chapter discusses governance, perhaps one of the most misunderstood aspects of modern Cuban society. Dr. Saney states that the goal of the Cuban political system is to &quot;extend democracy to both the political and economic spheres&quot; by enshrining these rights in its constitution. In practice, free elections, unions and mass organizations allow for Cuban democracy to act as a force that shapes society from the bottom-up.<br />Chapter three addresses race and inequality. Dr. Saney shows us how Cuba has transformed itself from a highly-stratified society to one of the most egalitarian in the world. The author contends that the Cuban state's eradication of the economic basis of racism offers proof that the &quot;abolishment of the capitalist order [is] an indispensable step towards the elimination of racism&quot;.<br />Chapter four is on the topic of crime and justice. Chapter five is about U.S. and Cuban history with an emphasis on recent events. While the Cuban justice system as described by Dr. Saney appears to compare favorably to most others in Latin America, ongoing U.S. hostility has meant that Cuba must make special provisions in its law to protect itself. If Cuba is to be castigated for punishing mercenaries, spies and other aggressors, then it is not unreasonable for the U.S. to cease its ongoing economic embargo, subversive activities and hostile rhetoric.<br />The final chapter focuses on the lessons learned from the Cuban experience. Dr. Saney discusses Cuba's significant contributions to the world community in organic farming, biotechnology and health care. Other noteworthy accomplishments that the author highlights include the Cuban military's support of Angola (which was a critical factor in freeing the South African people from apartheid) and the leadership role that Cubans have played in various international human rights organizations. The author also believes that the Cuban people will be successful in protecting socialism even as it opens its economy to foreign investment.<br />Cuba is not a perfect society, but Dr. Saney has amply demonstrated in this book that Cuba's vitality continues to pose a challenge to the &quot;inherent injustice and unsustainability&quot; of capitalism. I encourage everyone to read this outstanding book to learn more about the Cuban experience and to gain insight into how we might secure a better future for all.more about the Cuban experience and to gain insight into how we might secure a better future for all.	2004-04-25

In this fascinating book, Dr. Huws has developed an original and compelling critique of contemporary capitalism. While the articles span from the 1970s to the early 2000s, the analyses are consistently razor-sharp and the insights remain as valid today as when they were originally conceived and written.<br />Dr. Huws has worked for many years as an activist, researcher and free lance writer living in Great Britain. She currently serves as a Professor at London Metropolitan University. Both the immediacy and the solid scholarship that infuses her writing is evidence of these myriad roles as well as Dr. Huws' professionalism and dedication to her work.<br />Integral to Dr. Huws' analysis is the Marxist-inspired concept of commodification, or capitalism's tendency to draw into the cash economy activities which had been previously carried out by unpaid labor. For example, the hand-washing of clothes is replaced by the laundromat and in turn by the home washing machine. With each succeeding wave of technological advancement, the division of labor increases in a manner that richly rewards technical specialists while it enslaves large masses of deskilled workers and consumers into an increasingly tenuous and impoverished lifestyle.<br />But Dr. Huws goes well beyond Marx by emphasizing the Feminist identification of the home (not the factory) as the primary locus of struggle. As telecommunications and computer technologies increasingly blur the distinctions between home and office, it is the female who disproportionately bears the cost of capitals' expansion, Dr. Huws posits. Capital benefits from technological innovations such as self-service banking, for example, mainly by offloading laborious tasks onto consumers. Dr. Huws goes on to state that the machines, laws and social norms that regulate domestic female behavior turns housework into \\"drudgery\\" and helps extend and enforce the sphere of male domination and control.<br />Within this general analytical framework, individual chapters are dedicated to discussions of the Internet and its facilitation of corporate restructuring and the outsourcing of work overseas; how women's health suffers due to inequalities in the workplace and the female ethic of sacrificial caregiving; technology's role in the failure of collectivity in the 1970s, the rise of individualism and the decline of the public sphere from the 1980s to today; the debunking of postmodern theories pertaining to the supposed dematerialization of the economy; the contestation of time wrought by the automation of routine tasks and the application of Taylorist management principles; the myriad challenges of forming a \\"cybertariat\\" class consciousness in a contingent global economy that is segmented by space, status and culture; and more.<br />At the close of each chapter, Dr. Huws ponders how citizens might wrest control of the work processes and technologies controlled by capital and state in order to channel it towards the cause of enriching society and empowering people.<br />I highly recommend this superbly researched, persuasively argued and highly readable book to everyone.ework into \\"drudgery\\" and helps extend and enforce the sphere of male domination and control. <br />Within this general analytical framework, individual chapters are dedicated to discussions of the Internet and its facilitation of corporate restructuring and the outsourcing of work overseas; how women's health suffers due to inequalities in the workplace and the female ethic of sacrificial caregiving; technology's role in the failure of collectivity in the 1970s, the rise of individualism and the decline of the public sphere from the 1980s to today; the debunking of postmodern theories pertaining to the supposed dematerialization of the economy; the contestation of time wrought by the automation of routine tasks and the application of Taylorist management principles; the myriad challenges of forming a \\"cybertariat\\" class consciousness in a contingent global economy that is segmented by space, status and culture; and more. <br />At the close of each chapter, Dr. Huws ponders how citizens might wrest control of the work processes and technologies controlled by capital and state in order to channel it towards the cause of enriching society and empowering people.<br />I highly recommend this superbly researched, persuasively argued and highly readable book to everyone.	2004-03-30
US	52736752	R2KIXAIUI9C0H4	0520224639	571216960	Disposable People: New Slavery in the Global Economy	Books	5	42	42	N	Y	The race to the very bottom	\\"Disposable People\\" by Kevin Bales is an important book on the topic of slavery in our time. The author intelligently combines original cases studies and third-party research with a solid understanding of global economics. The result is a startling but convincing expose that should be read by everyone.<br />Mr. Bales describes the major factors driving slavery today. First, the post-WW II population explosion has created a huge and desperate reserve army of the unemployed. Second, the process of proletarianization continues in many so-called \\"developing\\" nations as millions of peasant farmers are displaced by mechanization. Third, economic globalization serves to break down the social fabric as materialism and greed substitutes for the communal values that prevail in peasant societies.<br />Mr. Bales is careful to contrast the \\"New Slavery\\" of today with the \\"Old Slavery\\" of the past. The New Slavery is clearly embedded within the logic of post-industrial production, where capital avoids its social and environmental responsibilities and ruthlessly exploits human and natural resources for maximum profit. In this light, the New Slavery represents the race to the very bottom of a brutal system that is controlled by speculative investors and is accountable to no one.<br />Case studies examining prostitution in Thailand and coal production in the Brazilian rainforest help us further understand the dynamics of the New Slavery. Subcontractors do the dirty work of luring and keeping laborers in servitude while shielding owners from justice. Mr. Bales tells us that in the case of Brazil, the landowners who blithely ignore such practices include some of the largest corporations in the world.<br />The Old Slavery defined by the traditional master/slave relationship has survived into the present as well. Mr. Bales courageously traveled to the police state of Mauritania to gather evidence of slavery at great risk to himself and the locals who assisted him. The author devotes chapters to Old Slavery practices in India and Pakistan, where repressive sexist, class, and religious beliefs enforce an essentially Feudal social order. However, Mr. Bales makes clear that the economic forces unleashed by globalization are effectively breathing new life into these ancient practices. For example, upper caste slave owners in India are heavily dependent on slave labor to support both their privileged social positions and their increasingly Western-style consumerist lifestyle.<br />As many in the U.S. theorize and debate from their easy chairs about the reasons why industrial jobs may be rotating to low-wage countries, Mr. Bales' book effectively shocks us from our complacency. As amply demonstrated in this book, slavery is an expression of the infinite demands of capital taken to its logical conclusion. Clearly, eradicating slavery is essential to reclaiming our humanity. To that end, Mr. Bales makes a number of policy recommendations and provides resources at the end of the book to help readers get involved in the anti-slavery struggle.<br />I give this sensitive, perceptive and important book the highest recommendation possible.chapters to Old Slavery practices in India and Pakistan, where repressive sexist, class, and religious beliefs enforce an essentially Feudal social order.

US	52736752	RZBTKLJHWTDZ9	1583225579	133880975	Information War: American Propaganda, Free Speech, and Opinion Control Since 9/11	Books	5	61	68	N	Y	Remarkably informative, incisive and persuasive	&quot;Information War&quot; by Nancy Snow is a brilliant and biting critique of the Bush administration's use of propaganda to promote its war on terror. Throughout, Dr. Snow's subject matter expertise fuses perfectly with her sense of moral clarity to produce a work that is remarkably informative, incisive and persuasive.<br />Dr. Snow has worked in academia for over ten years. She is an in-demand lecturer and commentator and has written other books and numerous papers. Importantly, Dr. Snow has served in the USIA, a propaganda agency within the U.S. government, providing the author with inside knowledge about how the U.S. propaganda machine works. Through her education and life experiences, Dr. Snow appears to be on her way to becoming a noteworthy and influential critic who, in my view, might be compared with the likes of Noam Chomsky and Howard Zinn.<br />The foreward is by star investigative journalist Greg Palast, who explains that propaganda is necessary to achieve thought control in a democratic society. Mr. Palast states that today's crop of U.S. spin masters are most interested in projecting American military and commercial power in pursuit of corporate objectives. Mr. Palast writes that the image of &quot;armed and dangerous refugees from corporate boards&quot; who have gained control of America presents a frightening picture to everyone concerned about the consequences of unrestrained and corrupt power.<br />Dr. Snow beings by arguing that the increasing concentration of media ownership stifles dissent and allows the powerful to define the public interest. The author documents the close ties between intelligence agencies and the media to show how the Pentagon increasingly defines what gets reported. Combined with a compliant media that is more interested in generating advertising revenues than meaningful debate, the declining state of critical journalism as described by the author is not surprising.<br />Dr. Snow compares propagandists past and present to show how discourse can often be manipulated in the pusuit of specific objectives. For example, Dr. Snow shows how George Creel's campaign to convince the public to enter World War I bears similarities to Charlotte Beer's Madison Avenue-style &quot;branding&quot; campaign of America during the Afghanistan War. The author says that the goal in both cases was to &quot;convince the American people...that this war was a fight over ideas and values more than a fight over land, people and resources.&quot; Ultimately, Dr. Snow explains that Ms. Beer's efforts were ineffective because the rhetoric of her ill-conceived advertising campaign clashed badly with the reality of America's role as a &quot;violent international aggressor.&quot;<br />One of my favorite sections was Dr. Snow's delicious skewering of William Bennett, one of the most pompous of all propagandists. The author deftly uses Mr. Bennett's own work against him, arguing that the suffocating intolerance displayed in his book &quot;Why We Fight&quot; clearly illustrates why dissent is critical to maintaining a free and open society.<br />A few courageous citizens who have spoken truth to power are profiled in the book. These include publisher Janis Besler Heaphy, who was shouted down at a college graduation ceremony for advocating sustained public vigilance of government action; Congresswoman Barbara Lee, who cast the lone vote against Bush's manifesto to wage an open-ended war against terrorism; and author Howard Zinn, whose work for peace has inspired many. Through these and other examples, Dr. Snow highlights the critical role that individuals can play to protect our collective rights.<br />On the other hand, Dr. Snow believes that the Bush administration's unilateralism and use of preemption will not lead to a better world. Dr. Snow argues that the so-called &quot;Arab Street&quot; (another pejorative and propagandistic term) is angry with the U.S. because of very specific policies and not because of our core values, as is often alleged. However, defining the conflict in simplistic terms enhances the effectiveness of the propaganda and marginalizes anti-war critics. In fact, Dr. Snow reminds us that many of the words spoken by prominent figures such as Martin Luther King, Jr., who sometimes railed against U.S. imperialism and war, have long ago been forgotten in corporate news archives.<br />Instead of being passive recipients, Dr. Snow encourages her readers to actively seek alternative media and to critique and respond to biased news reporting. She recommends that we work to change our government's policies and spend more time listening to others in order to achieve harmony with the world. I found Dr. Snow's common-sense and humane suggestions to be a welcome antidote to the angry and propaganda-soaked material that is usually found on mainstream media.<br />I strongly encourage everyone to read this inspirational, informative and empowering book.ore values, as is often alleged.

The analysis is consistently incisive, penetrating and thought-provoking; many of the contributors offer their own theories and challenge Hardt and Negri's interpretation of the works of Deleuze and Guattari, Foucault, Marx, Spinoza and others. The result is a book that pushes the debate about \\"Empire\\" to a new level of philosophical sophistication.<br />Interestingly, each chapter focuses on a particular theme found in Hardt and Negri's \\"Empire\\". For example, \\"Immanence\\", \\"Transcendence\\" and the \\"Market\\" comprise the subtitles of the first three chapters, respectively. I found this helpful as it provides value when using the book as a research tool.<br />In several essays, Hardt and Negri's concept of the 'multitude' is critiqued. Instead of a multitudinous and spontaneous 'being-against' Empire as envisioned by Hardt and Negri, Ernesto Laclau argues that \\"any 'multitude' is constructed through political action - which presupposes antagonism\\". Because Laclau believes that \\"political articulation\\" will be needed to coordinate struggles among diverse groups to achieve liberation, he concludes that \\"Empire\\" offers \\"incoherence\\" between mobilizing the multitude and achieving specific political objectives.<br />Peter Fitzpatrick points out inconsistencies in Hardt and Negri's theory of U.S. exceptionalism. The assertion that the U.S. serves as the vital center of global economics clashes with Hardt and Negri's claim that the U.S. 'is not [Empire's] center'. Fitzpatrick goes on to highlight the imperialistic and exclusionary history of U.S. conquest and expansion to contend that the U.S. record has not been substantially different from past and present European empires, in turn implying that historical circumstances have not changed significantly enough to suppose that Hardt and Negri's revolution might occur anytime soon.<br />Kevin Dunn contributed a very interesting essay about Africa's ambiguous relation to Empire. Challenging Hardt and Negri's assertion that there is no 'outside' to Empire, Dunn describes African power relations to show that the continent does not conform to the Western development model. The militarization of borders in Africa and elsewhere argues against Hardt and Negri's 'smooth space' of Empire. The embrace of a uniquely conservative brand of Christianity among many in Africa also suggests that differences within the multitude pose problems for mobilization as envisioned by Hardt and Negri but may suggest alternative strategies for organizing resistance against Empire.<br />However, my favorite essay was the feminist critique penned by Lee Quinby, who compares the millennial rhetoric found in \\"Empire\\" with the use of dualities (such as good versus evil) in the Christian Bible. Quinby finds fault with the assertion that the revolt against Empire will be an us-against-them event as depicted by Hardt and Negri. Quinby also critiques Hardt and Negri for overlooking Foucault's lesson that resistance against power manifests in many forms and for different reasons. This point leads Quinby to a discussion of Hardt and Negri's failure to locate gender as the predominant source of power, violence and poverty. Ultimately, Quinby cites Amartya Sen's work about women's struggles as offering greater insight into the \\"intricate gendered relations between sovereign power and biopwer\\" when compared with \\"Empire\\".<br />Jodi Dean's article about \\"communicative capitalism\\" was also informative. Dean addresses the problem of articulating politics in a communications media dominated by large corporations that mainly produce what Hardt and Negri term 'spectacle'. Dean believes that Hardt and Negri offer \\"hope\\" but little concrete evidence that the multitude might be successful in constructing a language of liberation in the face of such overwhelming oppositional power.<br />In a keysection, Michael Hardt answers some of the critics in an interview with Thomas Dumm. Hardt states that he and Negri recognize the need to develop a more comprehensive theory of the multitude and its possibility of realizing a political form, which he believes is the book's greatest shortcoming. Hardt also responds to some who objected to the \\"eclecticism\\" found in \\"Empire\\", contending that \\"dogmatism\\" stifles understanding and that communist thought does not necessarilly begin and end with Marx. Hardt defends the idea that the nation-state must be overcome to achieve \\"absolute democracy\\"; elsewhere, he explains why he and Negri reformulated Foucault's top-down conception of \\"biopower\\" into a bottom-up theory of emancipation.<br />Other noteworthy articles include Malcolm Bull, who stresses the importance of politics that are founded in hybrid cultural identities; William Chaloupka, who faults \\"Empire\\" for offering a weak environmental critique of capitalism; Saskia Sassen, who finds in many political struggles identifications with particular urban locales and disadvantaged populations; Ruth Buchanan and Sundhya Pahuja, who discuss the role of the World Bank and the nation-state in controlling and enforcing the world market system; Slavoj Zizek, who contends that the state is exercising power in the \\"strongest\\" terms yet, as evidenced by the war on terror; Kam Shapiro, who envisions a politics of diversity that is \\"experimental, tactical and provisional\\", as opposed to uniform; and Paul Passavant and Jodi Dean's concluding essay on the need to resurrect a politics that values life and non-capitalist values in a manner that provides \\"a more adequate response\\" to the threat of terrorism than surveillance, oppression and war.<br />I highly recommend this outstanding book to everyone who has read \\"Empire\\" and may want to further their understanding of its key themes and ideas.ey section, Michael Hardt answers some of the critics in an interview with Thomas Dumm.

The thoroughly readable book is full of insights and should interest all readers of 20th century American history. It will also prompt many to ponder how America might try to heal its frayed society while there is time available to do so.<br />In the Acknowledgements, Ms. Cohen explains that this impressive book was written over the course of ten years. Her thesis profited from audience feedback at numerous college lectures and presentations she made during this time and with able assistance from a number of talented student researchers. With over 400 pages of text and 100 pages of notes, the book represents a remarkable achievement and is a testament to Ms. Cohen's intelligent use of the academic research process.<br />Ms. Cohen is in top form when she chronicles the struggles of women and African-Americans to assert their rights in what she calls the \\"Consumers' Republic\\" of 1945 to 1975. The author provides background material by documenting how a variety of bread-and-butter consumer issues mobilized millions into action from the Depression through WWII. Ms. Cohen then shows how power gained by women and minorities through their contributions to the war effort later found expression in the Civil Rights, women's liberation and other movements of the 1950s and 1960s.<br />However, Ms. Cohen explains that policy makers in the aftermath of WWII were influenced and corrupted by, among other things, unparalleled levels of corporate power and ideological rivalry with the Soviet Union. Mass consumption was seen as a solution to help keep manufacturing profits high and was propagandized in order prove to the world that the U.S. was practically a classless society. The reality was different, of course. The author discusses how racial, gender and class biases were reaffirmed and institutionalized by the GI Bill and other legislative acts. As a result of Ms. Cohen's extraordinary research, the reader comes to understand that the increasingly stratified post-WWII American society that resulted was not inevitable but was shaped by powerful interests who privileged private sector solutions at the expense of the public.<br />In my view, the only shortcomings in this ambitious book are Ms. Cohen's failure to discuss the environmental consequences of consumerism and her omission of the student revolt against the military/industrial complex in the 1960s.

The author very effectively cuts through the political doublespeak of recent U.S. administrations to show that neoliberalism has served as the guiding principle for both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. Following a careful and methodical critique of the Clinton/Bush record, Mr. Pollin advances an alternative set of policy proscriptions that might lead us towards a more equitable, stable and prosperous world.<br />Mr. Pollin is a Professor at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. The humanity and practicality that infuses this book is no doubt a reflection of Mr. Pollin's real world experiences, which includes work on developing living wage proposals in various U.S. cities, serving as a consultant to the United Nations Development Program in Bolivia, and as Economic Spokesperson to the 1992 Presidential campaign of Governor Jerry Brown.<br />Neoliberalism is defined by the \\"Washington consensus\\" of decreased government spending, free trade and deregulated markets. Mr. Pollin critiques the system for its three major defects: The \\"Marx problem\\" pertaining to the relative bargaining relationship between employers and workers; the \\"Keynes problem\\" of the tendency of financial markets to engage in speculation; and the \\"Polanyi problem\\" of the corrupting effect of corporate power.<br />The author builds a convincing case that all three problems have been exacerbated by neoliberalist policies, resulting in a host of deleterious effects. These include widening gaps between the rich and poor (Marx), speculative bubbles in the financial markets (Keynes), accounting scandals (Polanyi), and others. Moreover, the author provides research to show that the cumulative effect of these policies has been to slow world economic growth, thereby undoing years of progress and preventing many developing nations from significantly raising living standards for their citizens.<br />Mr. Pollin critiques the Clinton administration and Robert Rubin in particular for championing financial market deregulation as the linchpin for its \\"Eisenhower Republican\\" economic strategy. The author is presuasive in detailing how the stock market boom of the 1990s provided fuel for the economic boom; unfortunately, its demise quickly erased most of the gains attributed to the Clinton economy, such as a real decrease in the number of persons living in poverty. In fact, the author suggests that the single-minded pursuit of a balanced budget allowed Clinton to squander a historic opportunity to use surplus government dollars to invest in education, healthcare and the environment --programs that the author believes are critical to creating a more durable kind of prosperity for the American people.<br />Mr. Pollin launches a no less scathing critique of the Bush administration's policies, which the author believes have been designed to be little more than a \\"bonanza to the rich\\" at the expense of workers. The author explains that crisis has been used by Bush to justify giveaways to corporations and the wealthy; meanwhile, aggressively anti-labor and anti-environmental policies have further squeezed living standards for most. Furthermore, by highlighting the inconsistencies in Bush's budget proposals, Mr. Pollin suggests that the administration is intent on creating a fiscal crisis in order to force a dismantling of the populist social safety net.<br />One section that I found particularly interesting was Mr. Pollin's discussion of stimulating the economy by means of defense spending and the Iraq war. His analysis of the situation however suggests that the occupation of Iraq will further slow the U.S. economy as a whole but will benefit specific corporations engaged in the production and distribution of oil, thereby calling into question the real motives for the war.<br />Mr. Pollin dedicates a chapter examining the \\"landscapeof global austerity\\" that has resulted from Washington's imposition of neoliberal policies onto the developing world. The analysis focuses on case studies in India, Argentina and elsewhere to highlight the human costs of the neoliberal experiment in specific countries. For example, the author shows how Asian sweatshop bosses have repressed their workers in order to gain competitive advantage for their export-oriented economies. The author argues that \\"policies to eliminate sweatshops and guarantee workers decent...minimum wages\\" are needed to narrow inequality, restore impoverished communities and develop new markets.<br />The final chapter explores the author's alternative economic policies more fully. The recommendations include full-employment policies, living wages and labor rights to solve the Marx problem, and financial system regulation, taxation, and increased banking reserve requirements to solve the Keynes problem. The issue is one of morality as well. Recalling Adam Smith, the author suggests that continuing with the failed neoliberal experiment of privileging the interests of capital over the rights of people amounts to \\"corruption of moral sentiments on a global scale\\" and should rightly yield to an economics dedicated to equity and social justice.<br />I strongly recommend this powerful, insightful and humane book to everyone.ape of global austerity\\" that has resulted from Washington's imposition of neoliberal policies onto the developing world.

If we are fortunate enough to survive the future that Chomsky depicts, history will no doubt be indebted to the truths that are revealed in this important book -- as well as to the people who may have drawn our attention to it.<br /><br />Chomsky discusses how U.S. foreign policy has been designed to mostly serve elite economic interests since the end of WWII. He argues that deteriorating living conditions for most of the world's people are of little concern to those in power, as evidenced by the long record of U.S. support for dictators who have brutally repressed their citizens and organized labor. Rather, the primary objective has been to create a favorable business environment and thereby ensure predictable financial returns for investors.<br /><br />As military technology has become more lethal, Chomsky believes that humanity has entered a very dangerous era. Technological superiority tempts those in power to use it to gain advantage, as evidenced in the Iraq War. But the author warns that if and when the poor and excluded masses choose to exact retribution against the U.S., the results could be devastating. The terrorist attacks are but one example of such a \\"blowback\\" to U.S. foreign policy. However, Chomsky contends that policy makers are prepared to accept the public safety risks associated with maintaining vast nuclear and conventional weapons aresenals as well as the potential loss of life from terrorism: the need to project U.S. power and thereby create political and economic hegemony over the world is tantamount and cannot be compromised.<br /><br />Consequently, Chomsky's response to the post-9/11 question of \\"Why do they hate us?\\" is much more satisfactory than the sound bite offered up by President Bush. The author makes clear that tensions in the Middle East are directly attributable to the U.S.' imperialistic desire to control the world's oil supply. But Chomsky suggests that the lifting of sanctions in the 1990s might have strengthened Iraq's democracy and could have led to Saddam's ousting from power, thereby alleviating the need for war. Chomsky is also highly critical of Israel, including its close relationship with the U.S. and how Israel has mishandled the Palestinian homeland issue.<br /><br />Interestingly, Chomsky turns the U.S.' official definition of 'terrorism' around to make the charge that the U.S. has routinely engaged in terrorism itself, citing for example the contra wars in Central America in the 1980s. On the other hand, Chomsky reveals sources who testify that the Iraq war has increased Al Qaeda recruitment. Chomsky's point is to move beyond rhetoric and to search for solutions; the author believes that terrorism can only be subdued by addressing core social, economic and political inequities wherever they might exist.<br /><br />In the final chapter, Chomsky details how the militarization of space costitutes the logical next step on America's path to global dominance. The U.S. is currently seeking to develop first-strike capability from space that could be used against virtually any target in the world. However, Chomsky is hopeful that the global justice movements can be mobilized to rollback this project while it is still in its early stages and help restore peace and sanity to the world.<br /><br />I highly recommend this intelligently written and thoroughly researched work to humane people everywhere.sts that the lifting of sanctions in the 1990s might have strengthened Iraq's democracy and could have led to Saddam's ousting from power, thereby alleviating the need for war.

US	52736752	R8AAYNC5FXN9F	1859844529	464024356	Debating Empire (New Left Review Debates)	Books	5	48	49	N	Y	Critical perspective	&quot;Debating Empire&quot; is dedicated to critiquing Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri's noteworthy book &quot;Empire&quot;. Editor Gopal Balakrishnan presents eleven exceptional essays from leading Leftist intellectuals who each subject &quot;Empire&quot; to analysis. (Please note however that there is no section in this book where &quot;Hardt and Negri respond to their [critics'] questions and criticisms&quot; as suggested in the description above.)<br />While most of the essayists credit &quot;Empire&quot; for pushing the debate about globalization to the fore, the critics often challenge Hardt and Negri's theories. In the Introduction, Gopal Balakrishnan writes that probably the most contentious issue is the role of the U.S. in international affairs. Hardt and Negri (who, it should be noted, wrote their book in the mid-1990s) contend that U.S. influence acts as a stablizing global force. While nearly every critic in &quot;Debating Empire&quot; refutes this claim -- citing as evidence the U.S. government's response to the September 11 attacks and subsequent Iraq war -- Mr. Balakrishnan suggests that Hardt and Negri are to be commended for posing the crucial question of U.S. hegemony for scrutiny.<br />Many contributors commend &quot;Empire&quot; for its historical analysis  but take issue with the book's conclusions. For example, the first essay by Michael Rustin generally agrees with Hardt and Negri's &quot;depiction...of the capitalist economy&quot; but questions that a &quot;universal proletariat&quot; may have emerged. Mr. Rustin believes that Hardt and Negri's anarchist vision of a harmonious future that can exist without the need for government is premature and &quot;unrealistically optimistic&quot;. To the contrary, Mr. Rustin thinks that Hardt and Negri may have overlooked the &quot;darker possibilities&quot; of unchecked U.S. economic, political and military power, including the effect that propaganda may have on mobilizing citizens to support violent state action.<br />On the other hand, Malcolm Bull posits that the U.S. could indeed offer a model for &quot;a different type of totalitarianism&quot; where the social contract might allow individuals to live freely and in a mutually supportive manner. But unlike Hardt and Negri, Mr. Bull believes that significant change must occur in the U.S. for this positive outcome to be achieved. The key, Mr. Bull suggests, is whether the U.S. might respond to the terrorist threat in the long run by offering a program of inclusiveness that eradicates global inequities and instills harmony among citizens -- which unfortunately appears not to be the case at the moment.<br />Hardt and Negri's somewhat abstract assertion that capitalist power is ubiquituous and therefore exists as a 'non-place' is challenged by Ellen Meiskins Wood, who asserts that the nation state remains an essential building block of globalization. Tom Mertes' essay about the many recent struggles waged against capital in Central and South America similarly stresses the importance of place, writing that &quot;messy, mass-scale face-to-face encounters are the life-blood of any movement&quot;. Other contributors who generally concur with this critique include Stanley Aronowitz and Sanjay Seth.<br /><br />Alex Callinicos discusses Negri's career in the Italian Autonomous movement in order to deconstruct Negri's thought. Mr. Callinicos concludes that &quot;Empire&quot; is the result of Negri's fascinating relationship with &quot;applied postructuralist philosophy&quot; but little more, in that it offers &quot;no strategic guidance&quot; for those who seek to effect change in the real world. After suggesting that the uneveness of capitalist development might define where worker struggles can be focused, Mr. Callinicos declares that Negri's abstract ideas are &quot;an obstacle to the development of a successful movement against the global capitalism whose structures he seeks to plot in 'Empire'&quot;. In a similar vein,Charles Tilly, Leo Panitch and Sam Gindin in their essays find fault with Hardt and Negri's idealism and lack of pragmatism.<br />Perhaps the most fundamental critique, however, is delivered by Timothy Brennan who takes issue with Hardt and Negri's research methodology. Mr. Brennan accuses the authors of &quot;assemblage&quot;, or the technique of ripping conceptual ideas away from their historical contexts, which has resulted in a corruption of Hardt and Negri's &quot;entire apparatus of seeing and presenting&quot; history. Mr. Brennan challenges the &quot;millenarian&quot; rhetoric used by Hardt and Negri to claim that 'the multitude called Empire into being', countering that globalization is &quot;a vast enterprise set up to encourage capital mobility while domesticating labor&quot;.<br />Giovanni Arrighi's essay is unique in that his own writing was cited extensively in &quot;Empire&quot;. Mr. Arrighi compliments Hardt and Negri's work in general but corrects what he contends are misrepresentations of his thought in the book. Taking a long-term view at the rise of capitalism, Mr. Arrighi believes that Hardt and Negri may simply be premature in announcing that globalization has created a seamless world. Mr. Arrighi argues that the divide between rich and poor nations proves that boundaries still matter, and that it might take a century or longer to create a situation where all the world's people feel a sense of shared solidarity and feel compelled to rise up against capitalism.<br />Personally, I found Mr. Arrighi's comments to be particularly insightful, for the following reasons. It appears to me that Hardt and Negri's analysis could prove valuable to so-called &quot;Red/Green&quot; thinkers who theorize that the multitude's collective experience with environmental scarcity could lead to solidarity and an eventual overthrow of capitalism. Hardt and Negri's declaration that an 'outside' to capital no longer exists appears to be a prerequisite for such a shared experience to occur -- but it also makes sense, as Mr. Arrighi suggests, that this process will likely take many years to unfold.<br />Of course, helping to form your own conclusions about the meaning of the book &quot;Empire&quot; is what makes &quot;Debating Empire&quot; so rewarding. The high level discourse provided by the essayists helps flesh out &quot;Empire's&quot; arguments and provides added critical perspective for the reader. To that end, I highly recommend &quot;Debating Empire&quot; to anyone who has read &quot;Empire&quot; and wants to further explore the book's provocative, contentious and illuminating themes and ideas in greater detail.arles Tilly, Leo Panitch and Sam Gindin in their essays find fault with Hardt and Negri's idealism and lack of pragmatism.<br />Perhaps the most fundamental critique, however, is delivered by Timothy Brennan who takes issue with Hardt and Negri's research methodology.

US	52736752	R6YEHWOE4UXUT	156584808X	209803217	Power Play: The Fight to Control the Worlds Electricity	Books	5	11	13	N	Y	An articulate critic of corporate power	Hegel once remarked that the only thing people learn from history is that people have learned nothing from history. To that end, the philosopher no doubt would have been intrigued by Sharon Beder's outstanding book \\"Power Play.\\" In it, the author shows how the neo-liberal ideologies and financial self-interests that once conspired to create chaos in the electric power industry in the 1930s have been resurrected in our own time to produce similarly disastrous results. Importantly, her analysis helps us understand what needs to be done to restore order to an out-of-control system that garners most of its profits at the public's expense.<br />In my estimation, Sharon Beder has established herself as one of the most articulate critics of corporate power. As a Professor of Social Sciences, Media and Communications in Australia, Ms. Beder has demonstrated in prior books such as \\"Global Spin\\" a remarkable knack for deconstructing propaganda and uncovering the agendas that are often hidden behind corporate messages. I found \\"Power Play\\" to be a carefully reasoned, well-supported and convincing piece of research that makes for compelling reading.<br />The book is divided into five sections. The first deals with the history of power politics in the U.S. for most of the 20th century. We learn how private interests used the media and political influence to promote deregulation, and how the industry's eventual implosion was a major contributing factor in the stock market crash of 1929 and subsequent Great Depression. The second section discusses the push to deregulate in the latter part of the century to the present day. We see how legislation enacted in the 1930s to protect against corporate abuse was eventually rolled back, which in turn set the stage for companies like Enron to suffer a fate similar to that which befell Samuel Insull's energy empire in the 1930s.<br />The third, fourth and fifth sections deal with deregulation in Britain, Australia and other parts of the world. The global perspective provided by Ms. Beder is useful. Clearly, ideology and financial interests have been the driving forces behind the privatization agenda; interestingly, we learn that the outcomes in various locales have been remarkably similar. Ms. Beder relates how large corporations are often able to exercise market power in order to extort unusually large fees from their customers. The winners are large industrial users and the banks, investors and consultants working on behalf of the energy companies. The losers include taxpayers, farmers, the poor, small businesses and the environment.<br />In my opinion, although \\"Power Play\\" does not explicitly tie the economic inefficiencies of the deregulated power industry with the current economic downturn, it provides ample evidence that the crisis in the power industry significantly contributes to job loss and siphons capital from other productive sectors of the economy. For example, the author explains that privatized energy companies often cut payrolls in order to boost bottom-line profits. Ms. Beder also shows how obscene profits earned by a few large corporations such as Enron often act as a drag on local economies. The leading example of course is California, where escalating prices forced many businesses to shut down. Moreover, the payments that the state was forced to make to greedy suppliers during the energy crisis easily exceeds the state's current budget deficit, causing hardship for many.<br />Interestingly, \\"Power Play\\" was completed prior to the 2003 blackout in the U.S. and Canada. This unfortunate event validates Ms. Beder's work. The author points out that the dynamics of an unregulated market and the quest for instant profits provides a disincentive for producers to maintain equipment and transmission lines, resulting in more frequent failures and service disruptions. Ms. Beder goes on to point out that the expense and risk associated with added capacity is increasingly borne by the public even while profits accrue to private interests; this assertion also appears to have been prescient, as witnessed by the huge subsidies that the U.S. government has recently proposed to pay for upgrades to the country's electric grid for the benefit of many privately-held energy producers.<br />By cutting through the smokescreen of self-serving corporate propaganda, \\"Power Play\\" serves as a wakeup call for citizens everywhere. It helps us understand how we might be able to reverse this trend for the better before more damage is inflicted on us all.ven while profits accrue to private interests; this assertion also appears to have been prescient, as witnessed by the huge subsidies that the U.S. government has recently proposed to pay for upgrades to the country's electric grid for the benefit of many privately-held energy producers.<br />By cutting through the smokescreen of self-serving corporate propaganda, \\"Power Play\\" serves as a wakeup call for citizens everywhere.

It holds lessons about U.S. imperialism and the demonization of its supposed enemies -- lessons that, unfortunately, appear to have been largely overlooked by the American public. Indeed, the template for the exercise of U.S. power by the elder Bush against Noriega in Panama as described in this book seems to have been knowingly employed by the younger Bush against Saddam in Iraq.<br /><br />Given the demonization of Noriega in the U.S. media, one may be surprised but nonetheless impressed with Noriega's personal values as they are expressed in this book. Noriega's support of policies that began with the Torrijos administration on raising living standards among the nation's poor seems to be sincere; no doubt this is connected with his Catholic faith and his familiarity with the Bible, which is quoted in several places in the book. Noriega also writes fondly about his career in the Panamanian military and the honor, discipline and professionalism associated with this career and the duties he performed on behalf of his country. Overall, while Noriega does not appear to be a saint he does seem to be a healthy, balanced and moral person.<br /><br />I think that Noriega's contention that he became a marked man due to his insistence on Panamanian soveriegnty is credible. To his credit, Noriega never bought into Cold War ideology, choosing instead to provide safe haven for political refugees of all stripes and to open up channels of communication with Fidel Castro and others. Yet despite years of friendly relations with the U.S. and cooperation with the CIA, his decision to open talks with the Japanese about a new canal combined with his refusal to cooperate with Ollie North's illegal &#34;contra&#34; war in Nicaragua proved to be too much for the White House.<br /><br />If Noriega ever did commit a crime that could possibly justify a full-scale invasion, it is also true that the drug conviction against him is highly suspect. The chapters that discuss the dirty dealings with Colombian drug cartels in securing the conviction is very disturbing. On the other hand, the fact that drug shipments increased in the absence of Noriega provides credence to the author's contention that the Panamanian Defense Forces cooperated in the war on drugs during Noriega's tenure.<br /><br />Last but certainly not least, the horrible consequences of the war on the innocent Panamanian people are discussed. Clearly, it was unneccesary to use such overwhelming force against a peaceful country in the midst of its Christmas celebrations. Noriega's blistering comments about the leading protagonists of the war -- including Colin Powell and George Bush Sr. -- may cause consternation among some Americans; but on balance the General's narrative is remarkably restrained. Indeed, the book is a cautionary tale of powerlessness and how a small nation and its leaders have few options available once regime change has been deemed desirable by the U.S. government. The sad part, of course, is that thousands of innocent civilians had to pay for these policies with their lives (not to mention the countless others who have been left with the shattered remains of their bombed-out communities).<br /><br />In my view, recent events in Iraq, Venezuela, Colombia and elsewhere makes it more important than ever for Americans to gain greater perspective on the consequences of U.S. foreign policy. To that end, &#34;America's Prisoner&#34; is a superbly readable, provocative and informative book that deserves a wide audience.

The new edition from 2003 features a Preface that was written just prior to the U.S. invasion of Iraq. In my view, Dr. Zinn's essays are helpful in understanding many of the forces that have influenced international events today.<br />A theme that runs through most of the essays pertains to the contradictions of U.S. rhetoric and policy. While the U.S. consistently espouses democratic principles, Dr. Zinn asserts that the country often acts in a Machiavellian manner in order to protect deeply embedded corporate and elitist privileges. However, Dr. Zinn is most interested in highlighting some of the individuals and organizations who have spoken truth to power and have struggled to keep democracy alive. The author reminds us about forgotten heroes from the past -- such as the laborers from the Colorado coal strike of 1913-1914 -- and helps us appreciate the hard-fought victories that were won against significant opposition from capital and government.<br />Dr. Zinn's personal experiences as a World War II airman and as an organizer during the Civil Rights struggles of the 1960s adds vibrancy to the narrative; you soon realize that the author is an intelligent person who has had meaningful first-hand interactions with some of the important historical events of the 20th century. Dr. Zinn helps the reader understand that freedom and democracy depend more on an informed and active citizenry than on the government, whose elitist political class more often represent their own self-interests than those of the people.<br />One of my favorite chapters was Dr. Zinn's refutation of the idea of a just war. The author contends that the most damaging popular legacy of WW II is that the U.S. can and should use its military superiority to achieve political and economic objectives whenever it is convenient to do so.

As such, the book is a sobering story of deeply-entrenched corporate interests and the trampling of consumer rights.<br />Ms. Hart is an experienced journalist who has done an excellent job documenting the activities of the biotech industry and its opponents. The author shows that much of the so-called debate that has played out in the media has been mostly pro-industry propaganda and public relations, with most Americans remaining blissfully unaware of the risks they may be taking by eating GE food products. This contrasts sharply with Europe, Japan and elsewhere, where the public has prevailed upon their representatives to enact labeling laws and keep most biotech food out of their countries.<br />Ms. Hart discusses scientific studies that are critical of GE products to make the case that more study is needed before approval is granted. The protestations from the biotech industry that these studies represent &quot;junk science&quot; are beside the point. It is not unreasonable to demand that radical food products -- such as potatoes and corn that produce their own pesticides -- are thoroughly tested before being released into the environment; this would seem especially true when one considers that there is absolutely no nutritional benefit for the consumers who ingest these products. But of course a strict regime of testing does not serve the interests of capital, which must recoup its investment and earn profits as quickly as possible. Hence the pressure on U.S. government agencies filled with powerful ex-industry executives to hastily approve these dubious products for sale.<br />Ms. Hart provides abundant evidence that consumers and environmentalists should be very, very afraid of the captains of biotech and their products; their penchant for mischief could hardly be imagined by the most talented writers of fiction. For example, Monsanto's aborted &quot;terminator&quot; seed project threatened to introduce crops that would produce sterile seeds in a corporate scheme that would have made the world almost totally dependent on its products for the maintenance of the food supply. Another example is &quot;bio-pharming&quot;, which is the insane idea of using food crops to grow pharmaceutical products in an open-air environment. Unfortunately, bio-pharming could result in cross-pollination with native plants and might ultimately ruin staples that humanity has depended on for thousands of years. Ms. Hart makes it clear that such risks are totally unnecessary and deserves much greater attention from the public if we are to avert disaster in the future.<br />On the positive side, the book helps us understand that the new science of genomics might render GE techniques obsolete, providing researchers with tools that merely enhance age-old plant breeding practices and deliver on the promise of more healthy and nutritious foods. Let's hope that this is the case. But in the meantime, the evidence presented in this book suggests that GE products should be labeled and the industry regulated much more closely than it is today, if not banned outright.<br />I strongly encourage everyone to read this book.alented writers of fiction.

The authors are seasoned media critics who are skilled at deconstructing propaganda and unearthing the motives that drive U.S. policy in the Middle East. Like in the movie 'Wizard of Oz', we realize that almost everything we have been told by the political leaders who have been hiding behind the proverbial curtain of PR spin has been patently untrue.<br />Rampton and Stauber begin the book by discussing the role U.S. propaganda has played in the Middle East from the post-WW II era to today. The authors contend that America's self-professed image of promoting democracy has clashed severely with the reality of its support for petty dictators and monarchs who, in return for U.S. support, ensured a steady supply of oil. The authors insist that this is the reason why the post-9/11 &quot;branding&quot; campaign to favorably influence Arabic opinion of America failed miserably.<br />On the other hand, selling the Iraq war to the American public has been much more successful. The authors discuss the role that PR professionals, the CIA and conservative groups played in the anti-Saddam media blitz that was heaped upon the U.S. citizenry. Perhaps not surprisingly, we learn that many of these players could profit handsomely when Iraq's oil reserves become privatized.<br />Rampton and Stauber examine the increasingly close relationship between the U.S. military and the media. The authors debunk the infamous 'incubator babies' story from the Gulf War era but show how such misinformation can be used to successfully influence public opinion. Likewise, claims that a Saddam-Al Qaeda connection may exist and that Saddam may possess weapons of mass destruction were known to be false, but the repetition of these lies by authority figures implied truth and persuaded many people of their validity.<br />In possibly the most important section of the book, Rampton and Stauber remind us that most of the terrorists involved in the 9/11 attacks were Saudi Arabian. The authors contend that deep financial ties between the Bush administration and Saudi Arabia has compromised U.S. response to the terror crisis. We learn that the Kingdom funds anti-American Wahhabism in order to channel street-level resentment of elitist privlege away from the Saudi monarchy and towards the U.S. government. This duplicity is deeply disturbing and is a sad testament to how badly American foreign policy has been compromised as a result of its selling out to big oil.<br />The authors go on to discuss the use of doublespeak, fear and the corporate ownership of media in shaping public discourse. Interestingly, we discover that people who watch TV the most actually know less about important topics than others. No doubt this phenomenon has something to do with the deployment of Pentagon &quot;combat camera&quot; crews and &quot;embedded&quot; TV reporters who overwhelmingly presented a pro-U.S. bias with little critical context or analysis. On the other hand, images played to foreign audiences more often depicted the brutal realities of war: the dead and injured Iraqi people, their devastated homeland, and the contradictions of U.S. policy.<br />In the end, &quot;Weapons of Mass Deception&quot; warns us about the dangers posed to democracy when leaders and citizens believe their own propaganda.

Mr. Sarkar was born and educated in India and wrote the book while residing in Germany, where he has been active in the Green Party and related political and environmental movements for many years. The author's education, work and multi-cultural life experiences combine to produce a nuanced, thoughtful and mature work that should intrigue readers interested in political theory and the environment.<br />Mr. Sarkar believes that the ecology movement must recognize that socialism, not capitalism, offers the best hope for society to realize the state of &quot;biocentric equality&quot; that will be needed to secure human rights and stabilize the environment. Central to the author's analysis is the &quot;limits to growth&quot; paradigm espoused by Green Economics thinkers such as Herman Daly, which posits that economic growth achieved through increasing natural resources consumption can not continue indefinitely. But the author goes well beyond Daly and his peers by insisting that a steady state economy (SSE) can not succeed in a free market capitalist system; rather, it can only be viable in the context of socialism.<br />Mr. Sarkar does not toss the word &quot;socialism&quot; around lightly. In fact, he devotes two chapters extensively studying why socialism failed in the USSR. In short, Mr. Sarkar posits that environmental constraints combined with widespread moral degeneration led to a crisis that could not be resolved by the USSR's privileged political/bureaucratic class. While many might argue that the USSR failed on a number of other levels as well, I found the author's analysis credible and well-supported by the evidence. Importantly, the analysis provides several take-aways that are later incorporated into the author's proposed eco-socialist theory, such as the importance of morals to the building and maintenance of a well-functioning society.<br />Mr. Sarkar examines the natural resource base that the present world economy depends upon in order to ascertain if new technologies might be able to offer us hope in overcoming scarcity. The author surveys various energy sources and technologies to provide detailed answers to this question. He also critiques the fashionable view that the contemporary &quot;dematerialized&quot; information society is less environmentally destructive than yesterday's industrial society. Mr. Sarkar's thoughts that follow from this discussion about what must be done in the face of the world's dwindling stock of natural resources might appear to some to be commonsense but are nonetheless well worth reading. Indeed, the author's candor is refreshing and welcome, especially when compared with the media's usual message of consumerism without end.<br />Mr. Sarkar presents his vision of how an eco-socialist society might succeed and discusses the notion of progress in the final two chapters of the book. The author believes that eco-socialism can rightly fuse the moral strengths of socialism with the pragamtism of the ecology movement to create a society that is free from greed, war, exploitation and rascism. This is achieved by embracing policies that are widely acknowledged in Leftist circles, including: full employment, women's rights, pay equity, limits on private enterprise, greater emphasis on the local production of goods and services, increased democratic participation, and so on. But the author also makes a very strong argument for controversial measures such as the rationing of consumer goods, strict controls on population growth, and more. Mr. Sarkar's justification is that the inconveniences created for some will be more than offset by the creation of a harmonious, peaceful and stable planet for all.<br />As wars around the world intensify due to struggles over increasingly scarce resources such as oil, Mr. Sarkar's opinion that humanity must eventually choose &quot;either eco-socialism or barbarism&quot; may well be true. To that end, I highly recommend this outstanding book to those who might be interested in reading thought-provoking ideas from an uniquely visionary, compassionate and intelligent author.or barbarism&quot; may well be true.

The book is somewhat unusual in that it is the collaborative product of three authors, but the writing seems to blend perfectly and makes for a consistent and high-quality read. The end product is an accessible and entertaining book that could serve to introduce a wide audience to critical postmodern analysis.<br />Nick Dyer-Witheford of \\"Cyber-Marx\\" fame is one of the authors. Mr. Dyer-Witheford's influence is discernable in at least several sections where the post-Marxist themes of corporate control versus freedom that are evident in \\"Cyber-Marx\\" are used to very good effect. First, he deflates the wildly optimistic claims of techno-utopians such as Alvin Toffler, reminding us that technology remains in service to corporate profits and therefore narrows and limits the possibility of \\"choice, interactivity and empowerment\\" that digital games purportedly offer. Second, Mr. Dyer-Witheford points to piracy and hacking as evidence that freedom from corporate control and a return to \\"play\\" in its purest sense may yet remain possible.<br />The authors contend that video games are worthy of serious study because they represent the \\"ideal-type\\" postmodern commodity. So whereas the automobile is closely associated with the \\"industrial capitalism\\" of the Fordist era, the video game embodies the \\"information capitalism\\" of today's \\"perpetual innovation\\" society.<br />The ideal-type commodity does not mean that it avoids crisis, however. The authors posit that the accelerating \\"circuits\\" of technology, culture and marketing that drive postmodern society in general and the video game business in particular \\"can be broken or come into contradiction\\" in numerous ways. The authors go on to critique each of these three circuits and produce many pages of very thoughtful analysis.<br />For example, an interesting aspect of the industry that is often overlooked is manufacturing and the international division of labor. Electronic game equipment is often produced by proletariat labor in the poor countries of the South for the benefit of relatively wealthy consumers in the North. The authors point out that the game industry, like most capitalist enterprises that exploit the so-called free trade system in search of higher profits, will find it difficult to develop new markets for its products until it is willing to pay its third-world factory workers enough money to stimulate demand. In fact, the authors state that corporate managers should not be too surprised when intellectual property gets pirated by people who feel that they have been cheated by the economic system.<br />But probably the most stinging criticism concerns the close connection of games with Cold War research and development. The \\"militarized masculinity\\" that characterizes so many games originated here and has been perpetuated by corporate marketing in pursuit of profits. But the authors point out that if the industry fails to find successful alternative game genres and graphic violence continues to escalate, future interest in gaming may be jeopardized even as the potential damage to children exposed to such psychic intensity remains unknown.<br />In short, \\"Digital Play\\" is highly recommended to everyone interested in deconstructing the multi-faceted and increasingly fantastical world that has been brought to us by the \\"military and entertainment\\" complex.erlooked is manufacturing and the international division of labor.

Kim Moody's \\"Workers in a Lean World\\" is a scholarly but highly readable critique of the contemporary labor movement and its struggle with capital. The author discusses numerous instances from around the world where employees have resisted management to support his contention that today's workers movement remains a potent historical force. In fact, the author points to new forms of worker organization to posit that the working class may be closer to throwing off the mantle of capitalist rule than one might suspect.<br />Mr. Moody is a labor researcher and activist who displays a great deal of knowledge and passion for the subject. He is the director of 'Labor Notes', an organization that publishes and sponsors conferences for labor leaders. The book benefits from the author's solid scholarship and case studies shared by real-life contacts with people who are active in making history today. Rarely is labor's side of the story told as intelligently, persuasively and compellingly as it is here.<br />Mr. Moody presents an unique analysis of postmodern industrialization. Like others, he points to the crisis of accumulation in the mid-1970s as a catalyst for change. Lean production utilizes information technology, cross-border production chains, and deskilled labor in an attempt to restore corporate profitability. But at this point, the author departs from most other analysts in a number of ways.<br />Mr. Moody challenges postmodern theorists by demonstrating that material production remains at the heart of capitalism. Citing a wealth of statistics, the author explains that the Fordist model remains vital and Taylorism is integral to the success of lean production. We are reminded of the age-old reality that labor's gain is management's loss; but while acknowledging that many jobs have been recently transferred overseas to low-wage countries, the author contends that it is not as easy for companies to relocate production as one might think. In fact, most job losses in recent years have been attributable to the implementation of computer technology. Rather, corporate PR and the threat of relocation is most often used by management to wring concessions from a largely insecure workforce that has become disoriented in the face of these rapid changes.<br />One particular powerful aspect of Mr. Moody's analysis pertained to his blistering critique of Human Resources Management (HRM), a \\"propagandistic\\" ideology full of \\"hype about worker autonomy and empowerment\\" (pg. 89). HRM has been successfully used by many companies to create a more easily exploitable workforce. In general, HRM coerces workers to share information with management, which all too often leads to speed-up and job loading at individual factories. Such knowlege then quickly spreads throughout the industry as examples of these so-called \\"best practices\\" are shared in management circles. But the underpaid, deskilled and overstressed workforce that ultimately results from an HRM project exposes the inherently lopsided nature of the labor/management relationship.<br />Mr. Moody compares and contrasts the union movement in the industrialized North with the newly-industrialized South. The author finds that many unions in the North (the U.S., Europe and Japan) have been coopted by management and consequently have lost much of their effectiveness. In contrast, the author highlights the successes of some of the more dynamic unions in the South (Brazil, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan and elsewhere) to contend that a form of social-movement unionism that combines political and economic goals may help secure a better future for the working class as a whole. Importantly, the author believes that the same cross-border production chains that enable globalization to flourish must be used by unions in the North and the South to share ideas, coordinate actions and achieve shared goals. While one may not be as optimistic as the author that such a coordinated worker campaign might gain theupper hand anytime soon, the strength of the author's work is such that one can clearly see the contours of the movement beginning to form and imagine that its eventual success may certainly be within the realm of possibility.<br />In short, \\"Workers in a Lean World\\" is a thoughtful book that is full of insight, sophisticated analysis and forward-thinking ideas about creating a more just and egalitarian society. Highly recommended.e upper hand anytime soon, the strength of the author's work is such that one can clearly see the contours of the movement beginning to form and imagine that its eventual success may certainly be within the realm of possibility.<br />In short, \\"Workers in a Lean World\\" is a thoughtful book that is full of insight, sophisticated analysis and forward-thinking ideas about creating a more just and egalitarian society.

Wise's \\"Drawing the Line\\" presents a compelling argument for recognizing the rights of \\"nonhuman\\" animals. As a lawyer who has taught at Harvard and has championed animal rights for over twenty years, Mr. Wise directs our attention in this book to some of the recent scientific studies pertaining to animal intelligence. The evidence strongly suggests that at least some species qualify for dignity rights and other legal protections.<br />Mr. Wise provides introductory chapters that succinctly defines the struggle for animal rights. The author compares the historic practice of slavery with today's plight of nonhuman animals. Deep-rooted socioeconomic practices conspired to keep slavery alive for most of human history; today, animal slavery is fueled by longstanding cultural and economic forces. Consequently Mr. Wise approaches the daunting task of animal liberation with eyes wide open. He has written this book as a strategic move to further our understanding and with the hope of advancing the struggle.<br />To that end, I would have to say that Mr. Wise has succeeded brilliantly. The author employs a sound methodology to persuade us of the merits of his case. Mr. Wise rank-orders the intelligence of nonhuman animals by utilizing Piaget's well-known theories pertaining to the study of early childhood development. Consequently most of the chapters in the book are devoted to the study of specific animals (such as Koko the gorilla) who might represent the innate abilities of their respective species. You will be intrigued with how Mr. Wise utilizes Piagetian measures such as mirror self-recognition tests in order to compare animal performances with human intelligence.<br />I think that nearly everyone who reads this book with an open mind will be persuaded that at least a few species do indeed display the characteristics of \\"practical autonomy\\" that should assure them of rights under the law. Mr. Wise visits with leading researchers to demonstrate the mental acuities of specific animals; in many cases, we come to appreciate the unique personalities of these remarkable animals. The power of Mr. Wise's writing is such that the notion of subjecting these animals to cruel scientific experiments and the like seems unthinkable, and liberation suddenly appears to be a quite reasonable and humane thing to do.<br />In short, I highly recommend this compassionate, original and thought-provoking book to everyone who cares about animals. While the legal system may not yet have recognized the validity of Mr. Wise' argument, this book will no doubt help the good lawyer secure a favorable ruling in the court of public opinion.ties of specific animals; in many cases, we come to appreciate the unique personalities of these remarkable animals.

Mr. Schlosser does not attempt a comprehensive examination -- notably absent are software piracy, music downloading, prostitution, offshore banking and gambling --but appears instead to have selected three topics that, presumably, might help sell copies for his publisher. (Such are the perils, apparently, of having to follow up the classic \\"Fast Food Nation\\".)<br />The first section is dedicated to illegal drugs. Mr. Schlosser does a very good job savaging the contradictions of legal and illegal drug policies in this country. In only 64 pages, the author provides background, statistics and case studies that make for very compelling reading. His conclusions are consistent with what most reformers have been arguing for some time. The draconian laws and failed policies of the so-called 'War on Drugs' are so out of step with mainstream American thought and practice that Mr. Schlosser's sly rewrite of a John Lennon anthem resonates with power: \\"this war is over, if you want it.\\" This devastating critique was my favorite of the three essays, by far.<br />The second section on illegal labor is a scant 34 pages long. It is focused on the plight of strawberry pickers in California. Mr. Schlosser's keen powers of observation and solid research methodology combine to produce a scathing critique of the inhumane conditions that many migrant farmworkers endure. But by focusing on such a thin slice of the American labor market, it may be difficult to judge the validity of the author's generalized recommendations about rectifying labor abuses nationwide.<br />Personally, I was disappointed that the third section on the porn industry was as lengthy as the other two combined. The story was mostly a history lesson and biography centered around Reuben Sturman, who the author shows was primarily responsible for growing the porn industry through most of the post World War II era and who tirelessly defended it against its enemies. But while Mr. Schlosser's article makes it clear that porn was officially repressed for many years in the U.S., today that no longer seems to be the case. Consequently it doesn't seem to provide much support for the author's theme of the contemporary state of the underground economy, although the story was certainly interesting and extremely well-written.<br />In the end, one wishes that Mr. Schlosser had been able to fully develop these stories into three separate books. The stature that the author has gained as a result of \\"Fast Food Nation\\" guarantees that his views have power, but I'm afraid that diluting the subject matter probably takes away some of the punch. That's too bad, because in my view the drug laws and the labor laws, in particular, badly need reform.<br />Here's hoping that Mr. Schlosser's publisher gives this talented writer the opportunity to produce another gem on par with \\"Fast Food Nation\\" the next time around. But in the meantime, Mr. Schlosser's fans can get a quick fix by reading this entertaining but slighly disappointing book.t against its enemies.

Eleven of Ms. Brysk's colleagues from academia have contributed outstanding original research to this book. Most of the authors are specialists in political science, women's studies, international law and related fields. The focus is on how human rights may become more or less secure as a result of globalization. The end result is a scholarly analysis of the contradictions of globalization that no doubt will give thoughtful readers much to consider.<br />The book is well-structured. Ms. Brysk contributes introductory and concluding essays that provides excellent context and analysis. In between, the main content is divided into four sections containing three articles each (except for the first section on \\"Citizenship\\" which has only two articles). There is also a forty-page bibliography for those who want to access the reference material.<br />I found the first section on \\"Citizenship\\" to be one of the best in the book. Kristen Hill Maher argues in the first essay that the demand for cheap labor in the U.S. and Europe fosters a kind of \\"neocolonialism\\" that has negative implications for the rights of \\"illegal\\" workers, their families, and society. The second article by Amalia Lucia Cabezas addresses the topic of sex tourism in the Dominican Republic. The essay descends from a high-level perspective of corporate domination of trade, economics and the tourist industry down to the realities of the exploited male and female workers who often turn to sex to augment their meager incomes. Interestingly, Ms. Cabezas shows how resourcefulness has enabled these workers to become empowered in the face of long-standing cultural prejudices and gaining respect and upward mobility for a few.<br />The second section on the topic of \\"Commodification\\" discusses global markets. The failures of \\"globalization from above\\" are criticized by Richard Falk, who contends that a more humane form of capitalism that benefits people can only come about by harnessing democratic forces to create a \\"globalization from below.\\" One of the many discoveries from Wesley T. Milner's statistical study is that increased economic freedom leads to an increase in inequality and hence has a negative effect on \\"subsistence rights\\" for people in poor countries. And Raul C. Pangalangan believes that international labor standards are needed to combat the sweatshop conditions that are conspicuous in nations that are managed by corrupt rulers who have effectively sold-out for private gain.<br />The third section addresses \\"Communication\\". Shane Weyker discusses how the Internet and other forms of electronic communications have aided some struggles (such as the Zapatistas in southern Mexico) but is also frequently used by the powerful for the purposes of surveillance and disinformation. Clifford Bob studies the dynamics that might cause some groups to receive favorable coverage (such as Ken Saro-Wiwa and the Ogoni tribe's conflict with Shell Corporation in Nigeria) and others to go almost unnoticed. James N. Rosenau's article is a highly specialized piece of research that assesses the impact of globalization on security rights, economic rights, cultural rights and political rights.<br />The fourth section is on the subject of \\"Cooperation.\\" Jonathan Fox's study of the World Bank's Inspection Panel discusses the panel's mixed record of success but nevertheless argues that its existence is testimony to the power of people to effect institutional change. Wayne Sandholtz shows that cross-border military interventions continue to be justified on \\"security\\" concerns (not humanitarian), although there is hope that international law might soon recognize humanitarianism as a just cause. Jack Donnelly's \\"Human Rights, Globalizing Flows, and State Power\\" was especially appealing. Mr. Donnelly takes the almost unfashionable position of reasserting the value of the nation-state. The current trend of allowing multinational corporations to undermine the social fabric is effectively impoverishing the workers and polarizing class relations. While recognizing past abuses of state power, the author argues that only the state has the means to redistribute wealth in a manner that ensures human rights and the long-term viability of the society.<br />In short, this book should intrigue graduate students, professionals and others who have a keen interest in human rights. It is full of nuanced discussions written by some of the leading subject matter experts and will challenge and stimulate demanding readers.

By sympathizing with the struggles of the lower and middle classes against their increasing exploitation by the powerful, the book serves as a bottom-up indictment of violent global capitalism. Ms. Roy suggests that war is merely the most extreme manifestation of an elitist capitalist system that is sustained by subsuming all available land, labor and resources to its own ends. The result is a scathing and compelling critique of capitalism and politics as practiced in both the U.S. and her native India.<br />Ms. Roy initially made her mark as a novelist, and her gift for prose is turned to very good use here. In an era when the corporate media routinely treats moral issues in an ambiguous manner, the author's convictions seem to be almost revelatory. For example, when discussing the standoff between India and Pakistan over the contentious issue of Kashmir, she writes, \\"Why do we tolerate the men who use nuclear weapons to blackmail the entire human race?\\" Why, indeed?<br />While Ms. Roy minces no words about the growth of fascism in India, she credits President George W. Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair with creating \\"a congenial international atmosphere\\" for fascism to take root. This is a world where the U.S. uses its military might to support its multinational corporate empire. Destroying countries that harbor terrorists is only its most obvious and visible form. Ms. Roy believes that it is the mistreatment of the poor by the powerful -- e.g., the lack of respect for human rights; the privatization of public resources; the monopolization of \\"free\\" speech by media corporations; and so on -- that ultimately defines the empire and, conversely, the struggle that must ensue to confront and supplant it.<br />I give this book the highest possible rating and highly recommend it to anyone who might be struggling to understand the increasingly violent world we are inhabiting.	2003-04-29

Mr. Kwong effectively connects his study of labor struggles within the illegal Chinese immigrant community to outside macroeconomic forces. It is the author's contention that the exploitation of illegal workers is key to understanding the restructuring of capital/labor relations within the U.S. in the postindustrial era.<br />Mr. Kwong is a resident of New York and has close ties to the Chinese community. His solid academic scholarship combines with real-world activism to present a contemporary assessment of illegal Chinese labor. Much of the book is dedicated to then current events (early to mid 1990s), such as the well-known Golden Adventure incident and lesser-known strikes against Chinese-owned businesses, among many others. The author convincingly supplants the mainstream's stereotypical image of docile and complacent Chinese labor with a more complex and disturbing picture of a frightened, indebted and exploited workforce that is barely able to subsist on the fringes of society.<br />Mr. Kwong's mastery of Chinese-American history is evident throughout the book. He provides the reader with useful background material on a number of relevant events, from the Chinese Labor Exclusion Act of 1882 to the enlistment of Chinese seamen in World War II. The author helps us understand the cultural and economic factors that have prompted many Chinese-Americans to develop thriving but insular and crime-ridden Chinatowns in major cities across the U.S.<br />The failures of government policy and organized labor are critiqued at length. Mr. Kwong shows how capitalism has effectively co-opted the democratic institutions in this country that are supposed to help the working class. For example, the government's lack of enforcement of labor laws (including, of course, immigration policy) and the union movement's out-of-touch leadership combined with close ties to corporate management are cited as critical factors that explain why labor laws are routinely violated.<br />Importantly, the author reasserts the dignity of human labor, suggesting that the defense of workers' rights should not come at the risk of deportation. In fact, it is this vulnerability that allows unscrupulous employers to exploit workers with impunity. The resulting worker fear and insecurity has been a crucial factor in helping capital depress wages among all workers, Mr. Kwong explains.<br />In short, Mr. Kwong's important book does much to explain why the American dream is increasingly becoming a nightmare for the working class in general and particularly among illegal Chinese-Americans. But the author also suggests that a reinvigorated labor movement dedicated to grass-roots democracy can point the way to a better future. I highly recommend this book to readers interested in learning more about labor relations and the Chinese-American struggle.nagement are cited as critical factors that explain why labor laws are routinely violated.<br />Importantly, the author reasserts the dignity of human labor, suggesting that the defense of workers' rights should not come at the risk of deportation.

The author provides background on U.S.-Colombian relations and an overview of Colombian society to help the reader contextualize recent events. While violence in Colombia is rooted in that country's stratified social relations, it is America's \\"War on Drugs\\" that now might rip apart what little remains of Colombia's civil society.<br />Professor Crandall teaches Political Science at Davidson College. Crandall writes in a concise and scholarly manner, and his expertise on the subject matter is readily apparent. The author uses solid research; the numerous footnotes include a number of first-person interviews with knowledgeable sources as well as author translations of Spanish-language sources. The author's arguments are convincing and his conclusions are air-tight as they appear to be based on a rational evaluation of the evidence.<br />Principally, Crandall argues that Colombian-U.S. relations changed from a mutually-agreeable anti-Communist philosophy to a \\"narcotized\\" orientation by the mid 1980s. The narcotized state of affairs, Crandall suggests, is driven by America's multiple addictions; this includes of course the widespread consumption of illicit substances among its population and a congress dependent on defense industry dollars. (To this I might also suggest a peculiarly American need to rationalize its foreign policies in a moralistic manner.)<br />Perhaps not surprisingly, recent Colombian administrations have had mixed reactions to U.S. policies. Crandall writes that in fact our efforts have only succeeded in undermining Colombia's central government at the same moment when narco-trafficers, paramilitary groups, and guerilla fighters have exploited fear and uncertainty among the populace in order to gain strength. One hopes that Crandall's plea for U.S. policy makers to learn \\"from past mistakes\\" and instead implement policies that address Colombia's core socio-economic needs is heeded soon.<br />With so much of today's news reporting obsessed with other regions of the world, I strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about the decades-long war that America has been waging in Colombia.ead implement policies that address Colombia's core socio-economic needs is heeded soon.<br />With so much of today's news reporting obsessed with other regions of the world, I strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about the decades-long war that America has been waging in Colombia.	2003-04-13

The over 33 authors who contributed to this book examine the myriad social, economic and political consequences of our current drug policies. Many of these writers present evidence contending that harm reduction would be far more effective than the punitive strategy our country has favored since Richard Nixon launched the modern drug war in 1968.<br />The individual articles offer information that might prove very helpful to activists fighting for commonsense policies. Indeed, the \\"Busted\\" project itself might represent a personal scrapbook of press clippings collected by Mr. Gray, who chairs just such an organization. Unfortunately, the overly loose organization of material constitutes the book's core weakness.<br />To begin with, Mr. Gray delivers a scant six-page Introduction for this 280-page book. Although the book is organized into seven sections that are meant to group the articles along themes such as \\"The View From the Fortieth Floor\\", we are given no guidance from Mr. Gray as to what we might expect to learn from these sections. Worse, the editor makes little attempt to contextualize these issues nor does he present any analysis of the drug law reform movement with respect to real world policy. On the plus side, Mr. Gray admirably provides a helpful Resouces section at the end of the book, but overall one suspects that this ambitious collection badly needs and deserves a better effort from its editor.<br />Second, the articles themselves did not always display the characteristics of \\"consistently high\\" proofreading, much less writing. Several of the stories were riddled with punctuation and spelling mistakes that make for very distracted reading; it was almost as if a few of the articles were copied from webpages and pasted into the manuscript without anyone bothering to see if the formatting might have been corrupted during the process. One hopes that these easily correctable problems will be fixed before future editions of the book are printed.<br />Third, the articles, while individually quite good, do tend to overlap and don't always seem to fall in the right sections of the book. For example, I almost lost count of the number of times I had to read about how a recent Washington, D.C. medical marijuana referendum was approved by the voters but subsequently rejected by the federal government. And a lengthy story about a crime-busting federal drug informant was included in the section \\"South of the Border\\" but, oddly, not in the section dedicated to \\"Criminal Justice.\\" The time span of these stories does not help either; some articles date back as far as 1990, which seems odd for a book published in 2002 that is purported to represent current thinking on the subject. The net effect of all this is that it makes it difficult to read the book end-to-end without feeling disoriented; one quickly gets the sense that a logical progression to the arguments might never materialize, and in fact they do not.<br />Fourth, the reading experience is discontinuous due to the authors' wide variety of styles, tones and subject matter. You get parts investigative journalism, scholarly analysis, medical research, street reporting and more. One minute you might read an article laced with obscenities; the next you are contemplating the nuanced articulations of William F. Buckley, Jr. And in the Noriega interview, you are confounded by the seemingly endless series of conspiracy theory questions a paranoid Oliver Stone floats like so many trial balloons for a prospective Hollywood screenplay. Overall, the juxtaposition of all these stories is interesting, but it seems a little bizarre too.<br />In my view, you can get a good (but not great) buzz from this book. It has the merit of assembling a pastiche of stories for researchers or others who might not want todo a Google search on the topic, but in my view it also misses a golden opportunity to provide some badly needed analysis on the very important subject of drug prohibition.o do a Google search on the topic, but in my view it also misses a golden opportunity to provide some badly needed analysis on the very important subject of drug prohibition.	2003-03-31

Foster guides the reader through a fascinating look at Marx's personal intellectual development and the various thinkers who influenced him. The author reveals a Marx who was keenly aware of capital's strategy to alienate labor from nature. Foster also makes clear that Marx worked assiduously to develop a theory that might reconnect dehumanized labor with its degraded environment in hopes of creating a better, more sustainable world.<br />Indeed, Foster's book is an interesting study of intellectual history, with an emphasis on the debates that raged during Marx's lifespan in the 19th century. The ideas and discoveries of Darwin, Engels, Epicurus, Hegel, Malthus, Proudhon, and others are discussed at length. Foster presents a Marx who was clearly at the vanguard of progressive thought in his era and gives us considerable insight into how Marx  created his materialist theory of history. We also understand why Marx privileged the environment but explicitly rejected the fashionable teleological and racist arguments of his time.<br />In particular, I found the discussion concerning Epicurus to be fascinating. Epicurus was an ancient Greek philosopher who had a profound influence on the Enlightenment and was the subject of Marx's doctoral dissertation. Foster tells us that Marx's unconventional interpretations have been confirmed by recent archaeological discoveries, although at the time Marx had been working from a small number of extant fragments of Epicurus' writings. In addition to explaining to the reader why Epicurus' ideas are important, Foster deepens our appreciation for Marx, whose intellectual capabilities were evident even at a fairly young age.<br />In the Epilogue, Foster shows how Marx's ecology fell out of the loop, a victim to Soviet ideology, Stalinist purges and other historical forces. But he shows how snippets of Marx's environmental thought has influenced scholars and activists throughout the 20th century. In fact, Foster suggests that Marx has been vindicated by some within the contemporary environmental movement. For example, Rachel Carson's work connecting corporate power with environmental and social degradation recalls (unconsciously?) Marx's work regarding the dialectic of nature and science. But with this book, Foster has effectively redrawn the circle, solidly connecting Marxist theory with the environment. Foster helps us understand that social justice and ecological sustainability are core Marxist values that can guide and inspire activists who are looking for solutions to today's environmental crisis.<br /><br />In short, I strongly recommend this book for readers who are interested in intellectual history and/or eco-socialist theory, and congratulate Foster for an outstanding piece of research.onmental thought has influenced scholars and activists throughout the 20th century.

US	52736752	RIREXFVO7CDS0	0738206644	473920452	Branded: The Buying And Selling Of Teenagers	Books	5	53	58	N	Y	"Corporate pedophilia" and your children	Alissa Quart's \\"Branded\\" explores how America's youth are increasingly subjected to sophisticated but ultimately predatory forms of corporate marketing and branding. While the social reproduction of labor has been defined by capitalist requirements for many years, Ms. Quart amply demonstrates that the co-optation of today's youth has deepened and intensified. For many, the immersion in consumerism is so all-encompassing that it threatens to corrupt and corrode their mental self-images and possibly inhibit their ability to function as enlightened citizens.<br />Ms. Quart shows that the marketing tactics used are often invasive and unscrupulous, amounting to a sort of \\"corporate pedophilia\\" whose aim is to grow the corporate bottom line at the expense of childhood itself. Indeed, the author explains that whole classes of products (such as sexually-provocative undergarments designed for pre-teen girls) are unapologetically marketed to ever-younger children, thereby accelerating the pace at which children develop, perceive and interact with their surroundings. Ms. Quart blasts the justifications used by marketers to defend such indefensible actions and alerts us to the moral vacuousness that lies at the heart of the corporate agenda.<br />Ms. Quart argues that our children bear unmistakable psychological, physical and financial scars from this assault. Media-induced anxiety leads boys to steroid abuse and girls to anorexia; social acceptance is garnered by the flaunting of expensive designer clothes and accessories; class status is predicated by admission to brand-name colleges; and so on. The end result is a hyper-competitive, anxious and debt-ridden generation of youths who collectively are getting locked into the cycle of labor and consumption at a significantly earlier age than their predecessors.<br />It may be true that Ms. Quart's work depends heavilly on observations drawn from the ranks of upper middle-class society, but she has impressively succeeded in describing a phenomenon that has largely eluded others. The reader is impressed by the author's ability to synthesize scholarly research, pop culture, business information, anecdotes and first-person interviews to make her case. In short, this is original and cutting-edge research that should give inquisitive readers much to ponder.<br />I recommend this book to parents of teenagers (like myself) who want to understand more about the brave new world their children are inhabiting as well as to teenagers who want to critically deconstruct and reclaim their branded selves.ibing a phenomenon that has largely eluded others.

Arianna Huffington's &quot;Pigs at the Trough&quot; is a scathing indictment of the corporate, accounting and investment &quot;pigs&quot; who have gotten fat at the public's expense. The author makes clear that this feeding frenzy has been made possible by their sold-out lackeys in Washington who seem more than willing to pass any laws that the pigs might ask for. While Huffington's profiles of the corporate CEOs who have been the biggest beneficiaries of this rigged game are at turns hilarious and disgusting, her analysis of what this all means for ordinary workers and citizens are sobering.<br />After reading how the pigs perpetrated many of their scams, the reforms suggested by Huffington appear to be logical. You might think that the business community would want to implement like changes in the wake of the stock market implosion in order to restore investor confidence, but it appears not to be the case. Huffington shows how politicians from both parties are skilled at creating legislative loopholes while simultaneously giving lip service to the need for &quot;corporate responsibility&quot;. All this suggests that the inability of our nation's institutions to police themselves could lead to even worse abuses in the future.<br />Fortunately, Huffington includes a list of worthy activist organizations in the appendix. Since our elected officials are clearly not willing to clean the sty, it is up to the people to make sure that their voices are heard. To that end, &quot;Pigs at the Trough&quot; will inform, entertain and inspire you to do what needs to be done. Highly recommended!	2003-02-24

(New Democracy Forum)	Books	5	5	5	N	Y	Thought provoking	Philippe Van Parij's deceptively simple but powerful proposal is to establish a Universal Basic Income (UBI) for all citizens of the U.S. Throughout the book's 130-odd pages, readers are challenged by Van Parij and 15 prominent respondents to critique the idea and to examine related core values and beliefs. The result is a book that has the rare virtue of being thought provoking; over time, it may prove to be widely influential as well.<br />What I found interesting is that the boldness of Van Parij's proposal succeeds in exposing the fact that much of what passes as conventional wisdom may be surprisingly vulnerable to radical critique. As the global economy continues to dramatically change labor's relationship to capital, it is clear that existing social welfare programs have been based on an imagined world that no longer exists. But while the neoliberal assault to dismantle the social safety net may not be just, it is widely acknowledged. Van Parij courageously demonstrates that change provides an opportunity for the Left to plausibly propose an agenda that moves in the opposite direction.<br />Ultimately, what at first glance might appear to be pie-in-the-sky thinking rapidly gains currency. On the whole, Van Parijs and his critics show that the UBI (or like policies) can provide a reasonable and humane solution for people adapting to life within today's hyper-competitive global market economy.<br />In short, I highly recommend this book for students or anyone else who may be interested in contemplating how a better society might come to pass.	2003-02-07

It holds important lessons for those who want to learn how conditions for millions of workers have deteriorated so rapidly and what we might consider in order to correct the situation. The author's meticulous documentation and professional writing should also make this book valued by other serious researchers for many years to come.<br />Ms. Rosen shows that power and ideology have played a large part in this story. The Asian apparel industry was allowed limited access to U.S. markets in order to contain the threat of Communist expansion in the early Cold War era. Later, neoliberal economists supported by the retail industry prevailed upon the Regan, Bush Sr. and Clinton administrations to promote apparel production in the Caribean and Mexico.<br />The author shows that workers' rights have consistently taken a back seat to these larger political and economic concerns. She demonstrates that the tightly-controlled system of globalized production and distribution does not much resemble the mutually-beneficial free trade model envisioned by Adam Smith and David Ricardo. Instead, mostly young and female workers are prevailed upon to produce at poor wages; they are viewed as mere inputs in a closed-loop system of finance and production. If these workers protest against the low value that has been pre-assigned to their labor, the corporation can easily replace these workers or move elsewhere to achieve its profit objectives.<br />Ms. Rosen's book helps us understand not only how the post-industrial era has come about but also how it has been such a boon to capitalist managers and financiers. On the other hand, the opening of markets to low-wage countries means that free trade has been a race to the bottom for the working class. She suggests that the future for apparel workers will be grim until disparities in wealth between rich and poor nations are narrowed and worker's and women's rights are acknowledged.<br />Ms. Rosen has written a history book that matters a great deal with respect to the quality of life we enjoy both in the U.S. and around the world, and I strongly urge you to read it.poor nations are narrowed and worker's and women's rights are acknowledged. <br />Ms. Rosen has written a history book that matters a great deal with respect to the quality of life we enjoy both in the U.S. and around the world, and I strongly urge you to read it.	2003-02-02

Whether it was due to the deadline pressures of submitting her newspaper columns, her proximity to numerous protest sites, or her keen understanding of contemporary politics, Ms. Klein's writing in this book is as powerful, concise and insightful as it has ever been.<br />While Ms. Klein herself might modestly suggest that this book represents a \\"stopgap\\" effort sandwiched between \\"No Logo\\" and her forthcoming research project, you will be impressed by the author's dedication and conviction to the subject matter. The book has been given structure by grouping its articles into discreet categories that in turn relate to the \\"fences and windows\\" theme. For example, the section \\"Fencing in Democracy\\" contains stories that describe the ways in which the benefits of free trade have largely been realized by the rich but not the poor, while \\"Windows to Democracy\\" describes how formerly exploited communities and peoples have managed to positively transform and better their lives in creative ways.<br />Throughout the book, Ms. Klein's intellect and analysis is in top form. She skillfully and routinely turns the tables on neoliberal propaganda, exposing the greed and hypocrisy at the heart of the corporate agenda. For example, \\"Genetically Altered Rice: You Can't Eat Public Relations\\" deconstructs the claim that genetically engineered (GE) \\"golden rice\\" could save millions of lives in Asia. The author correctly points out that malnutrition has more to do with policy decisions than with technology, and that pushing the GE solution is to merely sustain and perpetuate the profits of the agribusiness industry at the expense of the people.<br />In its totality, the book suggests a world that has become post-democratic in the sense that unelected organizations and unaccountable corporations are exerting greater control over people's lives than perhaps at any time in recent human history. But Ms. Klein has given voice to the scores of people who are speaking truth to power.

Paul Begala's \\"It's Still the Economy, Stupid\\" serves as a welcome reality check on the George W. Bush administration's propaganda war. While Republicans always seem eager to attach the \\"class warfare\\" label onto Democrats, Begala makes clear that the Republicans have long been on the offensive.<br /><br />Begala looks at numerous examples of Bush administration doublespeak to expose the Republican's real agenda. Not surprisingly, Begala has found that Bush's brand of \\"compassionate conservatism\\" looks a lot like plain old right-wing conservatism: it is pro-corporate and pro-wealth on the one hand and anti-environment and anti-working class on the other. Begala ties specific pieces of legislation to the lobbying activities of their sponsors to reveal a government with deep ties to the business community in general and to corporate cronys like Enron and Halliburton in particular.<br /><br />Begala contends that the Bush tax cuts for the rich are pulling the rug out from under the American people. He rightly points out that taxes can be more equitably cut in other ways (such as reducing the payroll tax) but suggests that Bush has purposely selected the income and inheritance taxes because reductions to these taxes disproporitionately benefits his wealthy campaign donors. Unfortunately, these decisions are creating enormous future deficits that, if left unchallenged, ultimately threatens to bankrupt social security and other vital programs that the working class has come to rely upon.<br /><br />Begala is to be congratulated for being a stuanch defender of the Clinton administration. You are reminded that Republicans vehemently opposed the policies that proved critical in turning the corner to economic success during the 1990s. Begala shows that it is possible to create a strong economy marked by widely shared prosperity. Contrasting the Clinton success story with the unconscionable looting of the federal treasury by the Bush-Cheney team, the author makes us rethink what our definition of scandalous behavior ought to be. (On the other hand, one should not look to Begala to find a critique of how Clinton's ill-advised deregulation of Wall Street and free trade policies with China conspire to undermine middle class prosperity over the long haul.)<br /><br />Begala's writing is energetic and full of humor, giving Democratic partisans something to cheer about during these long, dark days. But what sets the book apart from the average political screed is its thorough documentation and use of facts.

Books	4	3	4	N	Y	Scholarly analysis	Thomas Homer-Dixon's \\"Environment, Scarcity and Violence\\" offers a scholarly analysis of the role environmental scarcity plays in spawning violent human conflicts. The author uses social science research methodology to isolate the independent variable of environmental scarcity in order to study the ways it may or may not contribute to violence. Importantly, Homer-Dixon has found that environmental scarcity, while insignificant in itself, is a significant factor in amplifying the underlying tensions that may in turn fuel a society's descent into violence.<br />The author goes on to argue that countries that possess sufficient quantities of ingenuity may be able to avert violence by curing their environmental crises through the application of advanced technological and managerial skills. On the other hand, nations that lack ingenuity -- or those who lose intellectual capital as the result of their deteriorating environments -- are more apt to descend into violence as these societies negatively respond to their crises by turning against themselves.<br />Although the book provides no easy answers to the stated problems, it does suggest that democracy and international cooperation will be badly needed in the struggle to create a peaceful and stable planet. I strongly recommended this outstanding book to policy makers and others who are interested in learning how we might secure a non-violent future for ourselves in an increasingly tumultuous world.	2003-01-05
US	52736752	R1MEWPHC7WA4P3	0520224655	994413013	Food Politics: How the Food Industry Influences Nutrition and Health (California Studies in Food and Culture)	Books	5	152	157	N	Y	The food industry's assault on your health	Nutrition expert Marion Nestle's \\"Food Politics\\" explains how the formula for a healthy diet hasn't changed. She advises that one should eat more plant-based foods (fruits, vegetables and whole grains) and less meat, dairy and sweets. But this message collides with the interests of the food-industrial complex, which makes the bulk of its profits by selling relatively expensive processed foods. The book examines how corporations have successfully fought the health message by using a number of overt and covert tactics to further their objectives at the public's expense.<br />In fact, this business success story has resulted in a generation of Americans who are significantly overweight compared with their predecessors. Nestle shows that public relations and government lobbying result in obfuscation and mixed messages about the relative values of certain foods; this generally confuses Americans and makes it difficult to get the \\"eat less\\" message. Interestingly, she reveals that the amount of sweets and snack foods consumed are in almost exact proportion to the advertising dollars spent promoting these foods, suggesting that limits on advertising junk food to children might be a reasonable first step in addressing this problem.<br />But Nestle is particularly critical of the criminally poor quality of the nation's public school lunch program and the \\"pouring rights\\" contracts struck with soft drink companies by cash-starved school districts. Our country's apparent unwilingness to provide nutritious meals to our schoolchildren is shameful, and Nestle should be congratulated for bringing the situation to light.<br />Other noteworthy sections of the book address the deregulation of dietary supplements and the invention of \\"techno-foods\\", ie foods that have been fortified with vitamins, minerals or herbal ingredients. The overall picture is one of regulators on the defensive and huckster capitalism run rampant. While it was disturbing but not too surprising to learn about relatively obscure supplement makers making absurd claims for products that have little scientifically proven value, it was somewhat amusing to see a reprint of a short-lived advertisement for Heinz ketchup that promoted its supposed cancer-fighting properties. It appears there are no limits to what kinds of food products might be similarly reinvented by marketers in their quest for higher profits.<br />In the closing chapter, Nestle proposes a number of useful solutions. Her ideas are reasonable and display a maturity gained through many years spent in government and academia. In an environment where food choices and information surrounding food products are increasingly difficult to understand, let's hope that this book inspires us all to demand greater accountability from the food companies that feed us.

As this book makes clear, such an act of unprovoked aggression is in clear violation of the United Nations and would render much harm to our relationships with other countries around the world.<br />Overall, the book does a great job of deconstructing much of the anti-Iraqi propaganda that has recently been heaped upon the American public. But while Saddam Hussein is certainly no saint, the fact remains that our onetime ally has been doing our dirty work for years. Indeed, Saddam's dictatorship has served to effectively check the growing influence of Islamic fundamentalism. Contrary to President Bush's rhetoric, this is the real reason why the U.S. purposely left him in power at the conclusion of the Gulf War. The author details how U.S. forces allowed Iraq's Republican Guard troops to escape U.S. General Schwartzkopf's trap in southern Iraq so that they could move to quell the Kurdish rebellion in the north, ensuring the survival of Saddam's regime.<br />According to a recent article in Forbes magazine, it is estimated that Iraq's undiscovered oil reserves may equal Saudi Arabia's. Bush is obviously trying to promote an Iraqi-Al Qaeda connection in order to drum up support for an invasion that will ultimately allow U.S. oil corporations to profitably exploit these reserves. The losers in such an endeavor are U.S. taxpayers and of course the long-suffering Iraqi people.<br />Noam Chomsky has contributed an essay to this book reminding us that American foreign policy has often failed to live up to the country's democratic ideals: Guatemala, Vietnam and East Timor are just a few examples. The great irony in this latest episode is that the goal in Iraq is merely \\"regime change\\", not democracy; in other words, we want to replace Saddam with another strongman, not let the Iraqi people govern themselves. This should be reason alone to oppose the war, as if supporting another corporate oil war wasn't bad enough.<br />In short, \\"War Plan Iraq\\" gives us many reasons why we should avoid this unnecessary war, and in so doing gives us much to reflect upon as U.S. citizens. Perhaps if we want a better world, we should focus not on Iraq but on changing the regime in Washington, D.C. Leadership dedicated to peace and democracy would make us proud; but Bush's war mongering and despotism shames us all.<br />I can not recommend this timely, relevant and important book any more highly.ange\\", not democracy; in other words, we want to replace Saddam with another strongman, not let the Iraqi people govern themselves.

Importantly, the author compares and contrasts the failures of the ecological economics model with the more promising ecosocialist paradigm, arguing that the latter is humanity's best chance to create a stable, healthy and humane world.<br />I haven't read any other books by Foster, but it is hard to imagine a better effort. This powerful little book is written with passion, clarity and purpose. Foster seems to pack more meaning in 170 pages than others who use twice the space. Consequently one can imagine the book serving as an excellent supplemental textbook for students who may be interested in rapidly developing their critical thinking skills.<br />Many of the articles discuss how the growth of capitalism is leading to environmental collapse. Foster shows that assigning market values to nature and introducting relatively less harmful technologies will not end the destruction. Rather, these so-called Green Economics solutions will merely lead to a \\"more efficient exploitation of the environment\\" (pg. 58) by the capital markets.<br />Foster strongly believes that a moral element is at play. The \\"higher immorality\\" of the bourgeoise class is implicit in its accumulation of material goods and profits at the expense of the poor and the environment; but it is also sometimes explicitly stated, such as in Lawrence Summers' infamous World Bank memo where a policy of exporting pollution to poor countries was rationalized because the economies are less developed there.<br />In my opinion, one of the best passages on the issue of morality concerned Foster's devastating critique of Malthus, who was one of the original apologists for the privileged class. Foster brilliantly turns the cult of Malthusianism on its head by arguing that the environmental crisis is a result of overconsumption by the rich, not the poor. Foster points out that neo-Malthusianism remains influential within neoliberal thought and argues forcefully that it must end if we are to ever stop deluding ourselves and get to work on real solutions to the crisis.<br />Foster's personal experiences with the timber industry conflicts in the Pacific Northwest are related in the book's lengthiest essay. The author discusses the limits of achieveing environmental sustainability without class struggle and the support of labor. Interestingly, Foster demonstrates the practical value of ecosocialist theory by articulating a workable solution that went beyond the rhetoric of \\"jobs versus logs\\". Perhaps not surpisingly, the author tells us that the promising proposal was quashed by a Bush Sr. administration official in favor of a pro-industry solution.<br />Ultimately, Foster shows that an ecosocialist society that values democracy, community and nature can indeed create \\"a positive, not just a negative, alternative to capitalism\\" (pg. 132). I urge you to read this outstanding book., not the poor.

The book seeks to inspire decision makers and business leaders to build on the success of this innovative program. He proposes that similar projects should be launched with the goal of providing opportunities for employees and consumers to gain ownership stakes in the businesses in which they work and spend their money.<br />Gates argues that the increasingly finance-driven economy has changed the face of capitalism, a phenomenon that has accelerated in recent years. The author shows how the decisions made by detached financial managers results in a system that mainly rewards investors who, by definition, are already wealthy. The speed with which these investments can be reallocated purges the economy of do-good business managers who might choose to devote resources to so-called nonproductive means (such as worker benefits or environmental protections), meaning that workers and society consistently end up losers in this game. Gates believes that the resulting worker insecurity and the marginalization of ever-larger segments of the population ultimately threatens the long-term viability of our democracy.<br />In contrast, Gates believes that broadening ownership will allow more citizens to feel connected to their workplace and community. His proposals are imaginative but appear to be doable; in fact, some are being practiced in limited form in various places. Here, Gates' writing is at its best. You'll enjoy reading about how DSOPs, GSOPs, CSOPs, RESOPs, VSOPs and yes, ESOPs can help to revitalize the economy and repair our frayed society. Gates suggests that what is needed is the political will to promote these solutions on a larger scale in order to have greater impact and make a difference in people's lives.<br />Interestingly, a writer in Forbes magazine recently remarked in a condescending manner that ESOPs represent an odd mixture of capitalist and socialist ideas. This suggests to me that the idea has merit. A capitalism that only succeeds in rewarding the top executives of Enron and Citicorp with lavish pay-outs is not sustainable nor is it worth saving. But a capitalism that rewards hard-working employees and consumers with the greater prosperity that comes with earning an ownership stake, as envisioned by Gates, is certainly worth striving for. To that end, I heartily recommend Gates' book to all who are looking for ideas to help save capitalism and to secure the future of our society.that ESOPs represent an odd mixture of capitalist and socialist ideas.

The book's expert analysis of the relationship between private corporations and the plundering of the earth's resources successfully contextualized the protests as few other books written at that time were able.<br />Since then of course, many have written about globalization and its effects. But I think Karliner's work continues to stand out from the pack and has in fact gained strength as events continue to unfold. The ascendancy of the pro-oil industry Bush administration and its strident anti-environmentalist agenda seems to confirm his thesis: namely, that corporations and their elected cronies (or unelected cronies, in Bush's case) often proclaim themselves to be environmentally friendly on the one hand while simultaneously rolling back environmental protections on the other.<br />When push comes to shove, the quest to accumulate profits wins over the environment. Karliner does an excellent job of showing how corporate PR or \\"greenwash\\" and corporate sustainable development initiatives provide smokescreens for doing business as usual. But when given the opportunity, Karliner documents how companies such as Chevron lobby hard to roll back protections when given a favorable political situation like the one that existed when Republicans gained control of Congress in the mid-1990s.<br />The author supports his theory by effectively using case studies to illustrate how these dynamics play out in the real world. Large corporations such as Mitsubishi use their economic power to bend governments and citizens to their will, in the process impoverishing communities and environments as local resources are stripped away for the benefit of distant investors.<br />Karliner proposes a number of remedies that can help turn the situation around. He reasons that greater democratic input and corporate acocuntability is badly needed if we want people and the environment to be given primacy over the rights of the privileged few to reap the rewards of globalization for themselves. While Karliner may not have detailed a specified course of action -- no single person could be expected to do that -- it seems obvious that he has successfully defined the parameters of the struggle.<br />Intelligently written and supplemented with numerous footnotes and statistics, I believe it is not too much to say that \\"The Corporate Planet\\" is a classic work. I strongly recommended it for those who want to learn more about globalization and the central role corporations are playing in the destruction of the environment.cy over the rights of the privileged few to reap the rewards of globalization for themselves.

Daily and Ellison acknolwedge the contradiction that such a task entails, but they seem all too eager to discover opportunities where nature can be exploited in new ways to suit capital's ever-changing needs (as if this insight was somehow novel!). In fact the individual case studies represent a mixed bag in that a few appear to offer some hope for the environment while others appear to offer more hope for capital's expansion than for the earth.<br />But even among what I count as the more hopeful stories, precious little of the projects' success could be attributable to capital. Probably the best among them concerned the organic farming movement, which includes related efforts to preserve biodiveristy and substitute natural predatory insects for pesticides. As everyone knows, this is a movement that has been defined by its explicit rejection of standard corporate practices, yet the authors sheepishly do little to point this out. Another excellent chapter focused on the efforts of a dedicated scientist to preserve rainforest in Costa Rica. But while the scientist helped broker a deal from an orange juice manufacturer to dump its waste in the rainforest to promote regrowth in damaged areas, it seemed clear that the Costa Rican government played a much larger role in the cause of preservation that the manufacturer ever did. And of course the watershed protection project for the New York City area was spearheaded by sometimes belligerent public interest groups and the local government over significant opposition from private-property forces.<br />Among the less dubious stories: an Australian who is building Jurassic Park-style nature enclaves in hopes of attracting tourist dollars; an ex-Internet entrepreneur who hopes to cash in big by creating an overnight market for the buying and selling of the carbon-storing capacity of forests; and a political \\"deal maker\\" skilled in both obtaining and extracting concessions from developers in the hopes of merely slowing development. The market solutions highlighted in these and other stories point to the self-evident fragility of these projects to sustain themselves in the long run.<br />In an unitentionally humorous part of the book, the authors recount a think-tank exercise in which EVERYONE participating in the pretend game of land stewardship clear-cut their forest assets in the final round of play in order to maximize their returns. My criticism is not that there isn't some merit in what the protagonists of these stories are doing -- they appear to be remarkable individuals who may simply be making the best of their bad situations -- but if the world's future is dependent on the success of these individuals in coming up with market solutions to the world's environmental problems, then may God help us all.<br />In the end, this book fails to make a persuasive argument that capitalism can save the environment. There is some value to the case studies presented by the authors, especially where victories were achieved through democratic actions -- but this latter point was unfortunately down-played through much of the book in favor of the capitalist theme. But I think that contrary to the author's opinion, it seems obvious that the environment will continue to be exploited as long as for-profit capitalism rules the day. Therefore, I think that readers who want real answers to today's burgeoning environmental crisis will not find them in this book.epreneur who hopes to cash in big by creating an overnight market for the buying and selling of the carbon-storing capacity of forests; and a political \\"deal maker\\" skilled in both obtaining and extracting concessions from developers in the hopes of merely slowing development.

Books	5	42	43	N	Y	An Ecosocialist Manifesto	Joel Kovel's \\"The Enemy of Nature\\" offers a powerful and unflinching eco-Marxist critique of the capitalist system. Concluding that the path of accumulation must inevitably lead to a world wide ecological crisis, the author theorizes about the type of \\"ecosocialist\\" system that must supplant capitalism in order to ensure humanity's survival.<br />Kovel is part of a growing \\"Red/Green\\" movement that also includes the outstanding Marxist scholar James O'Connor. Kovel's arguments seem to build upon and indeed are closely aligned with many of the ideas in O'Connor's excellent book \\"Natural Causes,\\" but I personally find Kovel's writing to be a bit more accessible than O'Connor's. Perhaps this pragmatism can be attributed to Kovel's political sensibilities, as he was a candidate for the Green Party Presidential nomination in 2000.<br />Kovel believes that various forms of so-called \\"Green economics\\" are doomed to failure because they do not address what he sees as the root problem driving the ecological crisis: namely, capital's need to continuously expand. He points out that whatever gains might be realized from the introduction of environmentally-friendly technology will be quickly outweighed by the expansion of the economy. For example, fuel cells might be less harmful than internal combustion engines, but if the technology merely enables the manufacture of hundreds of millions of new automobiles, the planet will ultimately be much worse off.<br />But Kovel acknowledges that the current Green movement is in fact helping to lay the groundwork for what is yet to come. The Green's emphasis on local democratic control of the means of production will help free labor from its bondage with capital, which is essential for socialism to succeed.<br />Of course, Kovel devotes a section to readers who may need to be reminded that really existing socialism as practiced in the Soviet Union and elsewhere was NOT what Marx intended. Kovel shows that these countries actually substituted the state for the market, in the end merely proving that markets were superior to centralized planning. The ruined environments left behind by the Communist states were testaments to a failed attempt at accumulation, in much the same way that the West is currently degrading the air, land and sea in its ongoing frenzy of  accumulation.<br />Kovel speculates on how collapse might occur in the capitalist nations. He understands that a breakdown of the financial system could easily lead to fascism, or possibly \\"ecofascism\\", as capital seeks to hold on to power. But Kovel thinks it may be plausible that the pockets of production growing outside the bounds of capital may be strong enough to resist the counter-revolution. Indeed, Kovel points out that up to 20 percent of the world economy already exists in the \\"informal\\" sector, although most of this is comprised of criminal activity and much less of the positive kind (such as the Bruderhof communities of the U.S.).<br />This latter part of Kovel's analysis bears similarity to Nick Dyer-Witheford's \\"Cyber-Marx\\", although Kovel does not appear to be aware of this book nor is it referenced in his bibliography. In short, Dyer-Witheford theorizes that technophiles will appropriate the means of production in order to empower a society that eventually achieves autonomy by existing outside the bounds of capitalist control. Like Kovel, Dyer-Witheford envisions that the post-capitalist society will choose to apply its surplus value to the cause of freeing labor and restoring its ravaged social, physical and natural environments. In my view, the convergence of these two authors' thoughts -- albeit arrived at from different angles, but perhaps more compelling because of this -- bolsters both of their arguments and suggests that the possibility of radical change may not be as elusive as one might suppose.<br />I strongly recommend Kovel's book for anyone who may be concerned about the future of our society or for those who may be contemplating how a more humane world might come about.be contemplating how a more humane world might come about.	2002-09-26

The author's message has a certain edginess in that he is one of a small but albeit growing number of Republicans who are weighing in against the drug war. Of particular note, Eldredge was co-chairman for the California Gubernatorial campaign of Ronald Reagan, who was perhaps the nation's most vocal drug warrior. Yet there wasn't a single word in this book that I could disagree with.<br />Eldredge is encouraging us to act like grown-ups and provide the caring and compassion that drug abusers need. Through the use of numerous statistics that are supplemented by some interesting anecdotes, the author overwhelmingly shows that interdiction has failed. The bottom line is that illegal drugs remain readilly available to those who seek them. But their illegal status has proven to be a boon to the drug lords, street gangs and other undesirable elements -- including Afghan terrorists, as we have recently learned -- who are attracted to the promise of quick and (usually) easy profits.<br />Edlredge contends that de-criminalization will swiftly take away the profit motive and bust up the drug gangs, both here at home and in places like Columbia and Mexico. Safer streets will enhance the quality of life for our citizens and no doubt help stablize the governments of countries where drug lords are nearly as powerful as the state. And for the user, government distribution will ensure a safer supply of drugs and, importantly, provide the drug user with a point of contact who could arrange treatment, should it ever be requested.<br />Eldredge's discussion of the nuances of how the anti-drug laws should be changed and the types of programs that need to be implemented show that he has spent a fair amount of time carefully considering the issue. But Eldredge takes care to critique the drug war in terms familiar to most Conservatives: as an example of wasteful government spending. If criminalizing drugs is not working as a deterrent to behavior patterns, and if it does not suppress the supply, then the government should logically search for alternative solutions where it may be able to get a better return on its investments.<br />One hopes that the mature message found in this book will be heeded by a growing number of policy makers. I encourage you to read it and to join the growing number of Americans who think that sanity and clarity of purpose should rightly replace the current state of insanity and corruption that unfortunately characterizes our country's current drug war strategy.terms familiar to most Conservatives: as an example of wasteful government spending.

The result is a well-researched, balanced and highly readable review of suburban sprawl and its effects on the community, economy and environment. It also suggests ways we might mitigate sprawl by opting for policies that encourage \\"smart growth\\", i.e. development that takes a holistic view of the community and its role within the larger society in which we all live.<br />With thorough documentation, charts and illustrations to support the author's work, one can easily imagine the book serving well as an introductory college textbook on the subject. It should also be welcomed by community activists and concerned citizens alike who may want to prepare themselves for intelligent discussion and engagement when faced with the problem of sprawl in their own local communities.<br />The authors discuss the numerous reasons why sprawl has become such a big problem in our country. Of course the closely related and interconnected topics of the American love affair with the automobile, the building of the interstate highway system and the dismantling of big city public transportation systems by General Motors are cited as factors that enabled and encouraged the post-WW II mass exodus from most major cities to their surrounding suburban areas. But the authors also point out that uncoordinated local governments generally make it difficult for America to develop comprehensive land use policies, allowing land developers and corporations to run amok and get what they wanted with respect to tax breaks, permits, and so on.<br />The end result is that businesses have found it only too easy to relocate to cheaper land outside the core cities (if not to foreign countries), setting in motion a cycle of urban decline that pushes even more people to the suburbs and the inexpensive houses available there.<br />The authors don't blame Americans for desiring the relatively clean air, open spaces, and safe schools and neighborhoods that suburbia purports to offer. But as the boundaries push ever outward, the benefits become ever more difficult to attain and a myriad of new problems emerge. For example, commuting costs -- in terms of both time and money -- can wipe out much of the savings on housing. The problem is compounded by the deleterious effects of stress to the psyche that are associated with driving ever longer distances to work. All of this extra driving also contributes enormously to the problems of both global warming and local air pollution. Significantly, local government budgets quickly become depleted trying to keep up with spiraling highway construction and maintenance costs.<br />The authors suggest remedies and also allude to success stories in places such as Portland, Oregon, the State of Maryland, and Europe to discuss some of the alternatives that may help contain sprawl. In each case, it seems that revitalizing and creating a truly livable inner city is integral to creating a winning strategy.<br />Whether the U.S. can truly reverse sprawl before most of its open spaces are consumed remain an open question, of course. One suspects that regional planners acting in the community's interest will have a tougher time reigining in the rugged, individualistic American than his or her European counterpart. But one has to wonder whether continuing to consume every two years over one million acres of open lands -- much of it valuable and irreplacable farmlands and wetlands -- should rightly be called progress, and what the consequences of this unwritten policy of perpetual destruction might hold for us in the long run.<br />In brief, this excellent book contains much for us to think about. It provides guidance and inspiration to those among us who dare to believe that a stronger community, a better environment, and a higher quality of life may indeed be possible without sprawl. Highly recommended.without sprawl. Highly recommended.	2002-09-01

The author includes profiles of scientists who theorized and then later documented the greenhouse effect (such as Svante Arrhenius) as well as the entrepreneurs whose inventions have contributed significantly to the problem (such as Ford).<br />The author addresses the issue of why the earth experienced a slight cooling trend from the 1940s to the early 1970s, prior to the more recent period of steadily rising temperatures: the period in question witnessed twice the normal amount of volcanic activity, which helped block sunlight from reaching the earth.<br />The evidence cited by the author strongly suggests that the earth is warming due to human activity. Yet, Christianson inexplicably accords the well-known greenhouse skeptic Fred Singer's criticisms of greenhouse theory more respect than this coal and oil industry-funded mouthpiece deserves. If the author did this in order to appear objective, he did so at the cost of confusing corporate propaganda with real science.<br />In fact, my criticism of the book is that it contains precious little analysis. Christianson is a gifted storyteller, and no doubt many will enjoy his entertaining narrative. But the reader who seeks insight and understanding into why our society privileges technology at the expense of nature will need to look elsewhere.<br />Still, I think Christianson has succeeded in his mission of writing a great book for the general interest science reader. It should help further the cause of making the science of global warming an increasingly popular topic of conversation in our society.ll, I think Christianson has succeeded in his mission of writing a great book for the general interest science reader.

Sports fans Joanna Cagan and Neil deMause combine original and secondary research with interviews to successfully chronicle and analyse the public stadium building boom in an entertaining yet thought-provoking manner.<br />Cagan and deMause paint a picture of a playing field that is decidedly not even. Local communities are pitted in a struggle against powerful coalitions of wealthy sports moguls, politicos, real estate developers and other related businesspeople (which oftentimes includes the local media, since sports helps sells newspapers and TV advertising) over the allocation of increasingly scarce public tax revenues. The authors show that public education in particular seems to bear the brunt of the burden whenever the community loses the fight and sees its funds siphoned away to build these private sports palaces.<br />Cagan and deMause detail specific cases where owners have successfully blackmailed communities and strong-armed local politicians. These case studies reveal a formula that the authors term \\"the art of the steal\\", a step-by-step game plan for owners who plan to fleece their communities for free sports structures. Shamelessly exploiting the community's emotional attachments to the home team and ruthlessly working the good-ole-boy business networks to which local politicians are beholden are a few of the key ingredients that helps to make these schemes work, the authors claim.<br />Cagan and deMause interview individuals associated with a few of the grass-roots organizations that sprung up to oppose various stadium initiatives. While such groups often experience initial success, they are usually overwhelmed in the long run by the persistence of the powerful forces lined up against them. Citing numerous opinion polls and voter referendums where citizens strenuously opposed the use of tax dollars to fund privately-owned stadiums, the authors suggest that the reason owners win more often than not is due to the greater political power at their disposal, and not the democratic process.<br />Indeed, the cost to society as a whole is often great. In Chapter 8, \\"Bad Neigbors\\", Cagan and deMause brilliantly relate baseball's current preoccupation with the recreation of a mythic past (through the construction of \\"old time\\" ballparks such as Camden Yards in Baltimore) with the real decay of America's inner cities. The authors discover that many urban centers have actually been subjected to a corporate \\"structural adjustment\\" program akin to those experienced in many Third World nations. They contend that a core problem is a system of private enterprise that privileges the profit motive at the expense of ordinary people.<br />The authors wrap up the book by alluding to signs that the public stadium-building frenzy may be slowing down, but sadly this appears to be the case mainly because most cities large enough to support a sports franchise have already been tapped out. Fortunately, the authors propose common-sense ideas that, if legislated, could discourage some corporate welfare give-aways. For example, the authors wonder why recipients shouldn't be required to report the public subsidies they receive as taxable income? This would vastly diminish the value of such subsidies and encourage private financing for these deals, which is where the authors contend they rightly belong.<br />I strongly recommend this book for both sports fans and non-sports fans alike who may be pondering how our society's infatuation with sports fantasy may be harming the real world in which we live.them.

The book turns a number of received wisdoms on their head and should give everyone concerned about the war on terror a few things to think about.<br />Of course, the authors show that fossil fuels drives American policy in the region. The Clinton and Bush administrations both negotiated with the Taliban for the construction of a natural gas pipeline to be built in Afghan territory despite clear-cut evidence of the regime's human rights abuses. However, the book also makes the eye-popping suggestion that U.S. representatives may have recklessly threatened the Taliban prior to the September 11 attack, thereby provoking Al Qaeda into action.<br />Basically, Brisard and Dasquie explain that Saudi Arabia supports radical Islamic movements (including the Taliban, Al Qaeda and Usama Bin Laden) in order to extend its hegemony over the area. Saudi support of the Taliban, for example, helped keep Afghanistan from falling under Iranian influence. Interestingly, the authors point out that the first arrest warrant ever issued against Usama Bin Laden came not from the U.S. -- which wanted to overlook Usama's behavior in order to keep Saudi oil flowing -- but from Libya.<br />I must admit that all of this came as quite a surprise to me, since Saudi Arabia has always been portrayed as a staunch ally of the U.S. In fact, Brisard and Dasquie recall how U.S. oil companies helped the country develop, but they also show that the Kingdom remains dependent on religion to maintain control over its people. So the country is practically schizophrenic in its need to simultaneously maintain business ties with the U.S. and defend against the spread of Arab nationalism by covertly preaching the gospel of anti-Americanism.<br />The authors go into considerable detail illuminating the people, organizations and financial relationships that make the Saudi-supported terror network possible. The indictments reach the highest levels of Saudi society. In this light, it appears that Usama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda simply spun out of their master's control and took the anti-American cause too far.<br />All this should give us pause to consider why the U.S. allowed the Saudis to play such a dangerous game for so long. Also, one would think that prudence should compel the U.S. to develop an energy policy that does not depend on Middle Eastern oil. But already, Brisard and Dasquie report that talks for the pipeline have resumed since the installation of the Karzai regime in Afghanistan in May 2002.<br />On a technical note, the book could benefit from additional editorial work to correct a few grammatical errors (presumably due to the translation from French to English?) and several footnote mistakes. Stylistically, the author's research sometimes makes for dry reading, but that is only because the facts have been meticulously documented and presented. So although \\"Forbidden Truth\\" is at times far from entertaining, the reader is nevertheless impressed with the professionalism of the research and its air-tight conclusions. (Indeed, sensing the threat that the book poses to its business empire, the Bin Laden family succeeded in getting the book banned in Switzerland.)<br />\\"Forbidden Truth\\" is recommended for anyone who wants to gain a better understanding of the dynamics underlying the war on terror.ing the people, organizations and financial relationships that make the Saudi-supported terror network possible.

Bush's Military-Industrial Complex	Books	5	19	24	N	Y	Reminding us of our responsibilities	Dr. Helen Caldicott's \\"The New Nuclear Danger\\" documents the huge nuclear arsenal at our disposal and chillingly describes the horrible consequences of a nuclear exchange. Clearly, the idea of a winnable nuclear war is an oxymoron.<br /><br />With the Soviet Union dissolved, one would think that the U.S. would be scaling back its arsenal. But Dr. Caldicott alerts us to the reality that the U.S. is significantly upgrading its capabilities, revealing to us the major taxpayer-funded research projects that are currently developing the next-generation of deadly nuclear weapons.<br /><br />Dr. Caldicott offers the reader many unsettling facts. For example, it was appalling to learn that NASA regularly launches nuclear-powered space vehicles and that the department is playing a substantial supporting role in the militarization of space through the Star Wars program. The author warns about the very real possibility of an accident during launch or re-entry of one of these spaceships and she describes the horrifying health consequences of mass exposure to plutonium that could ensue.<br /><br />In another revealing passage, Dr. Caldicott contends that Gulf War Syndrome was caused by the deployment of depleted uranium (DU) munitions. Thousands of rounds of DU was spent during the conflict, creating a radioactive battelfield. The area will remain contaminated forever unless it is cleaned up; meanwhile, soldiers and innocents alike will continue to suffer from exposure long into the future.<br /><br />Analyzing the root causes of U.S. militarism, Dr. Caldicott contends that there are structural problems in the U.S. system of government that urgently need correction. Chief among them is the influence that large corporations such as Lockheed-Martin have in shaping government policy. Simply put, when defense contractors pay for political campaigns and otherwise get their cronies appointed to key positions, decision making is no longer in the hands of the people. Another critical problem pertains to the unaccountable Pentagon careerists who crave the power that ever-more lethal weapons systems purportedly give them.<br /><br />On that point, Dr. Caldicott details the current Bush administration's deep ties to the defense industry and their allies in the Pentagon. Their collective gung-ho attitude is costing taxpayers dearly as literally hundreds of billions is being spent on wasteful new weapons systems. The author also criticizes the Clinton administration's feeble attempts to significantly roll back the military/industrial complex, suggesting that Clinton probably wasted a historic opportunity to cut the nuclear program to an appropriate post-cold war level.<br /><br />Dr. Caldicott also discusses the important role that propaganda plays. Corporate-funded think tanks persuade the public that  advanced weapons are needed to protect us from terrorists, communists, and other strawmen. One such think tanks wrote the Republican Party's foreign policy platform for the 2000 campaign; subsequent to gaining power, the Bush administration has been actively pursuing these policies. For example, its political confrontations with China and North Korea had been recommended in order to frighten the public into accepting otherwise unwarranted increases in defense spending, which in turn has richly rewarded the think tank sponsors.<br /><br />Dr. Caldicott reasons that security could be achieved by simply rethinking our foreign policy. The author suggests that the money spent on defense could be better spent on curing poverty and disease, improving education, and restoring the environment; in other words, on programs that would make the world a more humane and peaceful place. In my view, this is not merely a naive hope, as some suggest; it is our only alternative.<br /><br />Some extremists have called Dr. Caldicott's statements \\"anti-American\\". But Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Dwight Eisenhower are just a few Americans who warned about the dangers of unchecked corporate power on the functioning of a healthy democracy. (The Lincoln quote cited in the book is from a letter he wrote to Colonel William F. Elkins on Nov. 21, 1864 -- other reviewers had called into question Dr. Caldicott's research.) But surely no one would accuse these people of not being pro-American. Iin my view, Dr. Caldicott is likewise reminding us of our responsibilities of living in the most powerful democracy the world has ever known. As citizens, we cannot reclaim power from the merchants of death until we better understand the truth, no matter how difficult or painful that may be for some of us to accept.<br /><br />To that end, I give this book the highest possible rating. I strongly encourage you to read it and pass it on to someone you care about.democracy. (The Lincoln quote cited in the book is from a letter he wrote to Colonel William F.

The author's bottom-up analysis offers a vivid description of corporate self-destruction at work, and suggests why mega-mergers in certain industries (such as banking) have failed to meet expectations.<br />The book suggests that much of the heralded productivity gains of the 1990s were due not to the wonders of technology but to the kind of old-fashioned sweatshop labor practices that Karl Marx might have recognized in an earlier era: unpaid and compulsory overtime, cuts in pension and health benefits, homework, speed-up, etc. Fraser cites numerous sources and statistics to show that the era of the paternalistic corporation that thrived from the 1950s to the 1970s has given way to today's unsentimental corporation that values only the bottom line and regularly uses fear as a motivating factor.<br />However, Fraser challenges the idea that fear is a good motivator and that management failures should always be corrected by squeezing the rank and file. She cites figures showing that most companies that have suffered massive layoffs do NOT enjoy better stock market performances than other firms. Her oftentimes moving correspondence with the human casualties of this corporate callousness suggests that this is because the surviving employees become demoralized. They have learned that the rewards for their hard work may never materialize. Their teamwork suffers when workers are taught to become self-reliant but protective \\"free agents\\" of their own careers, and the tendency to self-identify with the success of the company has practically been destroyed.<br />Fraser also highlights the blatant and unconscionable lack of consistency in the executive suites to the call for shared pain among the workers. \\"Chainsaw\\" Al Dunlop, Jack Welch and Michael Eisner are a few of the CEOs who are criticized for accepting lavish pay-outs when their respective corporations were supposedly enduring hard times.<br />Fraser concludes the book with some optimism and proposes a number of suggestions that could help end sweatshop conditions, such as: caps on CEO pay, limits on the use of contingent labor, increased use of employee stock ownership plans, better benefits, and so on. Unfortunately, many of Fraser's ideas depend on their support from enlightened executives and consequently may be of little use. But with the wave of corporate scandals that have roiled America since the book's publication in early 2001, it is possible that change may be legislated anyway to help curb the public's disgust and investor mistrust of corporate America.<br />In the end, Fraser has succeeded in focusing our attention to the fact that the fate of business depends on the well-being of its workers. I believe that \\"White Collar Sweatshop\\" should be read by CEOs, legislators and disaffected workers alike if we are to avoid doing further damage to our lives and our economy.

US	52736752	R12JKQ9M6G7FDX	0738202916	651409436	Lords of the Harvest: Biotech, Big Money, and the Future of Food	Books	4	34	36	N	Y	Great storytelling	Daniel Charles' \\"Lords of the Harvest\\" succeeds in bringing perspective to the biotech industry and the contentious issue of genetically modified food. The author does this by personalizing the protaganists at the heart of the story: the scientists who were driven mainly by the quest for knowledge and discovery; the businesspeople who sought dollar returns from their laboratory investments; and the environmentalists who felt that genetic engineering was simply the latest ugly manifestation of an out-of-control agribusiness industry. The result is a highly entertaining and readable book that should interest a wide audience.<br />The scientists who invented and nurtured the industry tend to get much better treatment from Charles than either the businesspeople or the environmentalists. As a former science reporter for NPR, Charles seems most comfortable painting psychological portraits of the researchers at Monsanto and elsewhere. Charles lovingly details the innovative and pioneering work that these scientists undertook and the intriguing problems they solved. Charles shows how these early projects gave shape to the modern biotech industry, and his writing in these sections is vivid and interesting. And in the chapter \\"Infinite Horizons\\", Charles enthuses about the potential of biotechnology to help solve the world's problems. Throughout, Charles' enthusiasm for science and biotechnology is unmistakable.<br />On the other hand, the businesspeople of biotech get beat up pretty badly in the book. You get the feeling that Charles seems slightly upset that big business can't figure out how to bring the benefits of painstaking scientific discovery to the people. Specifically, Charles relates the numerous and sometimes humorous mistakes made by executives at Monsanto and Calgene (the inventor of the ill-fated \\"Flavr Savr\\" tomato) in their quests to dominate their respective markets. Charles successfully uses these case studies to add color and context to the larger story that he is telling (for example, the author's profile of Monsanto CEO Robert Shapiro and his messianic-like appeal to the company's scientists to help save the world with biotechnology). Charles does an excellent job describing the corporate cultures and the motivations of key individuals, rendering his descriptions of the business wheeling-and-dealing that went on behind the scenes that much more interesting. However, I think that Charles is correct in concluding that it was the arrogance of Monsanto's top executives, more than any other single factor, that ultimately led to the company's demise and the public backlash against biotechnology.<br />Unfortunately, the environmentalists don't get treated much better. Although Charles appears to have abundantly interviewed scientists and businesspeople to gather original material for the book, it doesn't seem that he had much success contacting environmentalists; the profiles of well-known biotech opponents such as Jeremy Rifkin and Benny Sharlin appear to have been drawn from secondary sources. Consequently we don't enjoy the same level of insight regarding their motivations compared with the scientists. So although Charles does a respectable job of reporting why the environmentalists opposed biotech products and the actions that they took, the author's sympathies do not appear to lie with the environmentalists. Instead, Charles deftly swats aside several of the well-known studies that purport to show risks associated with genetically modified crops (such as Dr. Pusztai's rat and John Losey's Monarch butterfly studies). In fact, a certain level of hostility arises when the author makes the charge that environmentalists nevertheless publicized such \\"murky and ill-defined\\" (p. 208) studies purporting risk merely as a way to further their own agendas. But it does not seem to occur to Charles that many environmentalists might have organized the challenge to genetically modified food out of genuine concern for the welfare ofconsumers.<br />I also take slight issue with Charles on two other issues. First is his silence concerning regulation of the biotech industry. His techno-utopian bias leads him to claim that biotech is not substantially different compared with traditional plant and animal breeding practices, with the implication that the public should not be overly concerned about regulation of the industry. But the scientists' tools to recombine DNA in novel ways are so powerful and the effects are so little understood that it is not unreasonable to suggest that a greater level of corporate accountability should be required to ensure that the public interest is protected.<br />Second, Charles should have addressed the recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH) controversy more adequately, given that this was a major Monsanto initiative (the heart of the book was about Monsanto and its scientists). His relative silence on this issue is defeaning: could it be that the environmentalists' charges about the risks of rBGH have at least some merit?<br />Still, I believe that Charles has done a good job of navigating some very tricky ideological terrain. \\"Lords of the Harvest\\" is probably as balanced a book on the subject of biotechnology as any other you'll likely find, and I highly recommend it.consumers. <br />I also take slight issue with Charles on two other issues.

The author takes a look at how markets price themselves in various industries and discusses the relative strengths and weaknesses of the pricing model. Kuttner reveals that in most markets, the public good can be best served by both allowing the \\"virtues\\" of the market to work freely and by implementing regulations that correct whatever \\"limits\\" may be found in any particular market.<br /><br />Kuttner also includes a moral dimension to his discussion, where appropriate. As we all know, markets respond only to money. But as a society, we have decided that it would be immoral, for example, to deny health care to seniors who can't afford to pay; consequently we have Medicare and Medicaid to fix this fundamental market flaw. Similarly, Kuttner shows us where pricing models in certain industries fail to take proper account of environmental, labor and social costs and suggests common-sense ways to correct them.<br /><br />Opinions about the value of Kuttner's work vary widely. Laissez-faire idealogues have charged that the work amounts to \\"socialism\\" (see one of the reviews below). To judge for yourself, take a quick look at just one of the industries that Kuttner critiques in the book: airlines.<br /><br />Kuttner calls the deregulation of the airline industry a \\"failed experiment\\". He points out the many problems that have occured since deregulation, including: declining levels of passenger service, airline consolidation and monopolistic pricing, loss of service to small cities, circuitous routing of flights, declining safety levels, etc. I think most people would agree with the accuracy of Kuttner's assessment and that indeed, air travel has become much less appealing today.<br /><br />Kuttner's solution is to create a system of \\"regulated airline competition\\". Fares would be set at levels that would allow sufficient funds to be allocated to properly maintain planes, better serve passengers, restore service to under-served areas, increase competition, and so on. I found Kuttner's ideas to be reasonable -- not ideological -- in that they balance the needs of business and the public in a fair manner.<br /><br />Of course, Kuttner wrote this in 1999. The terrorist attacks of 9/11 have only made a bad situation worse.  Ironically, public funds were required to save the industry from insolvency. Therefore one could argue that Kuttner's recommendations for greater public accountability is far from unreasonable.<br /><br />Again, the airline industry is just one example. Kuttner also has much to say that is useful about healthcare, energy, finance, labor, and more. As some of these industries currently seem to be imploding due to the excesses of laissez-faire (Enron, Arthur Andersen, WorldCom, etc.), Kuttner's thoughts on the dangers of unregulated behavior prevalent in these industries appears to be more valuable now than ever.<br /><br />In the current climate of investor skepticism and high-profile corporate fraud, tighter controls over business behavior may be just the medicine our economy needs to heal itself, restore investor confidence and ensure that businesses become more responsive to people's needs. In that light, I don't view Kuttner's ideas as socialist at all; rather, I think Kuttner seeks to preserve capitalism by curbing its most destructive tendencies. To that end, \\"Everything for Sale\\" can provide guidance to citizens and policymakers who may be pondering how we can build an economy that works for everyone, not just the one percent.<br /><br />I highly recommend this insightful book to everyone.e passengers, restore service to under-served areas, increase competition, and so on.

The authors explain how the industry can make practically any idea pallatable to the general public. So-called experts write articles, make speeches and appear on television as part of carefully orchestrated multi-media campaigns that are ususally intended to convince us that the corporate point of view is correct.<br />The authors use numerous examples to show that these campaigns are most effective when deploying third-party experts, whose supposed neutrality is a proven attribute in the art of persuasion. But of course these third parties are often industry-funded organizations that can be relied on to state precisely what the corporation wants us to know.<br />I admit that I was surprised by the revelation that many news segments are actually produced by PR departments that are then made credible by voice-overs or spot appearances by a network newsperson. It seems that a sizeable percentage of the \\"news\\" is produced in this manner. (Perhaps that's why there always seems to be a segment about the latest miracle drug discovery on the 6 o'clock news?) It's as if the line between reality and illusion is becoming fuzzier all the time.<br />What is particularly disturbing about the book, however, is the apparent lack of morality in the PR industry. The practitioners of PR seem to have trouble sorting out right from wrong. In fact, the authors explain that the challenge of making a tough sell to the public has the perverse effect of helping firms like Burson-Marsteller charge clients the highest fees and gains these agencies more respect and influence within the industry.<br />The authors point out that the PR industry has become so powerful that it ultimately threatens the functioning of our democracy. As people are unable to sort out real information from propaganda, discourse is stifled and the winners of every argument is the side with the most money.

The book does much to put an end to the conventional argument that economic growth may be the best strategy to achieve an elevated standard of living among the poor.  It also highlights the urgent need to impose tougher regulations on TNC business behavior.<br />Mandeley argues that the characteristics of TNCs and the global economy that has emerged in the post-World War II era has enabled absentee owners to use enormous sums of finance capital and political power to take control of local resources to an extent never possible before. Because the poor have little voice in structuring or negotiating the deal, concerns for worker's wages, health and safety and care for the local environment usually takes a backseat to generating profits for foreign investors.<br />Mandeley spends several chapters looking at the agribusiness sector. Agriculture remains the leading source of employment for most of the world's poor, but the book paints a grim picture of what the future may hold. TNCs are busily engaged in numerous activities -- such as purchasing arable land, patenting seeds and chemicals, introducing genetically engineered crops, and of course controlling commodity market prices -- that are making survival increasingly difficult for small farmers. In addition, government-sponsored exports of tobacco products are inculcating a deadly habit among tens of millions in the developing world.<br />The resource extraction industries of fishing, forestry and mining are examined and shown to be particularly destructive to local communities. While overfishing deprives the poor of an important source of both protein and income, the usually permanent alteration to the landscape caused by unsutainable forestry and mining practices profoundly effects and disrupts local peoples.<br />Other areas that Mandeley explores include manufacturing, energy, tourism, and health. In each instance, the author probes beyond corporate rhetoric to see what the real effects have been on the lives of the poor. A few examples: wage laborers who are paid little for manufacturing toys and clothing for Northern consumers are quickly discarded when their productivity begins to wane or demands for better wages are voiced; dams built to generate energy often cause extreme hardships by displacing people from their ancestral homes; tourism sometimes siphons water resources from local people to support hotel and restaurant operations; and vitamins and pharmaceuticals taken by uneducated consumers oftent create more health problems than they purport to solve.<br />The book concludes with evidence of some small successes in controlling the behavior and accountability of TNCs, but Mandeley suggests that third world nations will probably need to demand fundamental changes in how their relationships are structured with TNCs before the poor can expect better.<br />&quot;Big Business Poor Peoples&quot; is a welcome contribution to the ongoing debate about globalization and its impact on the people of the world.

Average citizens have little to no influence with legislators when compared with the access extremely wealthy capitalists have gained from years of dominating the financing of the major political parties. Declining voter turnout suggests that citizens are resigned to a condition of powerlessness, one of many symptoms of an unhealthy democracy.<br />Against this backdrop, Gates believes that the time is ripe for a new form of populist politics. He boldly sketches out a proposed populist political agenda that he believes could connect with today's disillusioned voters. Gates includes an interesting section where he describes the type of personality an ideal populist Presidential candidate might need to possess in order to attract voters and deal effectively with opposition parties.<br />As a veteran Beltway insider and architect of the legislation that created ESOPs (employee stock ownership plans) in the 1970s, Gates knows a lot about finance, ownership and public policy. He shows how current laws privilege finance at the expense of labor and the environment but argues that such laws can be changed if the people demand it. Therefore, Gates believes that an important task for a populist party will be to educate the public about the link between concentrated financial power and ownership with economic and environmental sustainability.<br />Gates writes with knowledge and passion, but at times the rush of ideas is so intense that the book tends to wander off course. For example, there are dozens of brilliant and imaginative ideas sprinkled throughout the text. But this is sometimes confusing for the reader, given that Gates organized the book into four distinct sections; shouldn't these important solutions have been grouped in one place to facilitate ease of reference?<br />But Gates does in fact reserve section four of the book for his cornerstone idea: &quot;Share Our Wealth&quot;, a highly controversial program of wealth redistribution (from the rich to everyone else). Understanding that this proposal will raise more than a few eyebrows, Gates includes a Question and Answer section to address objections to his plan. But while the idea may have some merit, I think that the proposal would generate such intense opposition that it might overshadow and crush the otherwise adminrable populist agenda that the author has successfully envisioned. Indeed, &quot;Share Our Wealth&quot; is an idea of such magnitude that it more rightly deserves a separate book to flesh out the idea more fully and provide the support it needs to make the idea defensible.<br />Overall, this book in my view accurately diagnoses much of what is wrong with our democracy and proposes some useful populist-flavored solutions, but unfortunately does not convincingly make the case for the &quot;Share Our Wealth&quot; concept. Nevertheless, &quot;Democracy at Risk&quot; is recommended reading for  those who may be pondering how a fully-functioning democracy might be restored in this country.stone idea: &quot;Share Our Wealth&quot;, a highly controversial program of wealth redistribution (from the rich to everyone else).

He seems to be genuinely concerned about where the unregulated use of information technology may be leading us as a society, and has chosen to write his book in an easily accessible style in order to present his views to as wide an audience as possible.<br /><br />\\"Database Nation\\" succeeds overall. The author provides historical context and anecdotes for each topic within the book, helping bring the subject of privacy to life. Indeed, the book contains many interesting, useful and compelling passages. Among these are discussions of identity theft, credit reporting, and direct marketing.<br /><br />Thematically, I tend to agree with the author that a core problem has been the failure of our government to properly regulate the collection and use of consumer data in the private sector. Citing many real-world examples, Garfinkel succeeds in proving that today we have far more to fear from private industry than from government (although there is no doubt that significant problems remain with the way our government handles information).<br /><br />The chapter on \\"Kooks and Terrorists\\", written prior to September 11, was remarkably and tragically prescient. Garfinkel suggests that we might best be served by tightly controlling and monitoring the instruments of destruction rather than attempting to track the entire civilian population. The author reasons that  even if such tracking mechanisms were possible, no such predictive system of monitoring the intentions of millions of individuals could ever be infallible. It would be interesting to learn more about his thoughts on this subject today.<br /><br />However, I was disappointed with the book on several counts. First, despite the repeated use of the word 'privacy', Garfinkel never really develops a theory of privacy: what it is, why we should care about it, and how citizens might be able to simultaneously enjoy the benefits of an information-rich world while living in a society that values and protects its citizens' privacy. Second, I was a bit surprised that the book scarcely addressed the issue of workplace privacy, which has been and remains a highly contentious and important issue for many working class Americans. Third, while Garfinkel often proposes relatively simple but brilliantly conceived laws to secure our privacy rights, at other times he suggests the implementation of additional layers of technology in order to solve problems related to the use of technology; this inconstancy left me a bit puzzled. Fourth, as others have pointed out, there is little information provided about how individuals can take action to protect themselves.<br /><br />Despite these minor flaws, I recommend \\"Database Nation\\" as a fairly good starting point for learning about the important subject of privacy.ble to simultaneously enjoy the benefits of an information-rich world while living in a society that values and protects its citizens' privacy.

The book also suggests what needs to be done to secure a water-rich future for the world.<br />Barlow and Clarke begin their analysis by discussing the shortcomings of many publicly-owned water systems, where the use of science and technology have overwhelmed the carrying capacity of the earth. The author's description of Mexico City literally sinking into the ground as underground water supplies are pumped to exhaustion is frightening.<br />But private ownership of water will not rectify the situation. If the corporations' purpose is to serve shareholder interests, the authors argue, how can anyone suppose that water resources will be managed sustainably or equitably by them? Indeed, the book provides many examples of corporate projects that threaten to deplete local fresh water supplies in order to provide (short-lived) profits for investors.<br />Yet, Barlow and Clarke show that schemes to transfer control to corporations are often promoted by the World Bank and other institutions that champion multinational capital investments. This should not be too surprising, as water infrastructures are not unlike other publicly-held assets that have become favorite targets of the investment community (disguised under the banner of \\"deregulation\\") in recent years.<br />While making a compelling case that growing corporate influence can only make a bad situation worse, the authors spend several chapters discussing how people can begin to constructively address the situation and turn it around for the better. These sections in particular are thoughtful and are obviously written by persons who have spent a great amount of time on this issue. Far from being merely a \\"screed\\" (as the reviewer from the pro-business Cahner's reviews claimed), I found the author's thoughts in these later chapters to be mature, balanced, and humane. Water, as a necessity for life, might indeed be the one issue that unites people around issues of social, economic and environmental justice.<br />I highly recommend this book for readers interested in learning more about an issue that will undoubtedly become increasingly important in the future.essity for life, might indeed be the one issue that unites people around issues of social, economic and environmental justice. <br />I highly recommend this book for readers interested in learning more about an issue that will undoubtedly become increasingly important in the future.	2002-05-27

In contast to what many here in the U.S. might perceive as the conventional wisdom, Shiva makes a strong argument that local, small scale agriculture is superior to the agribusiness model for a number of reasons.<br />First, Shiva points out that many of the productivity gains attributable to the Green Revolution were achieved by dramatically increased inputs of fertilizer, seed and water. When one compares units of input with units of output, however, native practices produce higher yields -- especially when one takes into account the multiple uses derived from a single product.<br />For example, mustard oil is a vital product used by many of India's poor for cooking, seasoning, medicine and other uses. But it has been banned by the Indian government (under highly suspicious circumstances) in order to allow imports of soybean oil products. While giant corporations benefit from expanded sales, native industries have been destroyed, contibuting to poverty and malnourishment.<br />Shiva discusses the commercial fishing and aquaculture (shrimp farming) practices that inevitably result in environmental destruction and reduced catches. She compares this short-sighted approach with traditional Indian fishing techniques that have successfully sustained themselves for generations while protecting important ecosystems such as mangrove forests.<br />Shiva discusses corporate patenting of seeds, which insidiously transforms the cooperative ethic of seed sharing into a criminal offense. The author supports a non-cooperation movement in India that is resisting corporate attempts to claim ownership of seeds that have been cultivated by countless generations of farmers.<br />Shiva's sacred cow / mad cow metaphor effectively and appropriately contrasts agribusiness with small farming. India's sacred cows live in harmony with the environment, performing multiple services and producing multiple products for the community; whereas mad cows are a grotesque manifestation of an industrial system obsessed with uniformity, technology and profit.<br />Shiva also touches on the topic of genetic engineering (GE) and discusses the threat it poses to biodiversity, food safety and human health.<br />The Afterword to the book alludes to the WTO protests in Seattle. Shiva believes this watershed event proves that people are becoming more aware of the dangers of unaccountable corporate power, yet she believes that positive change is possible. This opening of consciousness to new possibilities may be attributable to the extraordinary work of people like Vandana Shiva, whose intelligence and compassion is abundantly evident in this book.

As Bourdieu writes, his role as an intellectual is to &#34;critique...the [false] representations continuously produced and propagated by the dominant groups and their lackeys in the media&#34; (pg. 66) in order to expose the restorative nature (ie laissez-faire economics) of the neoliberal agenda. Bourdieu opposes those neoliberal pseudo-intellectuals who &#34;contribute to the maintenance of the symbolic order which is the condition of the functioning of the economic order&#34; (pg. 82).  Bourdieu's reasoned arguments for dignity and human rights will necessarilly stand in the way of the &#34;accountant's view of the world&#34; (pg. 105) that neoliberalism subscribes to.<br /><br />In a world where the the corporate media mostly serves as a conservative echo chamber, it is refreshing to read Bourdieu's intelligent yet sometimes bare-knuckled defense of people and society. Understanding both the value of high human cultural achievement and the threat of unchecked greed, Bourdieu spares no quarters when exposing those who aim to fill their pockets at the expense of the greater good.<br /><br />&#34;Acts of Resistance&#34; will help fix your moral compass and remind you that, in the end, it is people that matter most.

Centralized systems are associated with private for-profit capitalism whereas decentralized systems are typically managed by local community co-ops.<br />Shiva draws from her extensive knowledge of her native India to describe how centralized controls imposed during the colonial and post-colonial eras have largely failed to meet the needs of the people and the environment. She discusses how dams built with World Bank and other foreign dollars merely reallocated water resources at an enormous cost to the environment and to the many poor people displaced from their ancestral homes. The author also points out that modern pumps installed in the name of progress have unfortunately succeeded in withdrawing water at an unsustainable rate, thereby causing thousands of wells to run dry and consequently causing suffering for many.<br />On the other hand, Shiva relates cases where villagers have returned to native systems of water management that have succeeded in resuscitating wells, streams and rivers that had previously dried up. These projects are managed democratically by the villagers themselves with an eye towards sustainability and social justice (everyone gets their fair share of water but no one gets more water than necessary).<br />Shiva also gave the book a spiritual dimension. She cites both ancient and contemporary sources to prove that water holds special meaning to people the world over for its unique life-giving properties.  The implication is that it is perhaps immoral to regard water as merely the latest market opportunity. Clearly, respect for the natural environment and the needs of other people requires us to do better.<br />Water Wars is a great book for anyone who cares to learn more about water management issues and democracy.e requires us to do better. <br />Water Wars is a great book for anyone who cares to learn more about water management issues and democracy.	2002-05-09

McChesney lauds Chomsky for his many contributions to public understanding of how the economic system works and for whom, and for encouraging citizens to demand greater accountability from the unelected corporate elites.<br />Chapter one is a brief history of the modern world order.  Chomsky explains that protectionism has been often used by the U.S. and Britain to nurture their nascent industries to health and prosperity.  Yet, Chomsky points out that the dogma of \\"free trade\\" has been used to economically colonize weaker countries. For example, Great Britain helped impoverish India's citizens by enforcing trade restrictions, but the captive Indian market served to greatly enrich investors in Britain.<br />In Chapter two, Chomsky asserts that despite repeated attempts to condition the people to accept the neoliberal doctrine, opinion polls consistently show that people still believe in democratic principles such as fair levels of taxation, ample spending on public programs, etc. This article suggests that people cherish democractic ideals and therefore might have the capacity to successfully demand and win change -- even against entrenched corporate interests with far greater resources at their disposal.<br />Chapter three examines inconcistencies in U.S. policy with respect to free trade. Chomsky claims that Ronald Reagan was the most protectionist of all U.S. presidents (despite his rhetoric to the contrary). In short, the U.S. supports free trade when it is seen as a benefit but against it when foreigners have comparative advantage (such as when the Japanese automakers had superior high-mileage cars on the market in the early 1980s). Chomsky also discusses U.S. policy with Cuba. The author argues that the real motivation for the U.S. embargo is not to encourage democracy in Cuba but to stifle the appeal of Cuba's redistributive policies and prevent them from spreading to other countries.<br />Chapter four examines U.S. policy throughout the hemisphere. Chomsky reveals a consistent pattern of preference for protecting the rights of investors and repressing the human rights of citizens in countries that dare to opt for greater democracy.<br />In Chapter five, Chomsky links the Zapatista rebellion in Chiapas, Mexico with the declining living standards wrought by unregulated corporate access to third world resources and labor markets.<br />Chapter six discusses the MAI agreement. Chomsky stresses that this misguided treaty was negotiated in secret in order not to alarm democratic populations of the treaty's overt favortism to private capital over people and the environment.<br />The seventh and final article was written after the MAI proposal was defeated by concerned citizens groups, who made the secret text of the proposal public using the Internet. Chomsky cites this victory as evidence that democracy is \\"the ultimate weapon\\" that can be used to protect the rights of the people. However, Chomsky warns that the people must be forever vigilant if we want to prevent further concentration of wealth and power in private corporations.<br />Throughout, Chomsky ties his lessons back to the Founding Fathers to show how far our country has strayed from its original ideals. Whether you agree or disagree with the conclusions drawn, Profit Over People should at least give readers pause to consider the state of our democracy and what might be required to fix it.

I quickly realized that Barber's analysis was both prophetic and relevant to our current crisis.<br />In essence, Barber demonstrates that what we consider to be good in the industrialized world -- specifically, an ever-expanding capitalist, consumerist lifestyle -- is viewed with deadly suspicion by many in the non-industrialized world. That's because the wholesale acceptance of our culture is perceived by many of the world's poor as a threat to their traditional lifestyles.<br />The author points out that capitalism originally took root and flourished because of Western democracy's ability to curb the excesses of unfettered profit-making. But today's multinational corporations are no longer restrained by democratic forces in many parts of the third world. There, capitalism works in the name of absentee investors as a predatory force, stripping communities of their material and cultural resources, creating a branded, homogenous \\"McWorld\\" that too often leaves multitudes of impoverished people in its wake.<br />Such conditions breed anger and resentment against Westerners in general and often against the American symbols of global capitalism in particular. In the worst case scenarios, negative energy is manifested by terrorism. So as the multinationals connect the world more closely together with sophisticated communications and production systems, \\"tribal units\\" such as terrorist organizations strive at the same time to tear this world apart.<br />Somehow, \\"global democracy\\" needs to catch up with economic globalisation, the author reasons, to secure a more stable \\"global civil society\\".  Such a world should more equitably balance the needs of people with capitalism. Barber believes that if people were truly empowered as citizens they could reshape their communities to better serve their own needs. In the end, this would effectively diminish the attractiveness of joining in the ultimately self-destructive world of \\"Jihad\\".<br />Furthermore, the long-term growth of capitalism itself also requires stable markets. Barber points out that unless we more equitably share the benefits of capitalism with so-called emerging market countries, the instabilities that are created will eventually undermine our own success too.<br />As policy makers struggle to learn how we can prevent another attack from happening, we would do well to consider the intelligent analysis in this outstanding book.s of joining in the ultimately self-destructive world of \\"Jihad\\". <br />Furthermore, the long-term growth of capitalism itself also requires stable markets.

His sharp prose is a welcome and needed antidote to the incoherent soundbites and superficial analyses masquerading as serious journalism in today's vapid media culture (especially on TV).<br />As the spoiled brat son of wealth and privilege, it is perhaps fitting that George W. Bush was put into the highest office of the land by the sort of anti-democractic shenanagans that once upon a time were deployed only in banana republics (or did we just get another taste of this last week in Venezuela?). Miller suggests that Bush benefited both overtly and covertly from a coalition of right-wing factions who, frustrated with the absence of the communist boogie-man, have channeled their considerable energies towards the destruction of their hated \\"liberal\\" compatriots (even if -- or especially because -- the left's point of view is vaguely understood by GOP true believers).<br />Miller's book is a wake up call to the citizens of the U.S. If you are a Leftist, you might find it exhilarating to read words that for much too long were left unwritten. If you are a Conservative, you are challenged to read this book to learn more about the real George W. Bush and the agenda you are supporting. In either case, I think most people who read this book will agree with Miller's assertion that our democracy is currently situated in a very precarious place. The author stresses that the vast majority of us should be very concerned with the issue of balancing the rights of average citizens with the exponentially-expanding power of the privileged few.nentially-expanding power of the privileged few.	2002-04-20

Today, the exalted prophets of the so-called \\"free market\\" refuse to acknowledge capitalism's destructive impacts to the environment and human health and welfare by claiming that its ill effects are external to the profit imperative and are consequently of little or no concern.<br />In this insightful book, author John McMurty challenges the conventional wisdom. By comparing unregulated global capitalism with the uncontrolled growth of a malignant tumor, McMurty alerts us to the \\"life\\" and \\"death\\" sequences of money investment that today's market champions are unable to see.<br />The growth imperative has always meant that capital must find new opportunities to grow in order to sustain itself. But the author suggests that we have entered a post-Marxist era because capital investments have been almost completely de-linked from any trace of productive investment. The modern capitalist imperative is simply to create more money for idle investors by any means possible.<br />This growth is often enabled by predation on the publicly-held resources that the author argues represents real value, thereby diminishing the community's ability to sustain itself in the long run. Forests are clear-cut; public utilities are privatized; social programs are gutted; and so on. The net result is that the quality of life for the vast majority of the world's citizens has declined.<br />On the other hand, the \\"death sequences\\" of armaments, tobacco, oil, chemical, and other dangerous products reward investors with high rates of return. Currency trading -- with its sometimes destablizing effect on national economies -- is also cited by the author as symptomatic of a culture that does not know how to properly \\"immune\\" itself from predatory capitalism: is it not unreasonable to tax currency trades to discourage excess and to compensate society for its ill effects?<br />Full of insight and powerful analysis, this book is recommended for people who are not afraid to re-examine their basic assumptions about capitalism and learn more about the possibly dangerous direction in which our society appears to be headed.scourage excess and to compensate society for its ill effects? <br />Full of insight and powerful analysis, this book is recommended for people who are not afraid to re-examine their basic assumptions about capitalism and learn more about the possibly dangerous direction in which our society appears to be headed.	2002-04-13

The author very effectively answers the many critics who accused him of playing a \\"spoiler\\" role in the 2000 election.<br />With over 100 million non-voters in the U.S., Nader believes that there is ample opportunity for a third party to take root and grow. By aligning with the Green Party, Nader's vision is to nurture a movement that has not \\"surrendered\\" its values to corporate interests.<br />Nader is a grown-up who writes with insight and intelligence. He understands that some of his liberal friends were ultimately unwilling to support his campaign because of longstanding ties with the Democratic Party (and the attendant fear of tilting the election to George W. Bush). But Nader's counter argument sticks: a healthy democracy demands a citizenry that is willing to vote its conscience. He drives the point home by highlighting the fact that the Democrats have become increasingly pro-business and almost indistinguishable from the Republicans in recent years (Nader also included a section in the appendix on this subject), meaning that many progressive ideas have been stuck on the shelves for far too long. Nader compelling argues that the American people deserve better.<br />On the other hand, the personal pain is writ fairly large when Nader recalls how certain so-called friends -- many of whom collaborated with Nader on projects in the past -- actually went so far as to misrepresent his ideas in order to harm his campaign and get Al Gore elected. One would think that such behavior is uncalled for under any circumstances, but to knowingly slander a man who has arguably done more for the American people over the past 40 years than any other single person, and for whom principles mean a great deal, is disgraceful. I applaud Nader for using this book to set the record straight.<br />Yet despite what was obviously a very physically, financially and emotionally draining experience (Nader's futile attempts to get on the Presidential debates must have been very challenging), Nader emerges as a class act. He is proud of what the campaign was able to achieve, and he encourages others to participate in the democractic process too.<br />\\"Crashing the Party\\" is recommended reading for anyone with a keen interest in Ralph Nader, the Green Party or the 2000 election.motionally draining experience (Nader's futile attempts to get on the Presidential debates must have been very challenging), Nader emerges as a class act.

While I anticipated that the author might discuss worker exploitation, the unscrupulous use of advertising to target young children, and the connection between obesity and fast food, the book delivered far more than that.  I was alarmed to learn about the terrible conditions that prevail on the production side as well (such as independent farmers becoming the pawns of large agribusiness corporations, and the unsafe and unsanitary conditions that exist in many slaughterhouses and packinghouses).  It seems that we may all be at risk consuming the contaminated beef that is routinely produced by the industry.<br />On the other hand, it was heartening to learn about In-N-Out, a fast food chain that pays decent wages and serves higher quality food at a competitive price. The author cites it as evidence that the McDonald's model is not inevitable. Indeed, Schlosser believes that the over reliance on technology and uniformity that made McDonald's a market leader in the 20th century may ultimately turn out to be a losing strategy in the 21st century.<br />Schlosser's book has convinced me to quit supporting this industry until it cleans up its act. I encourage you to read the book and make up your own mind.	2002-03-19

Yet, many people have resisted the adoption of these technologies (mainly in Europe but increasingly in the U.S.). Do these protests have validity?<br />This excellent book convincingly argues that Yes, the public should be concerned about GE. Its 31 essays are written by an assortment of knowledgeable but concerned scientists and activists. Some of them are ex-industry insiders who clearly understand the technical issues involved. These writers resoundingly dispel the industry's usual claim that GE dissenters are uninformed neo-Luddites.<br />It is clear that the biotech industry exists principally to make money for its investors. Statements about making the world a better place are, in fact, little more than a public relations smoke screen but have been effective in that it gives cover for politicians and regulators who must approve much of what the industry does.<br />It is a bit surprising that most people are not more concerned about the ownership of life forms (including human DNA) by private companies. To date, this has mostly affected farmers who are impelled to buy patent-protected seed, but in the future it may have profound implications for most people too. Several essays drill into this particular topic in detail, and are eye-opening.<br />Other articles focus on the many serious technical concerns that exist, such as the threat of cross-pollination. It is alarming to learn that companies such as Monsanto push aggressively to get new products approved, despite evidence that they may be dangerous.<br />The book also suggests common sense solutions to many of the problems that the biotech industry claims to be solving. For example, instead of growing GE pigs to produce replacement human body parts, why not simply encourage more people to participate in organ donor programs? If participation rates were increased in the U.S. to levels comparable to some other places in the world, there would be no shortage.<br />If you want to be better informed about the vitally important topic of GE, I strongly encourage you to read this book.f participation rates were increased in the U.S. to levels comparable to some other places in the world, there would be no shortage. <br />If you want to be better informed about the vitally important topic of GE, I strongly encourage you to read this book.	2002-03-06

The author reveals many alarming facts about climate change, falling water tables, and the stressed biological base.  The author builds a solid case that the earth will not be able to support the current throw-away lifestyle indefinitely, and that attempts to extend this short-term mentality to the third world are pointless.<br />The second section discusses the &quot;new economy&quot;.  Here, Brown contrasts green technologies with the status quo, including: wind, solar and hydrogen power vs. fossil fuels; recycling vs. mining; sustainable forestry vs. clear cutting; raising water productivity vs. depleting aquifers; mass transit vs. automobiles; and more.  In each instance, the author makes a compelling case why it makes economic as well as environmental sense for society to switch to environmental-friendly solutions.<br />In the last section, Brown shows us how to get &quot;from here to there&quot;. While he acknowledges that entrenched economic interests will fight to avoid change, the author writes confidently because he knows that change MUST occur.  Brown points out that if humanity does not have the foresight to choose the sustainable path today, the environmental catastrophes we are creating for ourselves will eventually force us to change tomorrow.<br />He goes on to write about common-sense public and private sector policies that could be used to help effect the transition to an &quot;eco-economy&quot; in a fair and reasonable manner. The author is optimistic in that he believes environmental collapse is not inevitable.  He cites evidence that new practices are in fact being implemented in many places, albeit in a piecemeal and inadequate fashion. What's missing is the large-scale, coordinated effort needed to reverse the current situation, which will require consensus among leaders in industry and government.<br />Brown's message is sane, articulate and persuasive.  Let's hope that the message in this excellent book is heeded sooner rather than later.overnment.<br />Brown's message is sane, articulate and persuasive.

Why are balance sheets constructed to highlight the rate of return from a shareholder perspective only?  The author points out that accounting practices could easily be changed to create a more balanced view of the company's value to society. It could measure things such as the value of its employees, the amount of financial support corporations may have siphoned off the public trust, the depletion of natural capital, etc.<br />Kelly explains that such exercises are rarely taken because shareholders make infinite demands on capital, in much the way that Monarchs declared perpetual domain over land and people in an earlier time. The author refers to writings by Jefferson and other revolutionaries to support her case that the colonists were concerned about limiting the power of corporations even while they were struggling to overthrow the King: corporate charters were usually awarded during this era for limited time periods and were often revoked when companies misbehaved.<br />Regrettably, corporations later used their power to petition the courts and eventually claimed status as &quot;persons&quot;, leading to numerous abuses of power (such as the relatively recent argument that corporate campaign contributions are equivalent to free speech and are therefore protected); these abuses unfairly skew the democratic process in favor of big money.  This is just one of many reasons why Kelly believes that citizens must reclaim their rights and cast off the corporate aristocracy.<br />Could it be that in the wake of the Enron scandal -- which so compellingly shows how deeply corporate money and political power are connected -- the people will demand the kind of change that Kelly advocates?  If so, they would do well to consider some of the ideas in this outstanding book.hat citizens must reclaim their rights and cast off the corporate aristocracy. <br />Could it be that in the wake of the Enron scandal -- which so compellingly shows how deeply corporate money and political power are connected -- the people will demand the kind of change that Kelly advocates?

US	52736752	RBWETT6YOQZQI	0674006712	431315804	Empire	Books	5	13	14	N	N	Imagine there's no empire	\\"Empire\\" is an ambitious book. Readers who approach this work with an open mind will be rewarded with numerous insights and a keener understanding of the world in which we live.<br /><br />Reading the book is like being invited to listen to a dialogue between two great thinkers. One can sense the paragraphs that may have been written by the philosopher Michael Hardt from among those by the political scientist Antonio Negri. You are fascinated by the manner in which the exchange of ideas seems to create a kind of intellectual synergy, which in turn leads us to deeper and more penetrating analyses of the subject matter. It would be interesting to learn how the authors communicated with each other (Hardt is in the U.S. and Negri was in prison in Italy) to achieve this remarkable feat.<br /><br />The book is divided into four sections. It may be helpful to look at each individually to better undestand why opinions about this book seem to vary so widely.<br /><br />The first section on \\"Political Constitution\\" disscuses the characteristics of the empire dominating our postmodern world. The authors discuss the declining power of nation states and the increasing power of multinational corporations along with the institutions that regulate them (such as the IMF, UN, WTO etc.). The authors contend that the requirements of capital have created juridical norms that have literally enveloped all regions of the world, meaning that there is no longer an \\"outside\\" to the globalized capitalist regime.<br /><br />Importantly, the authors draw on Michel Foucault's theories to describe the transformation from the \\"disciplinary society\\" in the imperialist era to the \\"society of control\\" in the current era of globalization. The term \\"biopower\\" is used to describe how the empire's values have become internalized by the multitude, allowing control to be exercised through the self-regulating actions of individuals participating in the market economy. On the other hand, Hardt and Negri contend that biopower may hold the key to the multitude's liberation from capitalism, an idea that is introduced here but is more fully developed out later in the book.<br /><br />Section two on \\"Passages of Sovereignty\\" traces the rise of modernity and the state. This section has seven chapters and could almost be regarded as an excellent book-within-the-book. The topics discussed in this section include the emergence of the state and its relationship with the Enlightenment; the state's role in mobilizing citizens for capitalist production and war; the importance of slave labor to capitalism in Europe and the New World; and much more.<br /><br />Hardt and Negri's concept of \\"network power\\" that is embedded within the U.S. constitution was particularly interesting. The authors contend that by locating power within the productive capacity of the citizens, the U.S. is uniquely capable of projecting capitalist power world-wide. However, they contend that this power is \\"imperial\\" (but not \\"imperialist\\") in that it primarily serves the interests of capital but not the state and its citizens. While some may take issue with the authors on this point, I believe that the prevalence of corporate tax scams, oil wars, trade agreements with non-existant labor standards and the like suggests that the authors may be on to something.<br /><br />The third section is titled \\"Passages of Production\\". Again, this extended section containing six chapters could almost be read as an independent work. Here, the authors draw heavily on Marx to discuss how society has responded to changing economic conditions. I found these chapters to be extremely well-written, offering concise and powerful analyses that helped me gain a new level of understanding. A few of the topics discussed include the importance of the New Deal in resolving the \\"crisis of imperialism\\" manifested by the Great Depression and intra-capitalist war; the socio-political dynamics that led to postcolonial resistance in Vietnam andelsewhere; the emergence of world markets; and more.<br /><br />Central to Hardt and Negri's analysis are the enormous cultural changes of the 1960s. The authors state that the desire for personal liberation and freedom from the Fordist \\"factory-society\\" led to a profound restructuring of the \\"social mode of production\\" at that time. Capitalists in the west responded to this crisis by privileging information technology and implementing more flexible, decentralized and inclusive forms of management. However, the Soviet Union's inability to abandon the disciplinary regime and its rigid, centralized management structure hampered it from successfully making a similar transition.<br /><br />Hardt and Negri's description of the postmodern world seems familiar. Most people have economic power and productive freedom but limited political power; the media produces entertaining \\"spectacle\\" but also perpetuates \\"superstitution\\" and inculcates \\"fear\\" of poverty; pockets of wealth have appeared in poor countries but the poor are increasingly visible in wealthy nations; and so on. While many of these observations have been stated elsewhere, the author's ability to tie these symptoms of globalization to their root causes is masterful and makes for compelling reading.<br /><br />Section four is about the \\"Decline and Fall of Empire\\". In the spirit of Marx, Hardt and Negri hope to show how the times we live in may be different from past eras and therefore hold the potential for revolutionary change. While I think that the case was convincingly made that the empire as the authors have defined it is indeed a new phenomenon, I was not convinced that the evolution to a society that Saint Francis of Assisi might endorse must necessarilly follow.<br /><br />Hardt and Negri return to the concept of biopower -- which might also be understood as their updated version of Marx's concept of class consciousness -- to make their case. The authors believe that the unprecendented mixing of people and ideas has enabled an \\"ontological human dimension\\" of biopower that is naturally people-centered, peaceful, and loving. Biopower will eventually realize its material existence when people coopt the means of production (especially information technology) and \\"cast off\\" the violent apparatus of empire in favor of brotherhood, or a state of non-government. In the end, the authors have imagined a world that slightly resembles a John Lennon song: a borderless world with income and resources available to all.<br /><br />Whether one agrees with the authors' beautiful vision of the future, I think that this book easily deserves a 5 star rating. With hundreds of pages packed with outstanding research and an uncanny ability to synthesize a variety of sources into an unique vision, this book will no doubt stimulate thinking people for many years to come.elsewhere; the emergence of world markets; and more.<br /><br />Central to Hardt and Negri's analysis are the enormous cultural changes of the 1960s.

He argues that capitalism's crisis is marked by an oversupply of capital desperately seeking investment opportunities in a world possessing a limited supply of secure, profit-producing activities.<br />The author has written an unique and insightful economic history of the post-WW II world, tracing many contemporary problems back to their root causes and exposing official explanations as propaganda. For example, the privatization of state assets has been aggressively promoted principally because they provide new homes for investment dollars -- not necessarilly because the private sector can more efficiently run these enterprises (which in fact they often can not).<br />Shutt suggests that the industrial economies have created an untenable situation for themselves.  Public debt has been increased in order to prop up asset values (witness the Savings and Loan bank bail-out in the U.S. and other corporate welfare policies), making it difficult for governments to invest in either their own infrastructures or third world governments. This means that the world economy can not grow at a fast enough pace to satisfy the needs of private capital. Eventually, the oversupply of capital will lead to a crash in asset values.<br />Events that have occurred after the book's publication suggest that the author was on the mark. The Internet stock investment mania and its subsequent collapse illustrates how desperately capital latches onto any opportunity that might promise above-average profits, however risky it may actually be.<br />Shutt finishes the book with an outline of what the world might look like following a crash of the present system. The author suggests that an institution such as the European Union (or more precisely, an expanded and modified version of the E.U.) could be used to manage a more just and equitable system: namely one that balances the needs of labor, environment and capital, with primacy given to local, sustainable business enterprises that are fully accountable to the public.<br />This is a highly readable and stimulating book.  Anyone with an interest in contemporary political economy should enjoy it.labor, environment and capital, with primacy given to local, sustainable business enterprises that are fully accountable to the public.<br />This is a highly readable and stimulating book.

The author shreds the techno-booster utopian visions of theorists such as Alvin Toffler to expose today's information society for what it really represents: namely, a post-Fordist attempt by capital to deepen and extend its dominance, control and repression as never before.<br /><br />Mr. Dyer-Witheford presents evidence that the information infrastructure used to coordinate global production and consumption chains might also provide subversive opportunities to the disenfranchised, who may ultimately choose to develop new social structures existing beyond the control of capital. In this manner, the author believes that the surplus value produced by machines could be used to institute a guaranteed wage, a communication commons, and a revived democracy.<br /><br />On the other hand, Mr. Dyer-Witheford acknowledges that technology might be used by fascists to spread hate and intolerance, and cautions us that this possibility should not be taken lightly. As the social costs of capitalism increase for ever larger segments of the world's population, it is possible that an under-educated public may be led by self-serving leaders to turn violently against themselves. The author's optimism that people will choose to strive for peace and justice, however, distinguishes his work from the pessimistic tone that sometimes suffuses the work of other postmodernists and contemporary European Marxist scholars.<br /><br />Mr. Dyer-Whitheford's cogent analysis provides clarity to readers seeking insight into the dynamics of post-industrial society. Let's hope that this important work gets the attention it deserves and provides guidance to those who may be wish to build a more humane and just society. Highly recommended.	2001-08-19

The authors explain that the media system has come to be dominated by a few large corporations who use their market powers largely to promote a world-wide monoculture of consumerism. The media companies do this by distributing non-controversial entertainment and infotainment programs. This strategy is funded by multinational corporations wishing to sell their products to ever-expanding markets and supported by the elite classes who benefit the most from capitalist growth. The commercial media companies use their control of broadcast network systems to limit access to alternative materials (especially local content celebrating diversity and alternative, non-capitalist values), forcing consumers to accept the paradox of choice within a narrowly-defined range of possibilities. Meanwhile, as public broadcasting systems falter, the authors point out that citizens who are immersed in commercial media gradually embrace the values of selfish individualism and materialism and tend to disengage from their local communities.<br />With thorough documentation and clear, persuasive analysis, Herman and McChesney dissect the defenders of media globalization and commercialization and explain why democratic alternatives to the corporate media system are critical to maintaining a healthy democracy. Highly recommended.	2000-11-16

In free societies, Carey explains that more subtle means are used to keep populations under control. Specifically, propaganda is used to ensure that most people will think in a manner that is consistent with the corporate agenda (such as belief in the free market and business' right to unlimited profit).  Carey documents how Americans and Australians have been subjected to corporate propaganda during most of the 20th Century, and explains how these efforts have perverted our democracy (for example, American's over willingness to fight communists, real or imagined, to protect capitalism).  Indeed, while many Americans were conditioned during the Cold War to believe that propaganda existed only in the Soviet Union, China and other communist regimes, Carey persuasively argues that propaganda actually played (and continues to play) a more critical role in molding the attitudes of citizens in democracies.	2000-10-06

As our environment deteriorates,  the author documents and analyzes the dialogue between those who plunder  natural resources and those who are working to protect our planet.  Importantly, the root cause of environmental destruction -- the divide  between rich and poor -- is mostly overlooked, the author writes.
