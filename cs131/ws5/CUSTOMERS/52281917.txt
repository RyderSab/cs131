US	52281917	R1V1TQNBAHXX4S	0151007640	240499638	Crabwalk	Books	5	3	6	N	Y	An important, wonderful read........	Every so often I am very pleased to find myself in the middle of a novel that is a pleasure to read. This is Crabwalk. Grass' narrative voice is intimate, and although he makes frequent, apologetic references to the 'scuttling' back and forth in his storyline, the story is actually very readable.<br />Yes, simply as an historical account of a tragic event, especially his description of the actual sinking of the ship is riveting. Yet, so is the unfolding of the tragic relationship between father and son...the sense of loss, and of history repeating itself....a main theme in the story.<br />Fantastic. Highly recommended.	2003-09-06
US	52281917	R1U1WKX3P6ZT1M	0679439382	39256491	The Little Friend	Books	2	6	7	N	N	great character description lost in a pointless plot	I don't know whether to be angry that I wasted so much time reading 500+ pages in hopes of reaching a satisfying end, or disappointed that the promise of terrific character description dead-ended as if the author just got up and left the book...<br />And that is the way it feels, as if the author had grown tired of her characters and rather than giving the story a resolution  that made sense, simply staged a 'big event' with an implausible outcome, typed &quot;The End&quot; and sent it off to her publisher.<br />I believe this is why readers are posting such negative reviews....there is so much potential here. The descriptions of the South are lush and, if a bit overblown in places, also full of promise of where the story might have gone with more time and care.<br />Yet, in the second half of the book numerous story threads are simply dropped and the main impetus of the story, the revenge and justice theme becomes nullified and distorted to such an extent that I had more empathy for 'the bad guys' than the leading character, who simply became annoying.<br />As a reader, I feel cheated....which makes me sad, because Ms. Tartt is clearly a very talented author..... I don't know if she just lost interest in this book, and if she did, why her editor or agent didn't encourage her to persevere with the ending (f not out of respect for the time and money the readers have spent on the book, at least with an eye to maintaining the built-in market she had for the book based on fans of &quot;The Secret History&quot;), I would have gladly read another 100 pages for a more cohesive conclusion...either way, it's the reader that has been given short shrift. And I'm not sure if the author cares.	2003-08-25

And yet, when I reached the final page, I really wished there was more to read.....that I could continue to follow Ruth and Harry as they embark on their new marriage, or Eddie and Marion as they continue their unusual, but loving relationship, or even to see what Hannah would do in the midst of all these seemingly happy relationships.<br />This is just a big wonderful book, which is full of funny scenes and some very sad ones as well.<br />It is also a book which will be very appealing to people who love to read, as there are great quotes from the classics, Irving shows his appreciation for readers. He also gives us a very interesting insight into different types of authors and their varying degrees of success and what that means to their lives.<br />I really just loved this book.....and have raved about it so much that I'm giving a copy of it to one of my friends tomorrow and another friend is already waiting to read it next.	2003-01-12

I believe that good literature can often provide a deeper understanding of the implications of history and political/philosophical ideas....<br />Animal Farm is an easy to read fable which quickly conveys how the most well intentioned ideas can be turned into a means of social slavery in the hands of the wrong people (as they say,'absolute power corrupts absolutely')who coddle and finally coerce gullible followers.....a lesson on the vital importance of real democracy and the need for literacy at every level of society.<br />So read the book, and save your hide.

Once again Julia Cameron has written a book that will inspire and comfort anyone in pursuit of a dream, creative or not.<br />I say that because I know that her books are often targetted to artists, however, I find them just as useful for anyone undertaking a new endeavor, for instance, an entreprenuer would greatly appreciate what she has to say about perserverance and moving forward despite fear or obstacles.<br />The book is broken into weekly 'sessions' which each have a focus or theme. In each section are guided excercises meant to help you explore the idea and used in conjunction with her famous 'Morning Pages' the book can be a great service to helping one focus and get to work on accomplishing a goal.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-12-30

Granted, I am forty years old....most begin reading JA when they are girls, but I am happy to say that my advanced age did not spoil my enjoyment of the novel.<br />Jane Austen is a superb storyteller with a wonderful sense of humor and insight into the social conventions of her era and the timeless and often humorous relations between men and women.<br />By the time I finished the last page and saw Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy happily married, I sighed and then immediately picked up another Jane Austen novel to read....and intend to continue doing so until I've read all of her novels and hopefully the biography by Carol Shields.<br />Other reviewers will tell you more about the plot....I want to convey the enjoyment you will recieve by reading Jane Austen. Yes there are happy endings....but there is also a lively social satire, conveyed through dialogue and narration, and writing that is beautifully crafted into plots that keep you turning the pages. So start with Pride and Prejudice....and begin a life-long love affair with a great author.	2002-12-30

Northanger Abbey is a lighthearted, sweet, satire....<br />This is only my second Jane Austen novel, I read Pride and Prejudice before this, and while NA doesn't have the substance of P&amp;P, it is no less entertaining.<br />The story deals with the familiar Austen themes of social mores and the pursuit of a suitable husband, but in this novel it receives a fun and lively treatment which will keep you turning the pages, by turns rooting for and laughing at Catherine, swooning over Henry, and cheering when Isabella gets her just desserts!<br />I maybe the only woman to read Jane Austen for the first time at the age of forty, but I can't wait to read everything else she's written.....I've already bought them all.

I always through Tolstoy was my favorite author in terms of character development.....but it's clear to me that Mahfouz is equally talented in rendering characters that seem as real as friends.<br />I cannot wait to read more by this important author!	2002-08-25

It is incredibly readable, lovely to get lost in, time flies by while you're reading it. His characters are so richly drawn, his ancedotes about each one are filling and often funny. I only wish that a translation by Pevear and Volokhonsky were available as they bring a fresh modern voice to translation (I can't wait to read their translation of Anna K. and 'The Idiot' by Dostoevsky).<br />So why am I writing a review of W&P if I've just started it? Well, first to share the fun I'm having and encourage others to give this great book a try.....and to invite others who have read the book or are reading it to write to me and share your comments. One of the best things about writing reviews on Amazon.com is that I occasionally hear from other reviewers or readers with comments on my reviews or recommendations of their own.....and I love it.<br />And I love Tolstoy! I think he's the best writer in the world. Although....quite honestly, the most memorable literary passage I've ever read was found in Dostoevsky's \\"Crime and Punishment\\". But you'll have to write to me to find out which one I'm referring to!<br />Happy reading!	2002-05-27

I picked this up in Dubai and started reading one story.....just to pass the time in my hotel room.....and then I couldn't put it down until I'd finished the entire book.<br />I am not a big reader of short stories, prefering the longer journey of the novel. However, Ms. Lahiri is such a gifted writer I will gladly read anything she comes out with next.<br />The magic of this collection of stories is in how well drawn her characters are...she brings them to life, you understand their motivations, their choices, their story.....you don't feel as if they and you are simply being manipulated for the sake of a clever plot line the author wants to try out.<br />In fact, most of the stories are not exotic, outlandish, mawkish stories.....they are vignettes from everyday life. Observations of ordinary people whose ordinary lives become sweet and memorable under the careful scrutiny of the author. The lasting impression is a greater appreciation of our lives and the stories we live from day to day.<br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough.	2002-04-13

I found it terribly unsatisfying....perhaps because I am a romantic and had hoped for something more along those lines.<br />That said. As a whole I loved the book for its wonderful writing, challenging to read at times, but a unique and interesting voice that seemed to suit the characters and the plot. I haven't read anything else by this author so I can't compare it with her other works, but I am intrigued enough to pick up another of her novels in the future.<br />What works in the novel is the exploration of the clash of cultures that infiltrates a love relationship between two people of very disparate backgrounds, and the differing motivations they bring to their relationship. Do they ultimately both get what they wanted? Some would argue yes, even in the end. I just would have preferred the storybook happy ending. But that's my cultural and romantic bias.	2002-04-13

It is a sweet, simple story about following your dream. Something which I feel not enough people do in their own lives.<br />I was especially gratified that the author doesn't delude us with the lie that once you decide to embark on the journey it's all going to be a simple skip down a rose strewn path.....we are shown and told the many obstacles that follow the \\"beginners luck\\" that comes with the initial commitment to many dreams.<br />And as I said.....it's a sweet story. Memorable, even. So read it, give it to friends. It won't hurt you....in fact, I believe it's a book you'll recall often with fond memories.	2002-04-13

I'd love to sit down and have a conversation with Mr. Mahfouz, just for the pleasure of listening to such a brilliant writer talk about his thoughts behind the story.<br />This book drew me in from the first page with its evocative picture of a wife waking in the middle of the night to wait for her husband's return from his nightly habit of entertainment. From this first scene we are told volumes about her character, her motivations and given our first glimpse of the powerful patriarch that both inspires admiration and fear from every member of his family.<br />This is a family saga, but it is also a stirring portrait of a country living under \\"occupation\\" by foreign forces and the struggle for independence that ultimately brings tragedy to the family.<br />I can't wait to read the next two volumes and other novels by this wonderful author.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-04-13

This is the third Lehane book I've read....although it's actually the first in the series.<br />In this book, Lehane does a wonderful job of not only dumping us right into the mystery and then dragging us along like panting mutts until the very last page.....he also manages to introduce well-rounded, interesting characters, especially Kenzie, the protagonist. Okay, the love interest between Gennero and Kenzie isn't that scintilating....or credible, they make better partners in crime than romance....but quite frankly, I think romance would get in the way of the story being told in this type of book.<br />In Kenzie, he has captured the complexity of a flawed, but intelligent and compassionate PI who in his fairminded way would as easily put a bullet through the middle of your chest as throw himself in the path of a bullet intended for you, depending on how he felt justice was best served. Lehane's wit makes his dialogue sizzle and you find yourself cheering when the bad guys finally get theirs in the final chapters.<br />Frankly, I can't wait to read every book in the series as well as everything else that Lehane writes. His books are enormously satisfying. And speaking as one who has already read two of his other books......he only gets better with each one!	2001-11-23

Ethan Frome is short enough to be read in one sitting, and is probably best enjoyed in one sitting. It portrays a turning point in the lives of three people, a married couple and the young attractive woman who has come to live with them.<br />The novel covers only a few days in their lives, but captures the sad suffocating life, the way in which their weakness traps them into making decisions which instead of freeing them, will further ensnare them.<br />The beauty of the novel comes in the portrayal of the characters and the town that they inhabit. The language Ms. Wharton uses is lovely and heavy, perfectly suited to her characters and their ultimate downfall.<br />This is the first book I've read by Edith Wharton, but I'm now looking forward to reading &quot;Summer&quot; and &quot;House of Mirth&quot;. Although the author seems to specialize in unhappy endings....her writing is so good, you'll keep coming back for more.	2001-11-03

At first blush, there would be a few who might say, &quot;well we don't read that much now...we get most of our information from tv, our entertainment from movies, or our computers.&quot; But it's more than that if you really stop to consider that when you choose to pick up a book of YOUR choosing your are excercising not only a basic intellectual freedom, you are also exerting your privacy, your right to choose how you'll spend your time, and how you'll choose to look at the world.<br />Bradbury considers all of these things and the choices one man decided to make as a consequence. What was so exciting for me was to be able to contemplate these ideas within the context of a story told with beautiful language and images and a story that will grab you until the very end.<br />I know this book is one of those that gets assigned in high school and then never sees the light of day afterward......well, as an ancient 40-year-old, I think that's a shame. It's a great read no matter what your age.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-10-30

I picked this book up when I was having a bad day....and miserable thoughts about the novel I was working on. Within a few pages, I felt better. The novel is still bothering me...but I feel less anxious about it.<br />The reason is that Maisel is very good at dispensing realistic, sensible advice. Facing a problem? Keep writing. Want to know if you'll ever be published? Keep writing. Want to get better? Keep writing. That's the gist of his message.....only he does it a lot better than I do.<br />Each chapter in the book addresses a different stage or facet of a writer's life. In his introduction he writes &quot;This book is meant to accompany you through a lifetime of writing.&quot; And I believe that's quite an accurate description of the value and audience of the book...<br />...Maisel demystifies a lot of jargon and pretentious suppositions for the beginner....the one who wants to write, but is too intimidated to get started (Maisel will tell you to just start!). The book is also full of very practical advice, for instance, he offers some terrific role playing excercises on how to find an agent and what to say to one once you do, or why you should or shouldn't attend a writer's conference...<br />For the career writer, who's reached a crossroads or a block, or just needs a breath of fresh air...Maisel offers encouragement, and perspective, as well as essays from other writers at various stages in their careers on such topics as whether or not to pursue an MFA, when to re-think or abandon a project that's underway.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-10-23

I've just finished a book you might like...ALI AND NINO by &quot;Kuban Said&quot; a nom de plume of a Jewish man from Baku who converted to Islam in his youth.<br />A&amp;N was written during the 30's, and published psuedonomously because the author's Jewish identity was discovered by the Germans while he was living in Berlin.

Very well done.<br />In light of current events...this novel may provide insight into a culture and worldview that is quite different than that of the Christian American/European view that we are used to.<br />Sometimes fiction can convey important truths more easily than non-fiction.	2001-10-21

I'm thinking of the final scene of the book.......Brezinski describes the flood of expats crowding the airport, jumping on the first plane out, like it was the last plane out of Saigan, and I bet his housekeeper was laughing her head off as she flipped through the channels on the TV he donated out of guilt or because it was too heavy to take with him, or as she snuggled into the fur coat Brezinski's wife probably left behind in a fit of political correctness.<br />I was in Kiev in '94 and '97....and a great deal of what he's written about Moscow was evident in Kiev, on a smaller scale. I believe Brezinski has done an admirable job of presenting the wild west style of business that was fostered by investment bankers looking for a superlative return on their investment and the Russians who saw a good thing and knew how to play it. However, what probably sickens some readers is the arrogance of the American &quot;let us show you how it's done&quot; attitude that pervades the book.<br />While Brezinski is describing the high life he lived with his friends......I wonder if he ever had a moment where he wondered about the lesser life lived by his housekeeper....about the costs of the oligarch's theft of companies. And the part played by investment banks who were willing to look the other way when dealing with the oligarch's as long as their return on investment was high enough.<br />Sure, I enjoyed the voyeristic pleasure of watching the expats live it up.....as much as Brezinski. But I wish he'd balanced his work with a view of the social costs of the &quot;experiment&quot;.<br />At the end of his book, as he recounts the mass exodus of expats, it would have done him well to look over his shoulder at the Russians who were laughing........	2001-10-17

Jon Krakauer wrote this book before his even more celebrated book, &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; about the failed Everest expedition. Both books are notable, not only for the thrilling adventures they recount but for how well written they are.<br />Not only does Krakauer make you feel as if you are in the shoes of his subject, he also makes you feel as if you are in their head...he does an excellent job of looking into the motivations of the people he is writing about and why they are drawn to what are dangerous or even eccentric pursuits.<br />I read his original article in Outside magazine about McCandleless and like so many others, was touched, saddened, mystified and probably a little pissed off that a young man, so intelligent would choose such a stupid way to find himself. Krakkauer does an admirable and sensitive job of looking for clues in the lives of other adventurers and in the journals that McCandleless left behind. He takes us to the people that met and were touched by McCandleless during his two year journey that ultimately led him to that deserted bus in the middle of the woods in Alaska. Why McCandless chose to go into the wild so ill-prepared, we will never know. But the author has done as good a job as anyone in providing us with enough interviews and information to at least give us some ideas.<br />On a lighter note......I'll look forward to reading the next book by Jon Krakauer.	2001-10-10

This novel held my interest through to the end.....which is remarkable since we know who is killed and by whom within pages of the start.<br />That the reader continues to read, through another 500 pages is testament to Tartt's skill in drawing us into the characters' lives, making them come alive...showing us what it was like to live on that college campus, in a hothouse of a small group of students who not only took classes together, but seemingly lived with each other nearly 24/7. That it was incestuous in more than one way is not surprising.<br />She also does a remarkable job in showing the disturbing nonchalance with which the students treat their first murder victim, and their second, and only seem to fall apart when their own lives are threatened.<br />I can't decide to what extent this reflects the trend of the times in which she wrote the book (I believe the book reflects her dedication to Brent Easten Ellis, and for some reason, I kept hearing Simple Minds singing &quot;Don't you forget about me&quot; in my head as I read. Hopefully, as I go back to Dostoevsky, that tune will be replaced.)Whether or not......Ms. Tartt did an excellent job in creating characters that were interesting enough to sustain our interest. My only complaint would be that her narrator, a young man, didn't always sound authentically masculine.<br />I am looking forward to reading her next novel.	2001-09-29

I suspect both are true.<br />I recommend this book to history buffs and people like myself, Russian literature enthusiasts who want to put their favorite novels in an historical context.

Pleasant company....are you searching for the door yet?<br />For the first hour, he's going to rant about his philosophy of revenge, the pointlessness of his life, his superiority, his failure, oh yeah, and his tooth. FOr the second half of the book, he's going to tell you a tale, with the title \\"Apropos of the Wet Snow\\". Because of course, there's wet snow outside on the ground.<br />I will leave you with this encouragement. If you can get through this book, you will appreciate Doestoevsky more, understand Crime and Punishment better, and probably enjoy a good laugh more than once.<br />Notes from the Underground is not light reading, but it is well worth the effort.

By the time I'd finished the first chapter, I couldn't stop until I turned the last page.<br />Farrell has created a taut plot, a unique villain, rich background and setting details (I loved the juxtaposition of the urban Boston street scenes with Colonial-time incidents)....all of which make the ride more real.

What an interesting idea....for the teacher and student. The consistency of teaching from one year to the next, ties in perfectly with the developmental model of the Waldorf curriculum. And with the right teacher, the students much derive a great deal of support and nurturance.<br />I picked up this book because I was interested in learning about the Waldorf system. This book accomplished that goal. Now, I'd love to read a book by an adult/student who has gone through the Waldorf system, on to college, and their perspective.<br />Parents who are contemplating or have enrolled their students in a Waldorf school will benefit from this book, and be reassured by the teacher's dedication. Other teachers will gather new ideas for presenting material and be inspired by this teacher's love of his work and his students. A win-win situation.	2001-08-11

I loved Bly's 'take no prisoners' style of dealing with writing teachers, and writing programs, their strengths and their shortcomings. Her insights about how some aspiring writers can be harmed or have their work stymied in its fragile state by workshops and comments by well-meaning students or teachers, is reassuring. However, I wish she had gone further, for instance, in her chapter addressing the process of first, second, etc. drafts of a manuscript. Her comments about the need to protect the work, and to give it time to develop through multiple drafts is valuable, but I believe it could have been fleshed out further.	2001-06-12

I can't remember another author who so richly develops the voice and personality of his characters...I'm just thrilled that this is a series, so I can enjoy more the brilliant dialogue and plot.

I now understand why Cheever is considered one of the best American writers of the short story. He is able to put more character development and observation into a ten page story than many authors accomplish in two hundred pages. Truly a master of observations of a certain strata of suburban existence.	2001-04-23

Unfortunately, understanding that this is a 'true confession' leaves me with little sympathy for the author. She was 20 when the affair started, however, I wonder if she had the moral consciousness of a 3-year old, or if she was as much a sociopath as her father? From her telling, it seems the incest was motivated by a rage toward the mother, both by the husband and the daughter. All three individual's are so completely self-absorbed as to act with only pointed hurt toward one another, while trying to justify their sadism by proclaiming their own victimhood. I wonder what would motivate a person to reveal something that portrays herself in such a horrific way, is it a desire to shame herself in public........or sell books?	2001-04-18

This voice is what makes her story so identifiable.

Both books deal with the process of going from beginning writing, to publishing. Berg speaks from her own experience. Bolker uses an anthology approach, gathering articles from several sources, and grouping them according to theme. Which is effective. However, if you've read any books on writing, some of the articles you'll find here will be too familiar, e.g. Natalie Goldberg's article. On the other hand, the B.F. Skinner article looks very promising. I was hoping for a book with greater insight, rather than a forum of what I've already read.	2001-04-06

The daily journal entries written by Steinbeck show the ebb and flow of his moods, his confidence that he was indeed writing a great book, and those days when he felt that he lacked the talent to pull it off.

It will not be the last, I've already bought the Pevear/Volkhonsky translation of the Brothers K. I'd read Tolstoy before this and there is really no comparison. Both are great authors, but the experience with each is completely different, even though both authors deal with spiritual themes. In Crime and Punishment you get inside the mind of a man who willfully commits murder and then undergoes a spiritual transformation afterward. It's much less subtle than Tolstoy, more raw, but also extremely intriguing.	2001-03-23

I came to &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; expecting the same satisfaction. But I was wrong. &quot;The Sun&quot; is even better! Hemingway captures the voice of his characters through dialogue brilliantly. His sensitive portrayal of Jake Barnes, I'm thinking of the fishing scene, which conveys his loneliness, of the way he takes his friends to Pamplona to try to share his passion for bullfighting, his thwarted love for Brett. I would highly recommend this book for new-comers to Hemingway or those well read in the Papa-genre.	2001-03-23

I've read Paradise and The Bluest Eye...but I've fallen in love with Beloved. Usually, I read through a book quickly...more quickly if the author hasn't captured my imagination. With Beloved, I find myself slowing down, reading a chapter at a time, savoring the beautiful language and the intricate way Ms. Morrison uses language to show us the lives and desires of each character. More than being a chronical of slavery and its aftermath, Beloved gives us the heart and mind of those who experienced it and what they did to survive. This is truly an amazing book.	2001-03-02

And I loved her short story, &quot;Family&quot;. So, I was thrilled when Oprah chose Oates as this month's pick.<br />The character development in this novel is well done. However, one of the first things a writer learns is: &quot;show don't tell&quot;. I believe this novel suffers from too much narration...either the book could have been cut by 100 pages, or some of the narration could have been turned into scenes that would bring us into the story rather than keeping us at a distance, especially as the family falls apart.<br />I think I'll go back to Oates short stories...	2001-02-26

It is, instead, an honest look at the insidious side of alcoholism....how easily it creeps into one's life. How easily we work to disguise it once it's in residence.

It was a good choice, short, sweet, strange.....but enough to wet the appetite for more. Mr. Delillo's use of language in this book is amazing. His sentences are spare, the dialogue echoes, conveying the backward/forward slipping of time like the seashore they walk upon. In all, the story caputures the search of someone who has lost a loved one in death, the walk through familiar rooms hoping to find a remenent, an echo of the loved one's voice.	2001-02-05

I hope that this book will become part of reading lists in high school and college curriculum...I believe it is that important. Other reviews here will tell you what the story is about....I'd like to simply convey how I believe this book will touch the heart of anyone who reads it.	2000-12-30

If the entire book had been told from his point of view, I might not have skimmed through to the end. I lost interest as soon as the author took us into the voice/mind of Kathy and her relationship with Lester. I don't enjoy 'victim-fiction' which is why I haven't read many of Oprah's latest picks. Kathy seemed to fall into that stereotype and Lester's fall into her stretched my imagination too far. I hope Mr. Dubus will write another novel using the strength of the voices he captured in the Behrani family...I'd look forward to reading it.	2000-12-19

The most important lesson from this book is its dispelling the myth of what 'rich' looks like, and how the rich live. I loved the fact that the authors proved through numerous examples the simple mistakes we each make in allocating our resources, to spend rather than save, and the long-term impact those seemingly small and random decisions make in determining our wealth in the long run. No this book won't make you rich. In fact, its greatest truth is that there is no magic path....however, there are a number of things we can do each day, by living more consciously, that will greatly improve our financial security.	2000-11-22

However, the book accomplishes its goal in that it makes the reader consider a house that is designed for the family that lives within its walls, rather than a generic floor plan designed by a mega-developer. It has helped me to consider designing a house that is smaller (and thus more budget conscious) yet reflects the purpose for which I will use the rooms. It also provides ideas on putting construction money into items that will enhance the interior, the comfort of the home, saved through reducing the overall size of the house.	2000-11-22

When you read this book you are presented with all of this information, but in a way that is so integral to the story that it becomes part of fine experience of reading the book. I LOVED this book!

As a Christian woman, and a spiritual woman, I read Ms. Monk's book with hope for insight into another woman's journey. I was disappointed that her journey to wholeness required her to leave Christianity, to give God another gender, to abandon her husband as he tried to understand her struggle.

Through the use of different points of view, she captures the different motivations of each character and offers us a platform from which to understand their actions.

I believe she handles the different voices of her characters very well, skillfully showing us the different impact the experience of the Congo had on each, and how it shaped their lives. Like others, I enjoyed the book until Ms. Kingsolver switched from story to political diatribe. I believe she conveyed the political situation well through the characters earlier and that her final chapters were simply preaching as if we, like Nathan's congregation, just didn't get it.....so she decided to pound it into our heads, much like Nathan's final &quot;baptizism&quot; of the children.

E.Lynn Harris has created a cast of characters that you care  about and relate to no matter what your sexual preference or race. I love  the fact that he has written a series of books that will continue to follow  the lives of these characters, because he makes you care enough about them  to want to follow their stories.

Family Honor, the book introducing Sunny Randall, was the first Parker novel I've read. I enjoyed it so much that I decided to pick up one of his famous Spenser novels so I chose Hugger Mugger. Since this is the first  Spenser novel I've read I can't compare it to the others in the  series...but I can comment on the character. I really like Spenser. I like  his self-depricating sense of humor, I like the way he relates to other  characters, I like his fairness. Quite often I found myself looking at the  photo of Parker on the backcover and imagined that this is what Spenser  looked like to me. Maybe that's what Parker hopes for. Unlike most books I  read which are rich on description and narration, this book is made up  almost entirely of dialogue. This makes for a quick read, it also gives us  the sense of being with Spenser at all times, not so much in his mind as  like a side-kick. I will definetly read more Parker novels...although I'm  really hoping he brings back Sunny Randall on his next outing.	2000-07-15

I have been working my way through this book following the excercises at the end of each chapter. What I've found is that the inspirational stories are &quot;aha&quot; moments that make you realize that there are others who  have the same concerns or dreams and have found the means to act  constructively to make things happen. Ms. Klauser then creates excercises  that mirror the stories so that you can try out the different techniques  for yourself. By using this technique there is no sense that she is  preaching or trying to convert anyone to her own personal agenda. In fact,  I believe you'll find that one excercise works while another doesn't...but  at least you are getting the opportunity to try different ones. In the  genre of self-improvement, this book is a great addition.	2000-07-15

Yet, he is not pushy with his  theology...if anything I was touched by his welcoming of so many peoples,  as he reminds us of Christ's command, &quot;Love God and love your  neighbor.&quot; I can't wait to read more of his books.	2000-07-03

I love this book! When I read it I feel as if I am there with Hemingway  experiencing his sardonic sense of humor, his friendships, his striking  ability to hold a grudge and get back at friends in print, and to  understand a bit more about the mind that created such beautiful work.	2000-07-03

We are presented with only Lewis' side of the conversation, but his references to his friend's response or counterpoints is clear. I loved this book because  it encourages us to pray, not to provide God with a grocery list of our  problems or desires, but to draw into communion with God...and through that  'conversation' we learn about God and ourselves. Like other of Lewis' books  (Mere Christianity)this book is short in length but long in wisdom. Also  like Mere Christianity, you'll want to keep it in your library and read it  again.	2000-07-03

Julia's relaxed, supportive words about the process of writing and our feelings about what we write are not only encouraging they will change the way you  approach your own writing. THe excercises at the end of each short chapter  will also help you to put each lesson into practice. I highly recommend  this book for writers and those who want to write.	2000-07-03

However, it's merit is that it is presents us with a 'bird's eye-view' of Hemingway's later years, the alcholism, his  relationship with his wife Mary, his son, and some of his old friends. It  also gives us a glimpse of his feelings about his writing in his own words.  For those who have enjoyed Hemingway's fiction and read biographies of his  life, this book is a must.	2000-07-03

I am very disturbed about the subject of this book and its review in the New York Times Book Review. It is a work of fiction. Clearly it describes both the external manipulation of children by adults and their  vulnerability to exploitation by those adults and children of their own  age. My question is this: Did the author need to make this point by using  such a destructive context? Or was the context self-serving for the  author...to produce such sensationalized work that it would be noted for  its content rather than its merit as a novel. I am disturbed by what this  novel says about our moral culture and the popularity of abuse/dis-function  novels. I believe we are better than this. And if we are not, we have great  cause to worry about our future.	2000-07-02

This is one of the few books that has made me put aside other reading just to continue the story to the end. The plot draws you into the story, but the characters make you care about them and their  plight. This is perhaps only the second Stephen King novel I've read...now  I look forward to reading more.	2000-06-01

As Oprah asked, &quot;When is cheating, cheating?&quot; Sue Miller handled that issue in a compelling way...in fact, I believe she left it up to the reader to decide. My only  fault is that the plot wasn't riveting. Even the &quot;shocker&quot; at the  end seemed anti-climatic and contrived to cleanse Jo of her actions rather  than truly deal with the crisis.	2000-06-01

I've thought about this book often in the past year and look forward to reading the next book by Ms. Haynes.  Other reviews here will provide a much better synopsis than I could,  however, what I enjoyed the most about this novel were the characters. Ms.  Haynes has created a cast of well-drawn, diverse, and eclectic people,  interesting enough that you care about them long after the novel has ended.  I highly recommend this book.	2000-05-28

Ms. L'Engle graciously brings us into her daily life, her family, and her thoughts on being a writer, wife, daughter, and mother...and her  relationship with God. Each of the four Journals has a different centering  theme, and could stand alone, but I highly recommend that you read all  four.	2000-05-28

He quickly sets up his protagonist's choice and then moves to the surprising consequences. If you had the means to buy your 'salvation' would you? Even if it meant that  another man would have to die in your place...literally paying someone to  die for you? And for the man who is willing to take your offer, what does  his sacrifice mean for those he's left behind? Greene deftly entertwines  both of these stories into one. I agree that the characters are not  well-drawn enough to make us truly care for them. However, the book  succeeds on how it makes you consider the consequences of one's choices.	2000-05-28

On that proverbial island where we might be stuck someday with only a handful of books to sustain us....Mere Christianity would be in my bookbag. Although I have been a Christian since childhood books by Lewis and  Madelaine L'Engle have deepened my personal walk with God immeasurably.  Mere Christianity is a classic discourse on why we are Christians, written  in a thoughtful and timeless language.	2000-05-28

And yet the book seems perfectly suited to this type of reading as it  follows the lives of so many. Tolstoy is a master of character development,  you come to care about even the minor characters.

This is the first book I've read by Dillard, now I'm purchasing her others...I enjoy the way she presents ideas and her original  thinking.

And not because of the violence....simply because it, like Glamorama, was silly, insipid, and boring. I tossed aside Glamorama half way through, unable to find a reason to keep reading. This time, I picked up Amr Psycho  because of the movie coming out...but one quarter of the way through, I've  started skimming. I read Less than Zero years ago and enjoyed it, it  captured the times well. Sadly, it seems that the author hasn't matured as  a person or as a writer since that debut.	2000-04-15

They make very pleasant companions!And I will certainly take her newest one with me on my next trip. HOWEVER....I don't understand Goldie's son Arch. First he seems very immature for a boy of fourteen. Second, I was absolutely amazed  by Arch's betrayal of his mother, is Arch morally vacuus, or simpleminded?  Surely at his age and having lived with his mother, he is aware of the  abuse and ill-will that the JRK carrys. I also could care less for the JRK.  As a character I think he adds nothing, except to make me wonder why Goldie  can't get him out of her life. On a positive note......please give us more  MARLA! She's my favorite character, fun, smart, and sassy!	2000-03-15

Buy a copy of this book for yourself and copies for friends and families. I've just finished reading the essay entitled &quot;When Wisdom Spoke and We Saw Her Beauty&quot;. It's a beautifully written reminder that surface  appearances usually belie the treasures underneath, in ourselves, others,  and in our relationship with God. Carol Dechant's twining of the everyday  with the divine reminds me of the genius of Madeleine L'Engle.	1999-09-24

Once I did, I was disappointed. I loved two of Oprah's previous picks &quot;Paradise&quot; by Tony Morrison, and &quot;As I Lay Dying&quot; by  Ernest Gaines. I am currently reading &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;  another example of beautiful writing. I applaud Oprah's support of first  time novelists, however, I wish she would find a new genre to mine.....we  have read so much of the abused woman/child narrator that whatever real  truth they may be trying to convey is lost because we've read the same  plight repeatedly over the last 12 months. I had little sympathy for  Astrid, she seemed as manipulative as her mother....not victim, not  triumphant, simply surviving the system.	1999-06-29
