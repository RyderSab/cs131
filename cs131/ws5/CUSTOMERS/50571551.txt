Anna accepts his invitation and attends the wedding where she meets Cammie, Sam, and Dee- The A-List.  Cammie, Sam, and Dee are not overly happy with a new girl showing up to  the wedding with the guy they all secretly have crushes on themselves.  Anna's first few days in her new hometown are quite an adventure.  This book ends with Anna attending her first day at the same school as the rest of the girls, setting up what is sure to be an entertaining school year to come.<br />What makes this book different from other series featuring young girls in California is that this one has some class.  There are various references to classical music, poets, and theater which is refreshingly different.  Anna, is very smart, well educated, and has good morals.  Also, all the characters have at least some likable qualities.  Cammie, who is easily the most difficult to like character even has a secret tender side that the reader is let in on.  If the rest of the series keeps up these qualities then it should be an entertaining but intelligent read.	2004-07-14
US	50571551	R3EH6O7FLKZPNM	0142301485	658705307	Many Stones	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Quick but not Light Read	Many Stones by Carolyn Coman is a story about a teenage girl, Berry, who travels to South Africa with her estranged father to attend a memorial for her brutally slain sister.  Just describing the plot makes for a long sentence yet somehow the book comes in at a slim 158 pages.  This is my main criticism of the novel.  It's hard to get into such a deep story about family tragedy so quickly.  The reader kind of jumps right into the troubled lives of Berry and her family with little back story until a few chapters in. <br />Short as it may be, the book stll has several touching moments and may very well be a welcome change for someone looking for a quick read but is tired of the fluff that usually entails.	2003-12-12

Her birth mother is a heroin addict and her foster parents neglect her.  Early on her only comfort comes from listening to tapes of \\"the ladies,\\" such singers as Etta James and Billie Holiday.  She soon discovers she has a gift for singing as well.  From then on all that makes sense to Leshaya is singing.  She does whatever it takes to realize her dream.  <br />Unfortunately, all the years of neglect and abuse have an effect on Leshaya as she bounces around from person to person, ruining every relationship she has.<br />This book is a definite page turner, I'll give it that.  However, just like all the characters in the book that Leshaya encounters, I found her very hard to like.  Even knowing of her rough life it is hard to see past her selfish and cruel ways.  <br />The book ends the best way possible, in my opinion.  Leshaya faced with a very difficult situation finally makes a good, correct decision.	2003-12-12

I was a little nervous when I realized the author's previous endeavors were in screenwriting, and to be honest there were a couple of TV/movie gags... a dream sequence and a round up of how all the character's lives turn out at the end.  But really those things were fine because the whole book felt like a TV show you would not want your mom to catch you watching.   But that only adds to the fun!<br />Sissy Leblanc is a southern housewife in the mid 50's who is looking for a little adventure.  Luckily for her, her old highschool sweetheart just came back to town after 14 years.  The story twists and turns as we discover the secrets in just about everyone's lives in Sissy's hometown of Gentry, Louisiana.  More importantly though Sissy's past is unraveled and we learn just why it is she ended up married to a man she doesn't even really like.  <br />Do not be fooled- that is not just a cute title.!  The book is most definitely scandalous and may not be for those who blush easily.  But as a quick, summer read for a girl looking to read about a romantic adventure but not ready to step into one of her own... this does the job well.	2003-08-19

What I read actually took me quite by surprise.  The life of a stripper is anything but a piece of cake and like Lily many of the women are smart and ambitious rather than helpless victims.<br />I was completely taken by surprise by some of the things I learned in this book like the fact that Burana was a stripper at one time in her life effects so many of her relationships with people near to her.  But luckily for her she does find her Mr. Right who does not care about her stripping past or her soon-to-be stripping present.  <br />See, faced with her impending wedding, she decides to dust off her stiletto heels and go back to the occupation she had given up years earlier.  Her reasoning is to find some saving grace in a rough period of her life.  Throughout her journey she lays it all out on the table for us, the reader.  We learn insider tricks and taboos.  For instance, many strippers have to pay the club a fee to dance on their stage and it is never a good thing when a stripper calls you, Honey.<br />During the cross-country adventure there are many ups and downs.  Times when she feels compelled to continue stripping forever and others when she thinks she can no longer go on.  Ultimately, though, she comes to terms with herself and where her life has lead her.<br />This book is much more than a sexual romp and I think many who may be put off by the theme would find themselves not only enjoying this book but even becoming sympathetic.	2002-07-17

While authors Ian Halperin and Max Wallace never go as far as to point any fingers themselves, they do lay out plenty of claims from other people and sources.  Some are more well-known in the Kurt murder circles like Tom Grant, the private investigator hired by Courtney Love to track her husband in the days leading up to his death.  Courtney's own father, Hank Harrison, gives his two cents as well as numerous others.<br />Like I said, Halperin and Wallace never make any claims themselves but they are great insinuators.  The whole book reads like, \\"Why Courtney Love is evil,\\" but it is a claim they have facts and accounts to back up.  Everything is backed up.<br />Skeptics and old conspiracy theorists alike should find and extremely eye-opening facts regarding the mysterious death of a rock icon.  Bottomline, if you read this book you will at least agree that the case should be reopened.	2002-02-15

These meetings teach Echo more and more about herself until she finally learns just who it is, she is.<br />The novel is told in different phases alternating between Echo herself and people she has encountered in her life.  This proves quite compelling as Echo's opinions of herself typically differ drastically from how others see her.<br />Block continually proves herself as an unique voice and deserves much credit for always writing such beautiful tales.	2002-02-15

During the course of the novel she deals with the same problems and insecurities all young girls face... family problems, best friend issues, boy trouble.<br />The main reason this book stands out from others similar, is its unique format.  The entire story is told through notes, letters, and memos from fictitious organizations.  Which, again, is something I am sure all girls do.<br />I found this novel in the regular fiction section, possibly because of its length, but I would recommend it to the teenager crowd as well.  Perhaps a good novel for both mother and daughter to enjoy.	2002-01-25

No one will be fooled by her changing the name of the lead character's, America, father into Boris Throne and changing his occupation from legendary composer to legendary artist.  She is most definitely speaking of her own father, Frank Zappa.  <br />But the emotion and feelings expressed by America and her crazy way of over reacting to things is enough for her to win you over.  Regardless if she is truly fictitious or not.  Her life, while quite different from most, I would imagine, mirrors our own in a way we can actually relate with.  Sure, your relationship issues probably do not stem from the fact that your father would bring many naked people over for the sake of his art but you probably have issues none the less.  Who has not been so blinded with love that you did not see the break-up coming, or fallen in love with the perfect, unattainable person?<br />Reading this book is much like having a close gal pal sharing about her mixed-up love life.	2002-01-14

She's sex, show, and ego.  She admittedly claims, \\"It wasn't the wrestling that got to me.  It was the show, the spectacle.\\"  I always wonder why people who like the actual wrestling to take a backseat to the other stuff, get involved in the business in the first place.  Shouldn't they maybe join the circus?  But who wants to have a heated affair with a clown?<br />Just like what Missy brought to the world of professional wrestling, she brings to her book.  The sex starts early- in the first chapter at the very first wrestling show she attends and it only picks up from there!  There's flings with several well-known wrestlers such as Jake Roberts and lesser known actors like Jason Hervey of The Wonder Years fame.<br />You have to give her credit though, despite how she got there she was involved in many different federations.  But she never tells you more than who there was good in the sack.  <br />She makes it clear that she slept her way into her position as \\"First Lady of Wrestling.\\"  I have to assume that that is how she also got this book published.  Someone must have agreed to put it out and never even bothered to read it over because there are more grammatical errors than a first grader's novel.<br />Now, obviously, I'm not much of a Missy Hyatt fan although I never saw her work until after I read the book, so she had a fair chance with me.  But if you are a Missy fan, you're sure to like this book.  The one \\"good\\" thing I can say about it is that it IS Missy Hyatt.	2002-01-10

I think most people having read the book would agree with me.  He's charming, witty, and incredibly funny.  <br />For a seriously dark, disturbing book, I sure laughed my head off!  I think the humor is something many people overlook.<br />I don't know exactly who I would go about recommending this book to.  But if you have seen the movie which does an incredible job of bring Mr. Bateman to life, the book is even better.  More grizzly murders and comedic situations.  A great combination?	2001-07-27

The two main characters Amelia and Anny Beth are already 100 and 103 in the year 2001 when some doctors come to them and ask if they would like to be younger.  Well, of course the answer is yes.  This leads them to a scientific experiment that actually reverses the aging process.<br />Trouble is the reversing never stops.  So when we join the 2 again in 2085, they have undergone the difficult task of finding a \\"parent\\" to take care of them when they become too young to do so themselves.<br />My main problem with the book, however, is that it does not really come to a concussion, it just ends.  And I think there were also some continuity errors about what Amelia and Anny Beth could remember and when.<br />Overall, it is still well worth the read and a high rating just on the concept alone.	2001-07-27

Wurtzel messed up!  It was borderline too difficult for me to read at times because like I said, I feel pretty good these days and reading about Wurtzel's experiences brought back a lot of bad times.  <br />But all this is on me.  The truth is she describes the illness about as perfectly as possible.  I have no doubt that if I had found my way to this book during my really dark period it would have been something holy to me.  Whenever trying to explain my feelings I'd just hand people a copy of the book and say,\\"Here!  Read this.\\"<br />Unfortunately I didn't find it then.	2001-06-12

The main character, Barbie, is constantly surrounded by fairies, giants, a \\"cyclops\\", and other monsters.  <br />The book first joins Barbie at age 11.  She is a lonely girl who is wrapped up in her own idea of beauty.  Things like flowers in gardens and her pinky-sized fairy friend, Mab.  But her mother has big plans for her, specifically to be the famous model she never got to be.  And her mother's dreams will come true no matter the cost.<br />Not long her doings become destructive and we fast forward 5 years.  Barbie is now 16 and a party goer.  Luckily she always had her special companion, Mab.  The two often argue but despite that their relationship is a magical one.<br />The ending is a happy one but too soon.

Sara's dream to be on television turns into more of a nightmare after she begins taking diet pills.  Harry, Marion, &amp; Tyrone's dream is pretty simple- to score some uncut heroin in order to resale it and live off the money.  Their plans too go awry when winter comes and their aren't enough drugs to go around.  <br />Some people may not want to read such a devastatingly dark novel but the beauty of it is how real it is.  Selby makes you care for characters you shouldn't who put themselves in bad situations that you can see coming, if only they could.  Honestly, I can't praise this book enough.	2001-04-05

But I doubt I could have picked one more worth the trouble!  As a huge Francesca Lia Block fan for years now, I've always heard of these 2 impossible to find books, Ecstasia &amp; Primavera.  Finally I located them this past December.   <br />Block has always crafted her words into beautiful modern day fairy tales of love and music but never has it created such a enchanting result as with this novel.  I think part of the reason is because she completely creates a new world... one of carnivals, music, love, and youth.  But there is also a scary flip side to this world.  One that the 4 lead characters are struggling to accept.<br />If you are a Block fan and have yet to read these 2 novels you should really, look into them.  I think they are essential reading of the authors.	2001-03-12

I personally have always questioned that her books were really ever exactly young adult in the first place.  But none the less this book is decidedly more adult at least in it's language.  <br />Block uses more blunt descriptions which is the only major change that I noticed.  And to be honest at first it threw me off.  Here are her wonderful tales of love and magic as she's always written but in the middle of these poetic words it's like it breaks for cheap erotica.  This would be my only complaint and by probably the second story I was able to somewhat adjust and lose myself once again in her fairy-tales. <br />Picking a favorite of the stories would be difficult because they all really compliment each other.  Sometimes it's a character from a previous story returning or even a setting but they all weave together to form a very fine collection of stories.	2001-02-10

We quickly join the boys in their quest, eager to discover more about the Lisbons and the tragedy that is their lives.  As if we too are part of the community witnessing first hand their demise.<br />Not as depressing as the title would suggest, though certainly not a happy-go-lucky tale by any means.

When in need of some extra money she dabbled in the night life profession herself as a hostess at a bar where she poured drinks and entertained men.  She is also fluent in the Japanese language.  It?s because of these things that I think she was able to write such a compelling book.  Since she has been a part of both cultures she is able to explain things to an American audience in a way that we can relate to.  <br />I also really like the layout of the book.  She starts out with her story and what compelled her to make the book. But without assuming she is all-knowing on the subject matter.  She recruited numerous others to tell their stories as well.<br />I got the book because of my interest in Geisha but learned so much more than I ever expected to.

I was a little reluctant to read the book for the very reason that I was such a big fan of the film.  Everyone knows how different books and movies are.  I figured it couldn't be anywhere near as good as the movie so I was a little hesitant.  But I did read it since it was a gift and I'm incredibly glad I did.<br />Never in my experiences have a book and the movie it was based on gone hand in hand so well.  For the most part there are no huge differences, rather things just got rearranged.  I considered what was left out from the book to be like bonus time with the characters that I wouldn't have gotten otherwise.  <br />And as a bit of a side note... Everywhere I read this book I had young guys in their late teens and early 20's coming up and telling me how much they loved the book, not just the movie.  To be honest I was surprised that any of them had read the book.  And as much as I loved both the book and the movie I wonder if maybe it did appeal to males more.  Maybe it was just more identifiable with them?  So while I'd suggest to anyone to read it, I would particularly to young men.	2000-12-20

It has all the right attributes for my liking... the main character is a troubled girl (my favorite), and it was written by a young person such as myself (like to help them out.)  But none of this could save the story.<br />The book starts out decent enough but it soon becomes apparent that the 14 year old main character is incredibly unlikable.  Unlike other troubled characters I liked reading about, she seems to strive for it, never once learning from her mistakes.  Everyone else in the book is just about as bad.  She has a miserable family, abusive boyfriends, and an annoying best friend.  <br />The author, Rebecca Ray, uses a lot of description on things that aren't necessary or interesting.  That's what fills up most of the 404 pages.  Then at the end it would seem, Ray, just tired of writing.  No loose ends are tied up and there are plenty, in fact she really opens a whole new can of worms in just the last chapter.<br />Do yourself a favor and skip this one.  I could have finished 3 books in the time it took me to drudge through this one.	2000-11-21
US	50571551	R1RGOOSX6DPNC8	0446676829	343731133	Little Girls in Pretty Boxes: The Making and Breaking of Elite Gymnasts and Figure Skaters	Books	3	3	6	N	N	Entertaining if not taken seriously	I give the book on a whole 3 stars because it did manage to keep me quite entertained.  I liked reading all the antidotes of former gymnasts but what I didn't like was the author's own opinions.  It is quite a frustrating read if you aren't able to just laugh it off.  She apparently was/is a sports writer for a newspaper.  Journalism and book writing are not the same and I think it shows she had a hard time adapting.  For example, she makes way too many references to the title as if to say, \\"it really is an accurate metaphor, really!\\"  Also, she seems way to stuck on gymnastics and figure skating being way worse for the girls involved than anything their male counterparts do.  Early in the book she points to the way the girls starve themselves to remain lean.  She claims the boys never do that.  I'd like to suggest to Ms. Ryan that she take a look into the sports of boxing and wrestling where it's better to be the top of a small division than the bottom of a big one.  And how about horse jockeys?  The less wait on the horses' back, the faster they'll run.  <br />I've read both releases of this book and for the new updated section I'd give it considerably less stars.  There's hardly anything to the one chapter.  Obviously it's just an attempt to cash in on the 2000 Olympics.  There is a lot of talk about how the sport of gymnastics has changed since the original release.  And of course it was greatly do to this book!  Maybe it was, but quit telling us!  Then she says something so uncharacteristic of the famous Kerri Strug vaults at the Atlanta games that I believe Bela got a hold of her and made her say it!  I don't recall any new material on ice skating at all... maybe that will be out in 2002.<br />I'm sorry I bought the new version.  If you have read the original, don't buy this one- borrow it or check it out from the library.	2000-10-20

I don't like how the movie took such creative liberty with the story and it's characters but I also don't like the way the book jumps around so often.  Though some might say the chaotic way the memories are written reflect the author and main character's own unconventional thinking.<br />The book shows us how people with \\"mental problems\\" were all lumped together and for the most part not treated but locked up and subdued.  Were these people totally emotionally fit?  Well, no, but being locked away was not everyone's answer.  <br />I'd like to see a book of the same subject matter about the 1990's and how treatment almost seems the opposite.  Doctors seem happier to keep upping the Prozac dosage rather than lock them up for awhile.  It is interesting to see how people's conceptions can change.	2000-10-20

She is the new girl in school who's a bit different than everyone else.  She carries her pet rat to school, brings her ukelele, and wears period clothing her mom sews.  But more importantly she is possibly the kindest person ever written about.  She celebrates holidays by giving everyone in her homeroom a treat, and leaves greeting cards for people, and sings Happy Birthday to them.  At first her popularity soars and she even becomes a cheerleader.  Unfortunately the very thing that made her popular turns all the students on her... herself.  <br />One boy, the narrator is more caught up with her than anyone else.  He befriends her and the two even date.  But soon he can't stand the peer pressure and asks Stargirl to change.  I have to admit that was really hard to read because I like the narrator but Stargirl shouldn't have to change!   If it weren't for endless positivity some of the book would be too tough to get through.<br />I really love the ending.  I think it ended exactly the way it should.  Not the best for everyone but the best for Stargirl.  Perhaps everyone in the story learns their lesson about conforming individuals and I think the reader will too.	2000-10-20

I picked this book up because judging from the cover, it appeared I had a lot in common with this, Stargirl.  The first night I read over half the book because I found her so enchanting.  What was she going to do next?  Would Leo (the narrator) finally fall for her?  And unfortunately when was everyone going to turn on her?  Of course it was bound to happen because people tend to not want to accept those who are different than themselves.  Admittedly some of the parts were hard to take.  How could people be so cruel to someone who \\"wants to cheer for everyone\\" and celebrates others even more than herself?   What gets you through it is her amazing attitude towards it all.  In fact she doesn't even seem to notice.  I finished the rest of the book the very next day.  I adore the ending.  Maybe it's not the way some people would want it to end but I think it was the best and most conceivable way for things to go.  Indeed I did have a lot in common with Stargirl but I was never able to express myself around others the way she does.  I think everyone is like Stargirl on the inside but just a little less in touch with ourselves and the earth.  And that only adds to her specialness.	2000-10-13

I was not disappointed!  This was a very quick read because I found each of the stories quite intriguing.  I was always eager to read the next one.  Some of the stories (Snow, Beast, Glass) are fairly similar to their classic version while others (Charm, Wolf) take on a very new modern twist.  I wasn't familiar with all of the original plots (Bones, Ice) so I assume them to be lesser known stories (i.e. not a Disney movie!)  And these were the ones that turned out to be my favorites.  Fans of Block's should not be let down...	2000-10-08

I decided to read it because I was curious what a geisha really was. I know most Westerners think them to be prostitutes but to me that didn't seem to be the whole of it.  Indeed it's not.  They are very skilled and cultured women who for the most part entertain men with stories, dances, and games.  But that's not to say there isn't a little of the other involved in the job description.  Namely in the ritual known as mizuage, the selling of their virginity.<br />We learn about the life of geishas through a young Japanese girl named Chiyo.  She was born to a poor family who painfully sale her and her older sister in hopes they'll have a better life.  Chiyo is bought by a geisha house in real-life geisha district, Gion.  We witness her struggle from maid to an apprentice and finally an actual geisha named Sayuri.  The only problem that I could have with the book is the ending.  I can understand why she ended up where she did... how else would she feel free to tell her story?  But the build up was so great with wonderful tales and exquisite detail that the end seemed a little abrupt.  On a whole the book is still good enough to make up for it.<br />Read this book because it tells an amazing story filled with splendid characters, remarkable descriptions that make you see the story in your mind, and because you can't help but pick up some of the Japanese culture.	2000-10-05

You don't know what's going  on and a bunch of characters are introduced that you never fully meet.  I  admit I had to keep looking back to see who she was talking about.  <br />I  did however feel sorry for Miranda in that she was born into a truly  dysfunctional life and I soon learned to like her despite the fact she  tried hard to keep you from just that.  <br />After her boyfriend dies, she  downward spirals until one night after a particularly bad OD, her only  'good' friend Brett, talks her mom into getting some help for her.  Of  course her busy mother is really just put off at the hassle but sends her  daughter away anyway.  After all won't things be easier with her gone for  awhile?  In rehab she learns a lot and transforms into the likable person  you'd hope she would. <br />When out she's faced with saying no to all her old  friends and being completely shun by her whole crowd.  It ends with her  really starting to get the idea if what's important to her and you believe  that she'll really be ok.	2000-09-08

But serious ice skating lovers should also get  something out of it.  <br />The book contains a lot of personal experiences  and a lot of young athletes heartache but it fails to ever fully convince  it's reader that things are all bad in the sport.  Mainly due to the lack  of up to date accounts.  Almost all the horror stories are from the late  seventies and eighties.  If things are still so bad, why not mention the  current troubles?  <br />The writing is at times weak.  There is a lot of  references to the title... a lot!  And the stories are sometimes split up  in nonsensical ways.  But overall, if you love the sport and want to know  more dirt than they print in the stars' biographies then it's a great read.	2000-09-01

The story is such a romantic, modern day fairy tale that anyone should be able to fall in love  with these characters.  <br />Block has a way with words like no other author  I've found.  She has a way of painting a picture of the people, their  feelings and places... you can honestly see the story in your head.  <br />I'd  particularly suggest this book to teens that don't like reading because  they can't relate to any of the books out there. The series which is really  more like one novel, is broken into 5 books so it appears less intimidating  to tackle.	2000-09-01

First off I have to say I only found out about this book because of the  movie which I thought was great.  After having read the book, I still think  it was a very well done movie but it leaves out so much of the little  things that make this tale so charming.  <br />I absolutely fell in love with  the book and it's small town Oklahoma residents.   It gives you such hope  that in this age of divorce and broken families, the true sense of family  is still a need everyone has and can fulfill with those other than your  'blood relatives'. <br />Most people have heard how the story starts.  17  year-old Novalee Nation is pregnant and abandoned by her boyfriend at a  Wal-Mart.  From there we follow Novalee as she takes the journey from an  uneducated, homeless teenager to a loving, strong woman.  Along the way she  meets the people who take her in as family and teach her that people are  basically good, and that home is... Where the Heart Is.	2000-09-01

So knowing that it has been the last one for quite some time, I found it a disappointing conclusion to the series.   As it was no conclusion at all. Of course, I have no idea if she plans more  from the Weetzie Bat gang so that is probably unfair.<br />This book is told  from Witch Baby's point of view.  The only other main character to have a  part in this story is Weetzie.  But soon she and the rest of the clan are  left back in Shangra-LA when Baby heads to New York.  <br />She's on a quest  to find her true love, Angel Juan after he leaves to find himself, making  music alone.  While there she meets an important family member who helps  her along the way.  Left with bazaar clues she feels a real urgency to find  Angel, sensing he is in danger.  <br />Block's wonderful descriptions are as  strong here as ever but the setting is darker and more disturbing than the  usual sunny LA.  Maybe it's just me but I slightly preferred the happy  surroundings.	2000-09-01
