The fourth edition still includes most of that material,  but the fourth edition is beginning to include too much chaff with the  wheat, digging up obscure seventeenth and eighteenth century poets and  placing them side by side with Donne, Milton, and Pope.  The obscure  figures are only going to suffer by comparison; there is not going to be  any sudden Eliot-like revaluation of these obscure poets' reputations.   It's even worse in the contemporary period -- dozens of second-rate poets,  sampled with one or two poems apiece, which only takes away from the space  that could have been granted to Wilbur, Ashbery, Geoffrey Hill, Derek  Walcott, etc. -- not to mention Auden, who is still given too few poems to  grasp his entire achievement.  It's too bad the third edition isn't  available any longer.	1999-03-09

However, both introductions  demonstrate the authors' shortcoming in assuming that their respective  Theories (anxiety of influence and mythical criticism) are capable of  encompassing anything and everything in literature.  In other words, they  mistake theory for reality.  Aside from this one qualm, however, &quot;The  Anatomy of Criticism&quot; is well-put-together and well-argued in a  precise rhetorical style.  It is hard to imagine how a reader could argue  with the proposition that the principles of criticism must arise from an  inductive, empirical study of literary texts themselves, rather than  importing as many &quot;-isms&quot; as suits the reader's fancy, in order  to prove the reader's wishes.  Common sense is an excellent guide.	1999-02-12

There is an obvious reference to the story of Gawain and his nemesis in the novel, a reference which is made explicit by a  couple of the characters in the narrative.  The ending, with its multiple  marriages, is a little over the top in terms of contrivance; but, as Ms.  Murdoch said herself in interviews -- in a passage quoted by the news wire  after her death -- her novels have a beginning, middle, and end, which is  more than we can say for most overtly &quot;literary&quot; novels these  days.

In addition to being an impeccable craftsman of formal (metrical and rhymed) poetry, Roethke has  given us some of the best free verse in the language.  The poems on his  father's greenhouse demonstrate Roethke's own critical comment that the  best free verse has the ghost of formal verse behind it.  &quot;The Lost  Son&quot; is equally impressive.  Whether you're interested in formal or  free verse, then, Roethke is an excellent poet.	1999-02-02

These flaws and more are  addressed in this lucidly written book, which contains sections on the  concrete image, sentiment, and intelligence and their places in poetry.   Its only drawback is that its anthology section is too brief.  Prospective  poets would do well to begin here, and to supplement their reading with  Fussell's &quot;Poetic Meter and Poetic Form,&quot; Harvey Gross's  &quot;Sound and Form in Modern Poetry,&quot; and Perkins's &quot;History of  Modern Poetry,&quot; among others.	1998-11-03

On the one  hand, it seemed overwhelmingly &quot;honest&quot; to me when I first read  it.  On the other hand, I've read a great deal of philosophy since then,  and the initial book now seems trivial by comparison.  The book at least  provides stimulus to a reader's thoughts, but then once the reader has  grown, he may disavow the original catalyst.  The book is too serious for  the general reader but too lightweight for a serious student of philosophy.   The narrative of the cross-country motorcycle trip is alternately  compelling and lackluster.  The tone and style of writing is colloquial,  which may or may not agree with the reader.  Overall, then, I give the book  a three-star rating, mainly on account of its quality to stimulate the  general reader (and it is the general reader to whom the book is addressed)  into thinking about metaphysics and modern society.	1998-10-13

After years of reading, I still find his prose more effective and more useful than his poetry.  (I know -- sheer heresy.)  Eliot places great emphasis on The Tradition and on an impersonal approach to art, an emphasis which aspiring writers of today would be wise to heed.

The tone of the book implies that evolutionary psychology may be used to explain anything and everything about human behavior.  This is never directly stated, but the tone is unmistakeable.  I would rather have seen a disclaimer at the beginning of the book saying what evolutionary psychology actually is -- a useful means of analyzing human behavior, but not the ONLY means, and certainly not the only correct means.<br />The book also makes wild leaps in connecting together various pieces of evidence which simply would not hold for a real logician.  William of Ockham stated that we should not multiply uncertainties needlessly.  Aristotelean logic, furthermore, gives us explicit restrictions on how we may use particular propositions in a chain of reasoning.  Wright has violated such rules of basic reasoning in this book, stringing together arguments which are at best tenuous.  And I recall another philosopher, Leslie Stephenson, who, criticizing the work of Konrad Lorenz, asked if it is legitimate to draw inferences on HUMAN behavior from ANIMAL behavior.  (A human being is, after all, a little more complex than a rhesus monkey.)<br />All in all, although I think evolutionary psychology can make some positive contributions to our understanding of humanity, the field, as it is depicted in this book, needs more development and good old fashioned scientific skepticism.	1998-06-16

The book includes chapters on ozone depletion and global warming and potential solutions, both radical and moderate; observations on Monday night football, of all things, and its usefulness as a release of humanity's competitive and aggressive urges; an analysis of the abortion issue; a chapter of historical analyses of the United States and the Soviet Union, published in both countries simultaneously in the late 1980s; and a scientific attempt to define the parameters of morality.  (This latter chapter is the only one with which I have a strong complaint, for an inattentive reader is likely to miss the subtleties of the argument and come away with quite mistaken conclusions on Sagan's intentions.)  Let no one say that science or rationality or skepticism are &quot;threats&quot; to a human way of life after reading a humanistic author such as Sagan.  Overall, an excellent book.	1998-06-03

Line breaks and stanzaic patterns had completely lost touch with meaning and content.  After these poems, the collection improves, at least marginally.  Every now and then a rhymed or off-rhymed piece appears, and many poems use either a loose pentameter or a free verse line of which, as Theodore Roethke would say, one can see the ghost of formal verse lurking behind it.  Pinsky uses assonance and consonance to enrich his lines; concrete imagery and language are plentiful, which will please readers who look for this feature first and foremost; but few lines herein are really memorable.  Still, I would single out poems like &quot;Shirt,&quot; &quot;Icicles,&quot; and &quot;From the Childhood of Jesus&quot; as noteworthy ones.	1998-05-20

It's refreshing to see an analysis of Browning's pentameter style which emphasizes not his &quot;colloquial&quot; approach, as so many others do, but instead lauds the extent to which he moves AWAY from the colloquial style and more toward roughness and jaggedness.  The Modern period is handled with finesse as well.  The drawbacks to the book, in my opinion, begin with the period closer to the present.  Some of the analyses on free verse do not make as much sense as similar analyses in Paul Fussell's &quot;Poetic Meter and Poetic Form,&quot; despite the more recent volume's indebtedness to the former.  As D. H. Lawrence said, it is no use manufacturing fancy laws for the governing of free verse.  Too much weight is given to some poets who are clearly minor, such as Maxine Kumin, and too little to poets whose craftsmanship is unquestioned, such as Robert Lowell.  Most oddly, there is no attention given to two of the finer formal craftsmen of recent history, James Merrill and Derek Walcott; these two use free verse but also expand the boundaries of traditional metrical approaches, and their efforts here should not go unnoticed.  And I might take issue with the expanded coverage given to the most recent trend in prosody, the New Formalists, simply because, as I noted in my review of &quot;Rebel Angels&quot; for Amazon, they aren't that good and they haven't ADVANCED metrical techniques that much.<br />Aside from these qualms, &quot;Sound and Form&quot; is a good survey of prosody of the ! last century.	1998-05-07

(And understand, when I call a book a classic, I am not just lapsing into a cliche; it really IS a classic.)  Fussell shows us the relations between form and content, between rhyme and rhythm on the one hand and the function of these formal devices to illuminate meaning on the other.  The book also devotes a chapter to empirical observations on the properties of free verse, and it includes a concise bibliography of other works on prosody.  Highly recommended.	1998-05-01

In a nutshell, I would say this work is a near miss.  It is steeped in satirical tradition, and nearly every other literary tradition, for that matter.  The clever rhymes remind one of Formalist or Metaphysical wit or of Byron's &quot;Don Juan,&quot; the digressions remind one of &quot;Tristram Shandy,&quot; etc.  However, nearly all of these comparisons are to this most recent work's disadvantage.  It is serious where it should be playful, and playful where it should be serious, and the clever rhymes begin to grate on one's ears after prolonged listening.  The book is competent without being memorable.	1998-04-10

It is also pointed out that Eagleton does not attempt an unbiased approach in this book.  This, also, is true, and is not objectionable, until the last twenty pages or so.  In these latter pages, Eagleton states he is not going to promulgate his own Marxist views on literature; but a careful examination of his end matter will reveal that he is arguing dialectically and materialistically, and dialectical materialism is, after all, Marxist.  Eagleton has thus, to an extent, been intellectually dishonest with his reader.  The only other major flaw is that he spends too little time on feminist literature.  However, in terms of a good, general work on literary theory's essentials, this book is still quite adequate, and is refreshingly free of the English scholar's claustrophobic jargon which mars so much criticism these days.	1998-03-24

He indicts just about everything that is phony in American society -- which is to say, he indicts just about everything in American society, period.  This book is out of print?

Ginsberg is overrated.  This in itself is not catastrophic, but he has also exercised too great an influence on other poets, who have mistaken, as Strunk and White would say, spontaneity for genius.  I have seen &quot;Howl&quot; praised by one reviewer as &quot;the ONLY brilliant American poem in existence,&quot; apparently forgetful that there was once a book called &quot;Leaves of Grass,&quot; among others; which shows that the grounds on which Ginsberg is praised are often too filmsy to offer real support.	1998-03-06

I find Bloom's models of &quot;the anxiety of influence&quot; and of Viconian cultural evolution to be fascinating, but no more than models; they do not encompass the totality of literature.  The biggest flaws in his analysis of individual works are that he is too general, and that he does not cite enough concrete evidence.  This, however, was probably inevitable, as the book was aimed at a general audience. --- Having said these things, however, I believe Bloom's plea for cultural conservatism, for skepticism of today's trends, is right on the mark.  He does not condemn multicultural or feminist or avant garde works; rather, he asks that they be accepted based on their aesthetic merits alone.  Thus, you will find &quot;The Country of the Point Firs&quot; on the list of canonical works, but not the works of Mary Noailles Murfree (a contemporary of Jewett's).  You will find Borges, but not his weaker imitators.  The criterion is aesthetic value -- which, he says, is elitist only in the sense that one's critical standards must be severe.  If a work is a dull, mud-encrusted stone, no amount of polishing is going to make it look like an emerald.	1998-02-17

As such, to say that the scientific method is &quot;biased&quot; is to miss the point.  The scientific method, as Sagan states, is self-correcting; it has no problem with admitting when it is mistaken.  (Sagan even devotes a portion of one chapter to admitting when he was wrong, in big ways, in the past.)  Science cannot lead to that vague (and sometimes laughable) concept, &quot;The Truth,&quot; but then neither can any other school of philosophy, as thinkers from Kant to Derrida have ably demonstrated.  Skepticism and empiricism at least put us on a strong footing.	1998-02-09

Then I went back to school and got my master's in literature and reread Taylor's book and all my old enthusiasm was gone.  This was not Pulitzer material.  On the other hand, given the abominable state of today's poetry, maybe it was.  I've given this book a &quot;3&quot; only because there were a few rhymed pieces in it, which were marginally better than the others, although the subject matter is universally banal throughout.	1998-01-09

Among other famous writers, Joseph Conrad and Vladimir Nabokov both thought so.  Dickens uses two different narrators with two highly distinctive and impressionistic styles to illuminate his plot.  The narrative itself is as tightly constructed as the bricks in an Egyptian pyramid.  The novel accords us a panoramic view of the entirety of Victorian society -- its upper classes, its lower classes, its philanthropists, its charlatans, and its genuine heroes.	1998-01-08
US	52810195	R44C8NRJXMLR	0394480449	921712930	Sula	Books	1	2	6	N	N	not her best work	Toni Morrison has written some fine novels, such as &quot;Beloved,&quot; but this isn't one of them.  &quot;Sula&quot; seems to celebrate negativity.  If Matthew Arnold were alive today, he would say the book doesn't animate.  Neither does it awaken a feeling of pleasing melancholy.  (This is not to say we should judge the book based on Victorian standards; merely that he used the best words to describe one's reaction to the book.)  The early scene in which the two friends dig a hole is so un-subtle that it destroys any pleasure to be derived from its symbolism.  The ending, as in so much contemporary fiction, simply fades out rather than establishing any coherence.	1998-01-05

T. S. Eliot pointed out, speaking of Milton, that a poet can be great but still exercise a bad influence on those who follow him.  I myself, speaking of &quot;Howl,&quot; would use words very similar to those Tennyson used in describing &quot;Sordello&quot; -- I liked only the first line of it.  There are better free verse poets than Ginsberg, just as there are better critics of America than Ginsberg.	1998-01-05

My only complaint with his work is that I get a strong sense of deja vu when reading it -- sometimes I think I'm reading Richard Wilbur instead.  (Of course, Richard Wilbur is hardly a bad model.)  Steele writes almost entirely in meter and rhyme and is the most competent poet featured in the &quot;Rebel Angels&quot; anthology.	1997-12-16

Meter and rhyme, as Dana Gioia has pointed out, have been in decline for decades.  The New Formalist poets have made a valiant effort at reestablishing meter and rhyme, but unfortunately their own competence in traditional forms is in some question.  There are exceptions:  Timothy Steele, while he sounds too much like Richard Wilbur on occasion, is the best of the lot, with Bruce Bauer, Charles Martin, and Brad Leithauser runners-up.  The rest suffer deficiencies in craftsmanship, sometimes serious ones.  The revival of formalism has much ground to cover.  However, despite these reservations, the book provides a good starting point for those interested in contemporary, formal poetry.  (The committed reader would do well to check out the original volumes by the poets mentioned above, particularly Steele.)	1997-12-16

Jane Smiley deserves credit for her concept, updating &quot;King Lear&quot; for modern times, but the fleshing out of her concept does not aspire highly enough.  There are problems using the stream of consciousness technique and a first person narrator which are not solved in this novel.  For instance, around page 100, the main character predicts that all hell will break loose within her family -- yet there is no connection between THIS thought and what comes before or after in her character's mind.  For a professional novelist, this is a fatal error.  Smiley goes to great lengths to describe every meal which her characters are eating -- hardly necessary to advance the plot, and quite tedious to boot.  The ending lacks the climax of Shakespeare; the story simply peters out in descriptions of that cliche in American fiction, The Decline of the Family Unit.  Much of what is wrong with the novel stems from modern feminist literary critism, which once was DEscriptive, and useful, but which now has become PREscriptive and inhibiting.	1997-12-04

The opening essays of the book are a necessary (and necessarily condemnatory) critique on the current state of poetry in America.  The articles on Kees, Jeffers, etc., are less impressive, and the review reprints which end the book are even less so.  Still, the strength of the first few essays outweighs these drawbacks.	1997-10-01
