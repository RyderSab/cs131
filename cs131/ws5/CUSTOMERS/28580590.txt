She is alive, witty, vivacious, unpredictable, wise, charming, alluring, extremely appealing.  She exudes life and caring wherever she goes.  Every man hopes to meet and to love such a woman someday.   <br /> <br />The book (and movie) are a bit dated in the relations between father and son.  In the sixties \\"everybody\\" hated their parents, so no one was at all bothered by Oliver's treatment of his father.  True, his father is difficult, but not bad or cruel; and anyone who is a college senior should have been able to deal with him better than Oliver does.  Oliver's rage borders on the incredible.   <br /> <br />But this is a mild irritant that does not seriously damage the tremendously effective love story (although you do wonder sometimes what Jenny sees in HIM).   <br /> <br />If you like this type of love story, check out Last Things, First Things, which is of the same type, but involves thirty-somethings rather than twenty-somethings.   <br />	2005-09-21

Books	5	36	53	N	N	thinking about the unthinkable	It is interesting that we in America are arguing about what was taken for granted in Europe five hundred years ago.  Is Islam a threat?  The answer to this question was self-evident to Europeans in the Middle Ages.  But after Granada and the standoff at Vienna, Islam has occupied itself with spreading into the East, not the West.  Until now.   <br /> <br />There is one major difference between the threat of Islam and the threat of Nazi Germany.  The Nazis did not have us over a barrel (pun intended) the way the Saudis do.  (See \\"Prince of Darkness\\".)  If we were to do anything effective to stop Islam, the price of oil would skyrocket and the American economy would be in serious trouble.  Think of Katrina.  Only one American city destroyed, and the Saudis grabbed the opportunity to raise the price of oil by 50% in a matter of weeks.  American businesses have already cheapened their products in every way they can.  Their backs are to the wall.  If they are faced with yet another price increase, how will they cope?  America is powerless before this weapon of mass economic destruction.   <br /> <br />One tidbit of historical information I have not seen discussed is the reported fact that in the 1940s American and British oil companies paid for the oil exploration in Saudi Arabia, Iran, etc., built the refineries, pipe lines, etc., having secured a contract with the ruling authorities in these countries to share the proceeds of the oil in various proportions, 50-50, 60-40, etc.  Once the refineries were operational, the Arabs moved in and simply took them over.   <br /> <br />And yes, if America and Britain moved into Saudi Arabia and took back the refineries, not only the leftwing press but the conservative press as well would howl about free enterprise.   <br /> <br />So, we are stuck.  And the Europeans are even more dependent on Arab oil than we are.  The real question is, just how long will we allow them to bleed us, how weak will we allow ourselves to become beforewe react?   <br />	2005-09-19

Legions of these storm troopers are unleashed by teachers every time a book appears that threatens to give them away.  Usually the \\"reviewers\\" don't even bother to look at the book.   <br /> <br />But the intelligent, considered reviews also miss the point.  This is not just another book on the misuse of psychotherapy.  The authors are aware that there are a number of such books.  The contribution made by this book is to show how \\"therapism\\" has been co-opted by the politically correct educational establishment to help weaken the students psychologically and made them more receptive to the indoctrination which they are unwittingly undergoing.  In exposing these practices, this book supplies urgent information for all parents and for grown students.  Szasz couldn't have dealt with this problem since it didn't exist in 1961. <br /> <br />If you are unaware of the revolution that has taken place in schools and colleges in the last twenty-five years, the best (and least biased) books are Who Stole Feminism? (1993), Illiberal Education (1991), and The Rape of Alma Mater (2004).  Two of these books were written by liberals, one by a conservative.   <br />	2005-09-16

The author does not attempt to conceal this fact, and bringing together information from disparate sources can be useful.   <br /> <br />Second, his personal pets: religion, anti-sex norms, etc. are shouted so loudly and so often that the strong impression is given that everything in the book is merely the personal prejudices of a biased observer.  The book, thus, will appeal only to the already converted.  Moderates are likely to dismiss the other material in the book (taken from other authors) that is not merely personal preference.   <br /> <br />Third, the author perpetuates the confusion over the term \\"liberal\\". Much of the confusion is that the word \\"liberal\\" and the word \\"Left\\" are conflated by many/most people on the left AND on the right. The sad fact is that people in general (left or right) do not know what liberalism is and hence do not know the difference between liberalism and leftism. Some suppose it is a matter of degree. A review is not the place to teach fundamental principles of political philosophy. You'll have to get an authoritative book on the subject to find out. (By \\"authoritative\\" I do not refer to pop political polemics, whatever their merits). To whet your curiosity, I'll only say that liberalism and leftism, although they agree on social justice, hold totally opposite positions on two other fundamental political principles.  <br /> <br />This confusion is exploited by the Left. They call themselves \\"liberals\\"! This leads many liberals to identify \\"liberalism\\" with whatever is being promoted by the Left. This charade also succeeds in duping conservatives into lumping together the Left with liberals (e.g. Ann Coulter). Thus, most liberals are going along with leftist practices and doctrines thinking that they are being true to liberalism. This is the most effective tactic the Left has.  <br /> <br />On the positive side, many of the points in the book deserve thinking about.  Unfortunately, this book with its polarizing language is not likely to produce thinking, rather a hardening of already adopted positions.  To read a more tolerant and fair account, read The Rape of Alma Mater, as well as Christina Hoff Sommers' well-known book, and Kors & Silvergate. And incidentally, the authors of these books are true liberals, not right-wing hardliners.  It would do conservatives well to read these books too, to understand the difference between liberals and leftists.   <br />	2005-09-10

Among the reviews below, you will see considerable disagreement as to who the Left is and what the Left stands for.  Much of the confusion is that the word \\"liberal\\" and the word \\"Left\\" are conflated by many/most people on the left and on the right.

Thus, most liberals are going along with leftist practices thinking that they are being true to liberalism.  This is the most effective tactic the Left has.   <br /> <br />The most serious problem with this book is that it does not answer the question why.  This shows that the author does not know why.  And this leads him to fail to provide a convincing picture of Leftists and their motives, which in turn makes the book unconvincing to liberals, centrists and moderates.  A popular book that provides such an understanding is The Rape of Alma Mater.  However, there is still much data in this book that should receive serious consideration.  (Incidentally, the review by Library Journal tends to confirm Flynn's contention that librarians have bought into the Left mindset.)<br /> <br />It is also amusing to read the hate reviews below, especially when they shriek that they do NOT hate America!@!!!@!*!! <br /> <br />The most serious shortcoming of the book is the fact that the Left is doing far worse things than this book mentions.  To find out what, read the aforementioned Rape of Alma Mater, as well as Christina Hoff Sommers' well-known book, and Kors & Silvergate.

I agree with all that the other reviewers have said and won't repeat it.  There is one question though that cries out to be asked: Why?  Why are such bizarre things being done to our children?  And how did all this come about?  There are a number of books that give a piece of the answer to these questions, such as \\"Who Stole Feminism?\\" which has chapters on \\"Transforming the Academy\\" and \\"Transforming the Curriculum.\\"  To get the whole picture, read [[ASIN:0595435246 While America Sleeps: How Islam, Immigration and Indoctrination Are Destroying America From Within]].  This book explains exactly what and how and why the schools are as they are.  It is not an accident.  Nor is it entirely incompetence.    One way or another, Americans must take back the education of children as well as protect them from the miseducation coming from the mass media.  With books like these, we can do it!    The book is well documented with footnotes and quotes from others, showing that the facts alleged here are not the imagination of the author.      As important, the book contains resources that parents can use.  Turtell points out that homeschooling as usually conceived is not the only alternative to public schools.  There are a variety of Internet schools, some of them fully accredited.  Some offer direct interaction with the teacher.  Some of more structured than others.  A few are religion-affiliated.  Most are secular.      The author points out that in ALL 50 states parents now have the legal right to educate their children at home.  The book provides long lists of various kinds of resources available on the Internet for doing this, including material for preparing for college entrance exams and for applying for admission to college for homeschooled kids.	2005-03-13

To avoid predictable charges of misquoting, the author uses the perpetrator's own words, thus letting them hang themselves.  For example, a pamphlet put out by the American Sociological Association says that \\"it is not open to debate whether a white student is racist..., he simply is.\\" (p.8)  And the law school faculty of SUNY Buffalo adopted a resolution that \\"our intellectual community shares values that go beyond a... commitment to open and unrestrained debate.\\" (p. 9)  As the book goes on to document case after case and quote source after source, it becomes clear that these examples are not mere isolated instances but are typical cases.  <br />The bad news is that things have gotten worse since this book came out in 1991.  Also, this book does not explain how such a counterproductive education system came to be.  Other books provides pieces of the answer, but for a full account up to the present time, get The Rape of Alma Mater.

As the title suggests, the author contends that something has happened to the women's movement since the days of sisterhood.  The movement has been taken in directions so counterproductive that the original leaders of the movement have been forced to openly oppose it.      The book begins with particularly egregious examples of careless scholarship by academics calling themselves \\"feminists.\\"  It documents how these misstatements were picked up by various publications, including popular ones such as \\"Ms.,\\" and circulated as fact, even misleading government agencies and foundations in the process.  These examples all involve questions of extent: the extent of anorexia among women, the extent of \\"domestic battery, rape, sexual harassment, bias against girls in school, wage differentials,\\" etc. (p.15)  In addition, these self-appointed advocates are intent upon blaming America itself.  \\"...it is not enough to remind us that many brutal and selfish men harm women.  They must persuade us that the system itself sanctions male brutality.\\" (p.16)  These allegations against  \\"feminists\\" are documented by the words of the \\"feminists\\" themselves and would be comical except for the fact that so many women have now been taught to believe them.  One example: Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is said by one feminist musicologist to be the \\"murderous rage of a rapist incapable of attaining release.\\" (p.28)      In chapters entitled: Transforming the Academy, New Epistemologies, The Feminist Classroom, and A Bureaucracy of One's Own, the book documents the revolution that took place in universities in the 1980s.  (Epistemology, by the way, is the study of how one comes to know something.)  The new \\"feminists\\" have posited that women have special gifts that enable them to know things without the use of such time-consuming and bothersome male-dominated tools as observation, theory-formation, testing, revision of theories, re-testing, etc. (p.74 ff)  As to courses of study, new \\"fields\\" withnew texts have been generated.  Eminent feminists such as Iris Murdoch have been quick to condemn such nonsense: \\" `Women's Studies' can mean that women are led to read mediocre or peripheral books by women rather than the great books by humanity in general....It is a dead end.\\" (p.78).  The \\"feminist\\" classroom, moreover, is centered around avoiding all criticism including self-criticism.  Criticism is \\"backlash\\" in disguise. (p.93)  \\" `Challenging facts', stating the exceptions to every generalization\\", constitutes \\" `classroom harassment.' \\" (p. 93)  The transformation of universities extends to taking over the bureaucracy as well, getting \\"feminists\\" appointed to committees, Presidencies of universities, professional associations, etc. (p.118 ff)  \\"Faculty members who are not `keeping up with current trends' in postmodern and feminist thought may be disqualified from sitting on tenure and promotion committees.\\" (p.129)  Each of these claims is documented by case after case and quote after quote.      The bad news is that things have gotten worse since this book came out in 1994; and though the book suggests that the roots of all this are in the sixties and seventies, the book does not show how.  For a full account of the roots and further deterioration up to the present time, get The Rape of Alma Mater.  Additional documentation of the changes in academia in the eighties can be found in Illiberal Education.  Other books such as The New Thought Police, and \\"Shut Up and Sing\\" show how these changes are now spreading to society at large through the media.	2005-02-11

Creating characters involves: \\"getting the first idea..., creating the first broad strokes, finding the core of the character...finding the paradoxes within the character..., adding emotions, attitudes, and values, adding details to make the character specific and unique\\" (p.23).  These steps are then elaborated in separate chapters (although the elaboration consists mostly of extended examples of films most people--those who actually saw the films--would consider to be mixed bags at best, long series of autobiographical paragraphs, and extended quotes from screenwriters ruminating about their experiences in writing this or that character).  Seldom is information actually added to that already given on page 23.   <br />There are also chapters on backstory--use backstory only when you have to (p.56), minor characters, dialogue--\\"bad dialogue is difficult to speak...all characters sound alike...spells out every thought...simplifies people instead of revealing their complexity\\" (p.151), and nonrealistic characters.  Also a chapter on avoiding stereotypes and other character problems such as unlikable characters and vague characters.   <br /> <br />There is only enough actual information in the book to fill an article; but if you are a beginning screenwriter, this book (and many others) can be a help to you.  The thing to be careful of is (a) emulating writing from movies that most viewers were lukewarm about.  You want to learn the best techniques, not the mediocre ones.  And (b) thinking that if you've read this book, you know all you need to know about characterization.  You don't.  Far from it.   <br />	2005-02-06

Beginning writers have to learn the fundamentals somewhere.  An intermediate book would be a bad book for an absolute beginner.  The advantage of this book over other beginning books is that it does not bob and weave over every point for fear of being wrong.   <br />This book is also criticized for its use of the three-act structure.  In fact, however, Field implicitly acknowledges the inadequacy of this structure, although he invents other terms to hide this fact.  \\"Act II is twice the length of Acts I and III; it is a unit of action that is 60 pages long\\" (p. 122).  This makes it 60% of the whole screenplay.  But then, Act II is broken into two parts, called \\"First Half\\" and \\"Second Half\\".  The turning point that leads from one to the other, Field calls \\"the midpoint\\" (p.131).  First Half and Second Half, moreover, are divided by a \\"pinch\\" (p. 155).  So, in fact, Field's structure is not the boring work turned out by so many screenwriters, in which something happens on page 20, something further happens on page 80, and the entire second act marches in place or repeats the same impressions over and over with additional behavior in different places.  In Field's paradigm, some important development occurs every 15 to 20 pages.  These points are illustrated by extended examples from a number of movies.  And in fact, these examples occupy about 80% of the space in this very short book.    <br /> <br />Still, this (six Act?) structure may be too rigid for experienced screenwriters.  Why not have several things happen in a row?  If you've got enough material, you can do it.  The problem with most beginners is, they don't invent a long enough story or a story with enough events or steps in it.  Being presented with a structure like Field's at least forces such writers to come up with something!  But it also gives aid and comfort to those people who think it is a sign of quality to throw out all structure and write a film in which nothing happens and even the characters repeat themselves endlessly.   <br /> <br />In short, beginning screenwriters will find this book less vague than many other beginning books.  The only trap is to avoid both the extremes of (a) thinking that every screenplay has to fit Field's mold or (b) thinking that you can do anything and get away with it.   <br />	2005-02-06

It is a general book on fiction writing.  Second, it is very basic, for beginning writers only.  That said, if you are just starting out, this book has it over the other beginning books in that, at least, it says what it has to say and doesn't beat around the bush.  If you need a cookbook approach, this is it.   <br />It is very brief.  Also, its format is to say what it has to say in bold characters, then repeat the same thing in a couple of paragraphs, as though you were hard of hearing or as though teaching a class of bored students whose minds may have been wandering when he said it the first time.  For instance: \\"The protagonist in a novel can be singular (just the main character) or plural (more than one of the leading characters).\\" (p.11)  Then, just in case that statement was too difficult for you, he spells it out in the next half-page.  And so it goes.  \\"To set the stage for the basic conflict..., place the protagonist in conflict with his own environment or the environment of others.\\" (p.14)  Again, a half page to repeat that.  In other words, you can get all there is in the book just from reading the statements in bold print.  That way, you can finish the book in one hour.   <br />All this might be safe enough, except that some of these bold statements are debatable.  For instance: \\"The basic conflict cannot be developed or sustained unless the author exaggerates the reaction of the protagonist to the stimulus of the environment.\\" (p.20)  \\"The event...that starts the chain of causally related events may or may not be presented in the first chapter.\\" (p.128)  Beware of such advice unless you have a good friend who is an acquisitions editor!   <br />The author touches all the bases: idea, conflict, plot, viewpoint, theme, exposition, description, narration and action, characterization, symbolism.  He also has two brief chapters on \\"craftsmanship\\" in which we are told to \\"Make every word count\\" (p.164)and that \\"The motivation of everything a character says and does in a novel must be established in the reader's mind.\\" (p.158)  And in a chapter on style we are told that \\"Style in novel writing cannot be taught.\\" (.p.187) <br />As long as you go on to read several other beginning books on fiction writing and take many of the proclamations with a grain of salt, it might be safe to read this book.  Certainly, it will get you started quickly.	2005-02-04

This statement is true, of course.  It has to be.  It's a tautology.  \\"Structure\\" and \\"organized\\" are synonyms.  This sentence would be okay, if it were clarified by what follows.  It isn't.  Every sentence is equally vague. \\"Structure is a process.\\"  Wow!  Would a statement like that raise some eyebrows on the people who have spent a lifetime thinking about structure and thinking about process!   <br />Even the discussion of scenes gives very bad advice.  \\"What is the pattern of a scene? ... Statement of goal.  Introduction and development of conflict.  Failure of the character to reach his goal.\\"(p.23)  Anyone who writes scenes like this will have a slow, plodding novel.  Novel writers can learn a lot about scenes from watching movies.  And from reading books on screenwriting.   <br />Finally, some feel that you should worry about structure AFTER you've written your novel.  This is very bad advice (except perhaps for people who have trouble getting anything down on paper at all).  Structure should be done before the first draft.  Otherwise, the seduction of the prose (one's own sacred prose) will prevent you from ever getting your novel into shape.  Besides, designing a novel can itself be a creative process.  It doesn't all have to be in the line-level writing.  Of course, if you're writing academic-literary fiction, then it doesn't matter.  The worse the structure, the better.  But for most writers, creating a good structure will make writing the first draft easier, not harder.  And you can--and should--always be willing to change the structure on the fly when a great idea comes along!	2005-02-03

The chapters treat the usual aspects or problems of characterization: making your character real, motivating your character, giving some background of your character, offbeat characters, heroes, amusing characters, describing characters, characterization through dialogue, characters in unfamiliar settings.  The central thing, says the author, is to make your character care about something-your character, not necessarily your reader.  \\"It doesn't matter whether this something is major or minor, cataclysmic or trivial.\\" (p.1)  Doesn't it?  How is the reader going to feel about a character who cares about something trivial?  According to Swain, this is unimportant.  But be forewarned: it may be important to your reader if you choose such a protagonist for your novel.   <br />Further: \\"Finding a character means...giving human form to aspects of yourself that you like, or dislike, or wish you had. ... all your characters are you.\\" (p. 7)  Besides the fact that many would disagree with this recommendation, it is risky advice.   <br />The details of each chapter also will be familiar to anyone who has read other books on writing: give the sex, age, vocation and manner. (p. 15)  \\"Manner is...style.\\" (p. 16)   And so it goes.  How do you do characterization?  Adjectives and incidents. (p. 18)   This is the kind of vanilla advice this book consists of.  \\"It's to your advantage to consider the tastes and prejudices of your particular audience.\\" (p. 54)  Such redundant statements are not so much untrue as they are unhelpful.  To make your character likeable: \\"The character is striving to attain something.  ...The character is today-slanted.... The character does not contradict readers' feelings or their basic beliefs.\\"  If only if were that simple!   <br />In sum, if you haven't read many books on fiction-writing, you can get the basic ideas from this book, but you run the risk of thinking that you know how to do characterization after you finish.  You won't.  You'll only know some of the kinds of thing you can do.  And even then, you won't have a clue which work better for your purposes than others.	2005-02-02

There's the risk.   <br />The discussion of theme follows--if you'll forgive the expression--the same pattern.  \\"Theme is...the central concern around which a story is structured.\\" (p. 97)  It is your \\"inertial guidance system.\\"  It is a \\"viable, working pattern.\\"  There are exactly five types of theme (no more and no less): theme as plot, theme as emotion effect, theme as style, theme as character, theme as idea.  Got it?  Good.  This book is for you.  But if you're saying, \\"Huh? Say what?\\", then you'd better find some book that knows what it's talking about well enough to say it clearly.	2005-02-02

Part of the padding is in the chatty conversational way the author presents the material.  Part of it is in the numerous examples used.  And here lies the danger.  Kress assumes that if the author is famous, anything the author writes is an example of good writing.  She also ignores any distinctions between so-called \\"literary\\" authors and popular authors and presents examples from both, so long as they are famous.  But most readers are bored by so-called \\"literary\\" writing (and with good reason), so using these examples as models of how to do characterization is risky at best.   <br />Also, maybe because the passages are chosen as illustrations, most of the examples of characterization are descriptive passages or other \\"telling\\" passages-in other words, they are static.  The story stops while this character is being introduced or is being given another coating of \\"characterization.\\"  This is a poor way to do characterization.  Some of the examples give you an impression of the character.  The question is, would you want to stop your story to do it, or can you find an equally effective way that does not stop the story?  And what is most important about characterization anyway?  These questions Kress does not address.  Instead, she surveys all the possibilities and lets you choose.   <br />Of course, like any book on writing, you can get ideas from this book.  So, you might consider buying it, as long as you take care not to be seduced by the examples given and fall into the trap of using these techniques even though you're writing a popular novel.	2005-02-02

The assumption is that being in his course caused them to be successful.  Was it?  Probably successful filmmakers sit in on a lot of courses.  Everybody can use one more good idea.  Did they learn their craft from McKee?  Be wary of assuming they did.   <br /> <br />First of all, understand that this book, large as it is, covers only the basics of screenwriting. You may not want to read it first, but do not consider it the last book you'll ever need to read.  The book deals with \\"Structure and Setting\\", \\"Structure and Genre,\\" \\"Structure and Character,\\" \\"Structure and Meaning,\\" \\"The Substance of Story,\\" the inciting incident, act design, scene design, scene analysis, composition, crisis, climax, resolution, \\"the principle of antagonism\\", exposition, problems and solutions, character.   <br /> <br />\\"Structure is a selection of events from the characters' life stories...\\" (p.33).  \\"A story event creates meaningful change in the life situation of a character...\\" (p.33) \\"Story values are universal qualities of human experience...\\" (p.34)  \\"To plot means to navigate through the dangerous terrain of story and when confronted by a dozen branching possibilities to choose the correct path.\\" (p.43)  And so it goes.  Such truisms make the book read like Spinoza, except that Spinoza distinguished between theorems and postulates, and all of McKee's propositions are postulated.  McKee then jumps from these bland truism to discuss movies that most people would have mixed feelings about (at best).  He assures us that these movies exhibit the desirable properties he is talking about, and the vagueness with which his truisms are stated make this sleight of hand possible.  But none of this is helpful to the would-be screenwriter.   <br /> <br />Second, the book, throughout, is based on the assumption that you (meaning everyone) agree with McKee on his value judgments of movies. If you were less thanthrilled with some of the movies he cites, you should be wary of the advice he gives. His value prejudices are usually subtle but are sometimes blatant. For example, he cites \\"Tender Mercies\\" as an example of plot (p.43-44).  This movie did appeal to some viewers (though not to others), but whatever its appeals, plot is not one of its strong points.  More generally, he cites every movie that attained any degree of fame as a successful example-though he does not tell us in what way they were successful or how many viewers regarded them as such.  So, we have \\"Un Chien Andalou\\", \\"Last Year at Marienbad,\\" \\"Paris, Texas\\", etc. as exemplary films.   <br /> <br />One reason people read this book is to find out how the people who run the film industry currently think.  But the book may not be as au courant as one might think.  McKee says that \\"writers rush to their typewriters\\" (p.15).  No writer has rushed to a typewriter in over 20 years.   <br /> <br />Also, some of McKee's tastes are one-sided.  For example: \\"Comedy is at heart an angry, antisocial art.\\" (page 360). Well, for some people it is. You might call these films, \\"ill-humored comedy\\". But there are many other comedies that are not angry, nasty and hostile. Are these comedies therefore bad?  <br /> <br />By not recognizing audience differences, McKee can be dogmatic about how to write a screenplay (and he is). His main support for his value judgments is in the movie examples he cites. But if you were less than thrilled with some of these movies, you'll have to take his advice with a grain of salt.   <br />Still, there is a lot of basic information that few could quarrel with. If you are a beginning screenwriter, you could well invest in this book.  You need to read a number of books anyway, so that the tastes of one author are counter by others.	2005-01-30

Today, a number of books have gone beyond this book on the problem of characterization, so the book is dated.  And since the book is very brief, it is not as in-depth as the title makes it appear.   <br />The discussion of point of view follows the all-too-familiar pattern of listing the possibilities and discussing each one.  First person and third person are the two main categories, with omniscient, limited omniscient, and shifting as subheads.  Only a few words about the advantages of each and these are the same found in most introductory books on fiction writing.  You want to use the most effective point of view, so you'll need to get another book to tell you which those are and to show you why.  Still, if you've read only an introductory book on fiction writing, this might be a good next step.	2005-01-29

Dibell says, \\"Plot is the things people do, feel, think, or say, that make a difference to what comes afterward. ...  if it has significant consequences.\\" (p.6)  Well, yes and no.  It depends.  And therein lies the problem.  Dibell has not really got at what makes some elements of fiction plot and other, similar elements, not plot.   <br />She discusses \\"openings,\\" viewpoint, exposition, \\"middles\\" and subplots, \\"big scenes\\", \\"melodrama\\" (which she defines as \\"large things grappling and clashing\\" (p.7), patterns, pacing, transitions, endings.  There's also a final chapter \\"beyond plot\\" about static novels: the mood piece, the character sketch, the slice of life, the collage, etc.  Dibell does her best to make these sound like good ideas, good techniques to use.  So, beginning writers need to be forewarned not to take this too seriously, unless they want to remain unpublished.   <br />If you haven't read too many books on fiction writing already, this book is still worth checking out.  The chapter on \\"Melodrama\\" (or what most people would call \\"fantasy\\" or \\"sci-fi\\") is especially useful.	2005-01-29

Frey challenges and provokes in an effort to get writers to re-examine what they're doing and try to do it better.  He discusses \\"the fictive dream and how to induce it,\\" suspense, memorable characters, \\"premise\\", narrative voice, and the author-reader contract.  By \\"premise\\" he means \\"a brief statement of what happens to the characters as a result of the actions of the story.\\" (p.51).  He points out common mistakes with these, but just how \\"advanced\\" his tidbits of information are-that is another matter.  For example, nothing in the chapter on suspense should be news to someone who has read a few books on fiction writing.   <br />Also, \\"the seven deadly mistakes\\": timidity, trying to be literary, ego-writing, failure to re-dream the dream, failure to keep faith with yourself, etc.   <br />His guiding examples of damn good novels are Jaws, The Red Badge of Courage, Gone with the Wind, The Trial (Kafka), Crime and Punishment, and Carrie (Stephen King).  Most of the time, Frey's own tastes dictate what constitutes a damn good book and, thus, how one ought to write, so all of his advice needs to be taken with a few grains of salt.  Also, there is a great deal more that can be said about fiction writing that this book does not say.  The book is also short.  Bottom line: you need to read other books too.	2005-01-29

He discusses \\"Premise\\", Stakes, Time and Place, Characters, Plot, \\"Contemporary Plot Techniques\\" (\\"nonlinear\\" narratives, character-driven stories), \\"Multiple Viewpoints, Subplots, Pace, Voice, Endings\\" (all in one chapter), \\"Advanced Plot Structures\\" (generational novels, whole life novels, historical novels, linked short stories), and Theme.  His chapter on Stakes is particularly useful.  <br />The problem I have with the book is the usual one: that the book assumes that every reader (and the would-be writer reading this book) has more or less the same tastes. Some of the books held up as exemplary novels to learn from, I found appalling.  <br />Another problem is the occasional attempt to pander to the avant-garde. An example is \\"Nonlinear Narrative\\". There is no discussion/evaluation of this experimental technique. Nor is there any mention of how few readers there are for such material. But that's okay, because the matter is immediately dropped after two pages anyway, and it's back to the thrillers again.  <br />Still, even when he's rehashing the same old ABCs, Maass does so in a lively way. So, beginning writers will certainly learn much from this book.  And it is a valid point that Maass has not written a \\"breakout\\" novel himself, so how could this book tell us all we need to know to do it!  It doesn't, but that does not mean that there isn't some useful information in the book.   <br />No serious writer should read only one book on writing. The only protection from the author's tastes is to read a variety of books--not as easy as it sounds because most of them have the same tastes and most say the same things in different words and with different examples.	2005-01-27

Because it confines itself to character emotions, it can go into more detail than the usual omnibus book.  This is also its weakness.   <br />She begins with a 15 page essay on writing about emotions.  How to do it wrong: clichs, lack of specificity, ambiguity (which she, unaccountably, equates with labeling), \\"not trusting your characters\\" (meaning, lack of consistency or \\"too consistent\\").  How to do it right gets a little vague, but fresh language, the power of suggestion, dialogue, interior monologue, showing an emotion by \\"indirect\\" behavior (i.e. displacement) are the right ways.   <br />She then has one chapter each on 36 different emotions: anger, fear, grief, guilt, etc, but including worry, resignation, surprise, sympathy.  Each chapter is about 4 pages long-much too short to be very useful.  The bad examples given first are obvious, but they need to be. And many beginning writers make these mistakes, so they need to be shown.  The good examples are useful, but sometimes debatable, illustrating that conveying character emotions is a nontrivial task. The exercises are reasonable, but how will a writer know when she is doing it well?   <br />This is also a very short book.  Still, it should make every writer think before charging ahead and merely assuming that because the writer feels it, the reader also is going to feel it. Think again!	2005-01-27

Twentieth century authors like Kafka, Joyce, Eliot, etc. were taught so as to challenge the complacent minds of middle-class students (p. 60).  However, being taught in college conferred on these works a status that made them guides for behavior rather than stimulation for discussion.  Students unquestioningly accepted the negative attitudes in these authors (p. 61) and the dark view of life they offered.  When the view became even darker and completely irrational and self-destructive in the late twentieth century, the authority conferred by their being taught in college still swayed the students.   <br /> <br />What to do about all this is something that eludes Kernan.  He needs information which he, as a retired English professor from Princeton, does not have.  He continues the traditional antipathy to all other fields, particularly the physical and social sciences.  For instance, Kernan equates the relativity of Relativity Theory with the relativity of cultural anthropology (p. 80-81), even citing \\"uncertainty and probability\\" as marks of this relativity!  One consequence of this is Kernan's grouping reader-response theories among the bad guys.  \\"Reader-response or reception aesthetics drain the autonomous work of art of its meaning by relocating the meaning-making power to the eyes of the beholders.\\" (p. 76)  This statement presupposes that a work can have no meaning unless it has the same meaning for every reader, certainly a debatable, not to say dubious point.   <br /> <br />So, his book continues to the end as a kind of lament.  He has no solutions to offer.  And indeed, turning backthe clock to the mindless Traditionalism of the past is no more a solution than continuing the mindless iconoclasm and interest-group politicking of the present.  For a book that is able to deal with these problems (because the author is not a traditionalist and has a knowledge of other fields), see A Book Worth Reading.  Still, Kernan scores some points against the iconoclasts which could occasion useful debate, but it is unlikely that they will ever read his book.   <br />	2004-12-28

There might be agreement in a dozen countries that Cervantes, Herodotus and Homer are classical, but there is no agreement even in this country that writers like Ulrich, DeLillo, Gilroy, and Rita Dove constitute a classical or even a liberal education.  Juxtaposing classics with recent writing of dubious merit insinuates that these writers too are \\"classical\\" and therefore good.  You should educate your children at home, precisely in order to avoid their being subjected to writers like DeLillo and the others.

And as usual, he bends over backward to be fair to everybody.  He gives patient, exhaustive treatments of all arguments and claims, even the most idiotic, showing their inadequacies.  But people who put forth idiotic arguments do not do so because they are stupid but because they are committed, and committed people do not respond to reason, however patient and thorough.  Still, there is much thought-provoking material here, and the book should be read by all readers interested in the personal and social effects of literature.  Booth is weakest when dealing with philosophical issues (because he is not a philosopher).  His confusions about subjectivism and relativism are cases in point.  For a competent discussion of these and the other ethical (i.e. value-theoretic) issues, readers would be better advised to get A Book Worth Reading.  But as a compendium of arguments \\"clearing away the dead wood\\" and for his many thought-provoking discussions, Booth is impossible to beat.	2004-12-24

To readers who have studied philosophy, this book--when dealing with such questions--has an undergraduate feel to it like a term paper (for instance, her tendency to quickly gravitate to the most general terms).  She is also not informed on the politics of the field of philosophy.  For example, she accepts Richard Rorty's claim that he is a pragmatist.  (Rorty is an ordinary language philosopher who, like others of his school, adopted the label of another philosophical school because those schools had been weeded out of philosophy departments by the end of the 1980s.) So, her discussions of \\"pragmatism\\" have nothing to do with pragmatism.  Readers with some knowledge of philosophy would be advised to read a book by authors who know what they are talking about, such as A Book Worth Reading.  When marshalling the terminology of literary theory, however, Herrnstein Smith is in her element and wields the jargon with the best of them.  She criticizes others of her kind, wowing them with references to Kant and Hume, \\"feedback loops\\" and \\"economies\\" and \\"axiological logic\\".  She also dazzles naïve readers with her \\"logic.\\"  For instance, in reply to the counterargument (p. 112) that her claim (that there is no truth) is self-refuting because if no statements are true, then her statements are not true--she replies that this argument \\"begs the question\\"! (and thus betrays that she does not know what a circular argument is).  She justifies this dodge by arguing that she is allowed to assert contradictions because she is offering an \\"alternative description.\\" (p. 113)  Overall, if you think that claims about the sad state of current literary theory are exaggerated, you should read this book.	2004-12-24

Besides merely correcting the lies of well-meaning but misguided academics, though, we need to understand why they are putting out these lies about American history.  What is going on behind the scenes in history departments and how did these people get so much power in the first place?  Simple guesses won't do.  You need to read other books to find this out.  Maybe understanding them will help to fight them.  Simple demonizing won't do either.

Most of them are written by literary academics.  This one is by a philosopher.  The significance of this difference is in the tools which the author brings to bear on the problems or on his intolerance of slipshod thinking and sleights of hand.  This book is also rare in that respect.  The usual attitude of professional philosophers to Derrida is to let his arguments \\"fall of their own weight.\\"  However, fervently held beliefs do not fall of their own weight or even by the weight of argument.  Ellis is to be complimented, therefore, for the extreme patience he shows in plodding through every detail of the claims of Deconstructionism and painstakingly refuting each one.  This book will, of course, have no effect on the true believers.  Nothing will.  But for the undecided and the not-yet-converted this book may be a lifesaver.  In the end, Ellis concludes that genuine theory \\"ought to employ analysis rather than rhetorical drama.\\" (p. 158).  Instead, in Deconstructionism, \\"theory\\" becomes in large measure a new vehicle through which older, unthinking attitudes are clung to and genuine change resisted.\\" (p. 154)  Ellis' book is analytical rather than constructive.  For constructive answers to the problems that led to Deconstructionism and the other newer attempts at theory, see A Book Worth Reading.	2004-12-17

On the other hand, the book was published in 1984, before academia had become the place it is now.  The novel is also slow by American standards, taking its time with each scene, including scenes that make the reader wonder why the scenes are there at all.  One reviewer commented on this being a rare novel about academia.  It is that.  But academia now is not the place it was twenty years ago.  What has happened in America has also happened in the U.K, as Small World makes clear.  These people are networking on an international scale.  Perhaps, Lodge thought these literary ideas were so silly they would blow over in a short time and he could laugh them out of existence.  (\\"Then, what's it all for?!\\")  But the grim-faced neoMarxist of the present universities have no sense of humor and are not about to be laughed out of their entrenched positions of power.

The poetry is better in Wolfe; the prose better in Byatt.  The story line gives a strong boost to the book, but don't expect what you saw in the movie.  The movie handles the mystery much better, and it shows rather than tells the past story glimpse by glimpse.

He wants to expose the closed-mindedness and indoctrination that are going on in the humanities/arts/education/religion/\\"studies\\" departments in almost all American universities.  Unfortunately, he is not equipped to do this task.  His method is to visit a campus, state at length what he thinks is wrong, quote verbatim and at length from an interviewee who has the same opinion, then move on to another interviewee or another university.  The opposition could use the same method to show that things are perfect on campus!  Also, his owns prejudices sometimes get aired as though they were as obvious as the issues of free speech and unfettered inquiry, as some of the reviewers here have fastened on.  The fact is, we know from other books like The Rape of Alma Mater that the things this author portrays are happening.  Undecided readers would do better to consult those other books first.

It is not a rigorous survey based on random sampling, etc.  But then, it does not pretend to be.  It is a passionate plea for freedom of inquiry.  And one of the ways this book transcends other books in this area is that it goes beyond the universities and deals with thought control in the media--and the media are areas which the author knows from personal experience.  If you want a more rigorous account from a liberal, read Who Stole Feminism? or The Shadow University.  And if you want the whole story, including how such an extraordinary takeover could have come about in this country, read The Rape of Alma Mater, a fictionalized but fact-based account.	2004-12-09

Before this book, few people had a clue that college as they knew it no longer existed.  Most people still don't.  Yes, we can fault Bloom: he gushes over the wonders of ancient writers without giving any concrete arguments why they should be considered wonderful, and so on.  But he also gives some harrowing specifics.  And he turned a spotlight on a serious menace.  If you want to know in what ways the situation got worse after the '80s, you need to read Illiberal Education, Who Stole Feminism? and others.  This collection of books will also serve to refute the usual closed-minded claims that objections to the status quo come only from Conservatives.  This is not about Conservativism, though Conservatives think it is.  It is about education.  And if you read the recent book, The Rape of Alma Mater, you'll learn that the situation has gotten so bad, we can now say it is about the survival of this country.  Yes, it's that bad.

But in this case, the two Davids have an ally: the U.S. court system.  Taking college after college to court, the pair not only obtained results exonerating those faculty and students denied their rights of free speech and due process but logged some blistering denunciations of the colleges for their denial of basic Constitutional rights from the judges who heard the cases.  Kors and Silvergate have since set up a website where students and teachers can register what is being done to them.  Visit it at [...] and read some of what's happening.  If that doesn't scare you, don't bother watching Frankenstein.      They have also set up a new website, [...] where students can find information on how to defend and protect their own rights on campus.      The only thing one can say against the book is that its focus is so restricted.  But that is also the book's strength.  For a full and thorough account of what is going on and how it got that way, you need to read other recent books on the subject, such as The Rape of Alma Mater.  One of the nice things about The Shadow University is that the two authors are liberals.  This is not some biased conservative ranting.      It's a pity that conservatives don't read this book and find out what true liberalism is.  If they did, maybe they'd stop calling the people who have taken over the colleges \\"liberals.\\"  And maybe true liberals would stop thinking that the current power elite are liberals and that it is the duty of every right-thinking person to agree with them.	2004-11-24

First of all, where other authors bob and weave about exactly what you should do, Al hits you in the face with it.  If you agree, fine.  If you disagree, better get some other book.  For instance, he lays out his value criteria: \\"high stakes; larger-than-life characters; a strong dramatic question; a high concept; a farfetched plot premise; intense emotional involvement between several point-of-view characters; and an exotic and interesting setting.\\"   <br />Really, there's the whole book for you in a nutshell.  In separate chapters, he elaborates each of these elements.  If you're not sure you want to base your novel on a farfetched premise?  Or have larger-than-life characters?  Well, you have a problem. <br />He also devotes about a quarter of this rather short book to discussing in detail the re-writing of one of Ken Follett's novels. If you don't want to write the type of novel Follett writes, better choose some other writing book.  <br />Still, if you can afford one more book on writing, this one might challenge some of your assumptions and provoke you to make your novel just a little more gripping.	2004-08-30

Do we really need to hear all about Stein's experience with Jimmy Hoffa just to learn that a book written in voice is more lively than one written in impersonal prose?  Anyone who has reached the level that they are considering reading this book probably knows that already.  In any case, what is needed is HOW to write in a voice, not the vanilla advice to do so.   <br />Of course, if you have plenty of money and plenty of time, there are probably a few tidbits in this book that may be new to you.  And if you are a beginner, you'll of course benefit from hearing the ABCs expounded by this confident pro.	2004-08-30

For those interested in writing for readers (termed by academics the \\"popular\\" novel), this book could well be highly misleading.  The fact that Burroway and others such as Macauley & Lanning think that the same basic principles apply but that \\"literary\\" fiction goes beyond--this fact shows that they understand neither popular fiction nor yet \\"literary\\" fiction.  In fact, the two are based on diametrically opposed principles and have largely opposite criteria of quality.<br /><br />Also, bear in mind that you are getting only the ABCs in this book.  This is a first book, not a last book.<br /><br />That said, the exposition is clear and there are numerous examples (all from academic-literary fiction).  Whether it is worth the price--ah, that is another question.	2004-08-29

It doesn't.  In the interim, Seger has acquired advance degrees in New Age theology (yes, really) and has become Dr. Seger.  This book turns its back on three-act structures and rising action and throws its support entirely behind post-x film-making.  She can use (some) Academy Award-winning films (from the last twenty years only) because people with the post-x mentality have gained considerable influence in the Academy in those years and have given these disjoint and depressing films the Awards.  If that's the type of screenplay you want to write, then this book is for you, and it's one of the few that deals with this type of screenwriting. You'll also need connections in the industry to get your play produced because, unless they are given an Award, they lose money.  So, only a close friend is going to be willing to put up the millions to make your film.   <br />But if you want to write for the other 95% of the movie-going public, you'll need her former books and others like them.	2004-08-07

The author allows you into Jackie's heart, so that you know what she's feeling and how she sees what is happening to her.  As soon as you think things have settled down, a completely believable surprise happens to plunge Jackie into more trouble.  Jackie is a believably real person, and the surprise unmasking of the attorney is handled so deftly and yet so believably that, for drama and impact, it ranks with the unmasking scene in Phantom of the Opera.	2003-08-22
