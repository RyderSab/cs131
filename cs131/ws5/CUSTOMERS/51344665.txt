It has the usual, welcomed Martini hallmarks.<br />The Attorney is a little different than the others in the series in that the protagonist did not spend as much time discussing his family issues. Some of you will be happy about that, but Martini missed out on an opportunity to touch on the single parenting of a pre-teen.<br />Harry Hinds remains in the series, unfortunately not as prominently. He always added a certain kind of odd, understated comic relief. He's like the 'Kramer' to Madriani's 'Seinfield.'<br />Some people might complain about the ending, but I liked the ironic twist. Most of Martini's endings are way over the top and, in the case of Undue Influence, the endings can be too much of a reach. This ending fell together pretty neatly in the attorney.<br />Enjoy this book! I'm the kind of reader who stops reading most suspense books by chapter two because they aren't that good. Martini's courtroom books are always entertaining and compelling.	2001-06-04

This book should've been Martini's best, however the metaphors are more numerous than usual and Martini's insistence on surprising endings gets in the way. If an editor was more involved on this manuscript, you, the reader, would get reddened eyes from non-stop reading.	2001-03-10

All the other Amazon reviewers have it right: it is a wonderful menagerie of characters as sized up by the narrator. <br />What I can add to the list of reviews is the striking parallels to Conrad's Heart of Darkness. You have an odd-job protagonist who, along with is unique travelling companions, goes on a strange journey into the Mexican jungle to search for a missing  friend. Along the way, he encounters excesses in human behavior, archeological adventurers, cultists and hippies. At the end of his journey, he finds a self-styled Captain Kurtz-like character: a self-imposed spiritual shaman-cum-criminal. Note that this is not the character that the protagonist is tracking down, but it does lead to an unexpected climax. Of course, the journey really isn't the point to the novel. The point is to capture all the colorful personalities along the way - Portis succeeds marvelously!	2000-11-26

It's one of those very rare books that inspire me to make changes - no easy feat, as I am a hard case. In very short order, the author inspired me to look at my failures, behaviors and the shadows that haunt me, make me face the truth about all of the above, and think of an action plan on how to make changes in my life. <br />Much of the book is devoted to necessity of pause and reflection as an energizer to face working life's challenges - but there are several more gems buried in this short text.	2000-10-31

This book features more courtroom scenes, more character, more politics than any of the others Martinis. It's a thrill to listen to Madriani argue his client out of the worst corners in the courtroom. I also sense the institutional horrors of the legal system when I read these books. I appreciated the ending - it was no heroic, death defying duel that some of the other Madriani books include. Check it out.	2000-10-29

What I like about his work is how he portrays the LAPD as a diseased institution - a cuckhold of the media, city politics and all the heavy infighting that go on inside the  LAPD. Then you have Bosch, who manages to doggedly pursue his cases while  limboing through the precarious balance of the LAPD political sphere. Bosch  manages to do this while keeping a cool head, keeping his wits about him  and meeting his deadlines. <br />The narration is fast, lean and  spare.<br />Black Ice is interesting because Bosch is teaming up with other  law enforcement agencies: the DEA and the Calexico PD. We get a convincing  glimpse of law enforcement in Mexico. We also get a rollercoaster of a  climax when the DEA makes a helicopter raid on a heroin ranch in Mexico.	2000-06-19

I find Bosch to still be the tough and sharp character that he always was. I also think that the dialogue is more plentiful and crisper compared to the earlier  works. What's different are the stories. They aren't serial murders  anymore. Since there is not a murder happening regularly, we get more time  with Bosch. We understand him a little more. We also get to encounter more  of those maddening politics inside the LAPD, city hall, the public mob and  the LA media machine. Those will get you more riled up than the crimes!  Connelly does a stellar job at portraying Bosch fighting to solve cases  while dealing with all the other forces dogging him in the name of  &quot;going along to get along.&quot;	2000-06-14

The dialogue has some spark.<br />Besides good characters, Erdman is good with the technical details  of finance. You get to dabble with offshore corporation, shell companies,  underwriting and the like. It does not read like a textbook. It reads more  like what you can imagine Micheal Milken doing in a meeting with his  minions as he's setting up something - lots of charisma, some financial  details, but not so much details that it would put us laypeople to  sleep.<br />His other books are like this, too. Except for the Swiss Account  (which reads like a history book) and The Panic of 89 (which reads like a  Tom Clancy thriller).	2000-06-07

It's obviously a first effort by someone more schooled in accountancy than in writing. Every obvious device is employed. The  protagonist does every stupid thing you can imagine. For example: his  friend is murdered, he gets his hands covered with his friend's blood, he  goes back to his friend's office while smearing his friend's blood (and his  own fingerprints) on doorknobs and stuff. If I can recall, he took the  weapon used on his friend and puts it back in his friend's office. C'mon.  How stupid can a book get?	2000-03-29

Excitement. The trial scenes were great. 4. Style. I like how  Martini sizes things up.<br />The book is an easy read. In fact, Martini could  have fleshed out the book with more information and twists and the story  would still be taught. What he managed to do is only admit critical  elements to the story to make it a story and keep it engaging. I hope to  read more of his works.	2000-01-21

What it is is mayhem garnished with some good ol' boy redneck-speak. Hunter has some potential but he could've whittled the book down to half its current size. There are internal dialogues that are too often and too  long, extraneous characters and lots of descriptions to the feature sets on  firearms. Hunter tried to size up characters, which I can appreciate - but  given all the words he devoted to the task, it shows that he was not  efficient or effective at it.<br />At times I think the book wanted to be  funny but I was not sure if it supposed to be funny with gallows humor or  just plain funny. As you might see, I did not find it funny. The  limitations of my humor are such that I don't allow humor in a story that  has brutal scenes of violence perpetrated by amoral characters.	2000-01-17

They are unalike, but their judgements toward each other are mild. They make  comprimises because, when you get down to it, they need each other. They  are alone, lost their mates, or are a heartbeat away from losing their  mates.<br />Aging is a drag, but Alice Adams has a way of softening it. It's  always a pleasure to get to know her characters. She gets inside their  heads and shows (through the help of limited parentheticals) what they are  immediately thinking as they are saying something else. They are not forced  upon us. Tragedies happen in this story, but they aren't the easy emotional  or manipulative bombs that a lesser author would overuse.<br />It's an  engaging read. Unfortunately, this book is not as good as her Superior  Women.	2000-01-12

People love or hate this book. I love this book but I can where some people might object. <br />Why I love it: It is well written, it has many examples, it covers many subjects, it has a sense of humor (many reviewers  do not have a sense of humor) and I found myself referencing this book  as  I took subsequent quantitative-oriented classes in my MBA program.<br />Why  some people may hate it: 1. European MBA programs are much more  quantitatively oriented. The MBAs from Belgium and London tell me that 50%  of their grade in most classes requires proving or deriving a formula. This  book won't tell you how to do that or address those hairy mathmatical  models. 2. Finance practitioners, options traders, investment bankers  aren't wild about this book. It is not in-depth quantitative in its nature.  I don't believe practitioners should be reading a general book such as  this. If they are reading this book, then this should be only one of  several works they should be reading. 3. Finance is hard work! Most of my  MBA peers were blindsided by the amount of effort required by the class (as  I was). Even the Sr. financial analysts in my class were challenged by the  work. If you're not sharp on your math skills, your finance class will make  you choke! Any book that would purport to tell you everything you need to  know for a basic corp. finance class would be a multivolume set! Don't  demand miracles from one textbook!<br />Do yourself a favor: If you do use  this book or subsequent volumes, purchase the study guide and solutions  guide as well! And attend teaching assistant sessions if you can!<br />About  CAPM, APT and WACC: they are addressed in this book. Maybe not to the  extent that they should be, but then again, this book is a survey of  issues. My prof spent lots of time on those subjects even though the book  did not.	2000-01-12

As one of the previous reviewers said, the story is &quot;lite&quot; yet compelling. That is true. But what makes this story much better than other stories of friendships and change is Adams' impressive writing skill. She  can plumb the grey areas of character and motivation while maintaining a  lean, readable style. There are no seeds of parody in this story. The  events are interesting, the relationships are realistic and the author has  an elegant way of displaying the characters' mistakes and foibles without  heavy handed judgement. <br />And if that does not convince you, try this: My  wife was reading a book on coming of age among women.

I've read all of the Joe Gunther mysteries except for Occam's Razor and The Skeleton's Knee. This one if my favorite. It is the most tense and fastest paced out of the bunch. It is also very eerie in that we don't know  or see the criminals except when they strike at one part of the state or  the other. We only hear sketchy details about the criminal's lives as Joe's  squadron does their research and deduction. The criminals in this case are  Asian gang kingpins. Since we don't see them at work, we are spared  stereotypes or other such gaffes. Instead, we get to sense the frustration  that goes into investigating highly mobile, nationally networked, very  sub-rosa criminals. Despite all the investigations, the story moves very  fast. My only complaint is the ending is not satisfactory - it's almost  comic bookish given the dose of reality throughout the story.	1999-12-22

He sets up crimes bereft of any clue except one - and that one clue leads to many more. In this outing, there are ambitious city politicians, CIA spooks, and Russian mafia of all  things. If Mayor was heavy handed or trite, he would have these evil forces  pulling every impossible dirty trick from a comic book you could imagine.  Thankfully, he shows restraint. The writing and dialogue is lean, the story  moves quickly (sometimes too quickly) and there is a cliffhanger type of  ending. One thing that would change my review to five stars is this: I  don't feel a payoff from the climactic endings. All the events leading up  to the finale are satisfactory. <br />Not to readers - you will get the most  satisfaction from these books if you read them in sequence. You will get to  know the characters and understand their motivations and personalities.	1999-12-22

What I can add to what's been said so far is this: the product lifecycle of the disk drive industry as well as the attrition rate of high tech companies is so fast,  that Christensen has excellent data to formulate and defend his position.  He also takes the brave step of venturing into the social science aspect of  managing innovation in a high tech environment - that is, he addresses the  hurdles faced by innovators when they lock horns with their managers.  <br />This is a fast read. You will not waste your time on it. Many articles  in Fortune Magazine now reference Christensen's work when they cover  bricks-and-mortar going to e-commerce. You can easily skip the technology  details and the product timeline charts and still fully understand  Christensen's argument. And even if you hate it or disagree, you have not  spent that much time or money on it.	1999-12-22

I have nothing against turning the standard storytelling method on its head, but this seems to become too self-concious of its objective after  awhile. It's one of those assemblages of barely related observations of the  edgy lives these cops lead. I'm sure it is a hard life, but it does not  necessarily mean good fiction. It's more like a mosaic documentary that is  full of irony. If you're going to do it this way, do it well!

It needs to be whittled down by 50% and the characters need more personality. It has some excitement in the trading scenes, but you have to slog through worthless stuff to get to  them. For example, we go through a long, dull chapter describing a visit to  the narrator's mum, hear a description of his father, his father's death,  etc. and it really is all for naught. I hope his other books are better.  Maybe if he read some Hammet or Hemmingway he can pick up some pointers on  how to make the prose more efficient.	1999-08-25
US	51344665	RH7CC8689A5QR	0380725797	541684449	The Death of an Irish Tinker: A Peter McGarr Mystery (Peter McGarr Mysteries)	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Not the usual work, but still great.	This book did not have its usual satisfying trappings of character development among McGarr and his staff, nor was there any of the procedural/deduction angle that makes this series so enjoyable. It was  heavier on the action (very good at it, too) and there was an interesting  emphasis on the Irish Tinker (Gypsy) culture. A very entertaining read but  you'll get more out of it if you read some of the other McGarrs before you  read this.<br />Note to Gill, nee, McGarrity: Don't leave us hanging on the  Ruthie/Hughie angle! You've got to issue another book in this series!	1999-08-23

The details are used to just the rightaffect. His series isn't much on violence either. Often he's just looking for missing persons and not tripping over corpses.	1999-08-19

Unfortunately, Wet Graves is not his best, although it is more easily found in the USA than others. Try any of his other Cliff Hardy books  before you try Wet Graves. Hint: you can find his other books at secondhand  bookstores (Sorry, Amazon).	1999-08-09

Higgins uses his trademark let-the-dialogue-tell-the-story method to its usual great aplomb. He also allows Jerry Kennedy to reflect more on his life in the law and on his own life in general. Since Higgins is a master  storyteller, you will find yourself very drawn to Kennedy's observations,  character sketches, accomplishments, challenges and  disappointments.<br />There is hardly any courtroom drama (so stay away, it  that is what you want), but there is a good helping in how Kennedy finds an  angle to help him fight an impossible case.	1999-08-03

This week I am reading the Death Of Love. No, I am not dissappointed. In fact, it is an engaging read. It is nice to see the characters grow from the previous story. It is also  nice to see these Irish law enforcers engage in some more covert operations  as opposed to their usual brand of detection found in the other works. And  the writing is just as solid as ever. Check it out.	1999-07-29
US	51344665	R1LM40IA7MVY6U	1886625034	211409837	Deconstruction Acres	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Good voice	Tim Brown has a well controlled voice. He resisted writing about silly college pranks. Instead, he has written a story about people who live on the margin of university life. This is not to say that it is heavy. It is  not. It is wry and ironic, cheerful when it needs to be, bittersweet when  appropriate. I regret that it is more of a short novel. He obviously has  the ability to do a larger story filled with more characters. Tim: don't  end the next one as quickly.	1999-07-26

I collect them - I have thousands in my library. But this has got to be one of the worst fictions I have encountered. Even my wife, who finishes everything she  reads, threw this one down by page 50 or so. I don't know Sanders, but he  must've been taking a holiday when he wrote this.	1999-07-21

Robin, her fictional heroine, sizes up people and situations with lightning speed and acerbic wit. I would pay her to hang out at my office and write about what she sees.<br />The book is a mystery, but I didn't notice. I was more interested in listening to Robin  get herself in trouble with her superiors, insult her detractors and  describe the overall state of her disheveled life.<br />I imagine Hayter can  do well in most genres, both fiction and non-fiction.	1999-07-12

Despite the time it was written, it is not dated. I read this 10 years after it was printed and I howled  with laughter. Gould has a way with words, a keen sense of observation and a breakneck pace.	1998-06-18

This is another installment featuring the sauve yet sarcastic/observant articulate Stuart Hoag. It includes the usual pop culture iconoclasticism (and I can't get enough of that) and the cast of characters that remind me of the Thin Man movies updated to the 1990's.	1998-06-18
