I just couldn't get into it. Finally I made myself stick with it. Once I did that, I just couldn't put it down! I was reading it at Red Lights and in traffic jams! I arrived an hour early for a meeting and it was totally fine with me because I had the book with me. I was actually excited to wait an hour!  <br /> <br />This book has just the right amount of comedy and romance and suspense. I love the wit and candor that came from the 4 women! It was awesome! A definite MUST READ!	2005-09-07

I can't decide really whether I really liked it, or really didn't like it. I thought the story line was a bot flimsy. However, yhe character development was excellent. I found Richard to be very sexy and protective. The love scenes were definitely hot! I liked Paris' character also. I just couldn't wrap my brain around the whole \\"psychic painter\\" thing. <br /> <br />Linda Howard is one of my favorite authors and I make it a point to read everything I can by her.

However, she did a lot of growing up and was much better in her own story. Harlan was too sexy! Sandra did a great job with all the leading men in this trilogy. I had my own private love affairs with Lucky, Chase and Harlan! <br /> <br />Each one of these stories lead into the next and the journey is phenominal! <br /> <br />This is a fantastic trilogy and I am not usually a \\"re-reader\\", but I am keeping this one to read again!	2005-08-25

Marcie just happens to be the one who was driving the car that his wife died in and has been in love with chase herself since grade school.

Okay, first of all, this was my first Karen Robards book and I have a hard time thinking I might read another one. I was so incrdibly disappointed with this story! <br /> <br />1. Why do we have to read the lyrics to songs over and over again? that was ridiculous! I don't need to read entire paragraphs of the lyrics to \\"Ghostbusters\\"! <br />2. I got really annoyed with the fact that she referred to him - even after they had slept together - as Frankenstein!!! What was up with that? <br />3. The ghost that kept appearing was a really silly side plot, especially the ending! (Although, I liked the part with the Mother and Aunt.) <br /> <br />This book took me days and days to read!

He was handsome and even though he worked for the evil doers, he seemed to be a very kind person. <br /> <br />I also figured out the ending way early in the book.

I am a huge Sparks fan so I read this just because. I didn't think I would really enjoy it as much as I have all of his other novels. <br /> <br />The way we get to see inside how the wonderful characters in his novels are developed was the best part for me! I really enjoyed him talking about a certain friend or a certain relative and thinking to myself, \\"so that's where that character came from.\\" That was Cool! <br /> <br />I will recommend that you read all of his novels (the ones that came before Three Weeks anyway) before reading this one.

I had a hard time getting into it until about 1/3 of the way through it. <br /> <br />I have to say you must READ the actual book on this one. I had a hard time finding Alec sexy - which is odd because he seems to be very sexy. However, I listened to the audio version of this book and the person who read it did the most annoying Boston accent for him and it made me dread his lines!

I listened to this one on CD and I was so anxious to get into my car to hear the rest of the story every day! I absolutely loved the storyline. It was great.  <br />The only reason I gave it 4 instead of five is because I thought they could have tied it up in a little prettier of a package. I had two many un answered questions that could have been beautifully answered with one more chapter. <br /> <br />But still one of my favorites.....	2005-06-08

I thought it was creative and inventive. Their romance was hot and steamy and I loved Jace. He took to baby Allison and I thought it was great when he referred to himself as Daddy when speaking to her. I loved it!	2005-06-08

No, romance doesn't normally happen this way, but would we be reading romance novels if we wanted to hear about doing dishes and paying taxes? No, we want a fantasy. <br /> <br />One other reviewer called Deke a letcherous \\"old\\" man. HE'S 43! Is Brad Pitt an \\"old\\" man? He's 41. I guess someone had better call Hollywood and tell them to add some geratol to his regimen.	2005-06-06
