I have read all of Diana Palmers books, but this one was terrible and not up to par with her other stories. I agree with some of the other reviewers that Kingston Roper stinks as any kind of romantic hero and his affair of the \\"mind and heart\\" with his own sister in law left a bitter taste in this readers mouth. I think what really made this so nasty and tacky was the fact that the sister in law Bess was married to his own brother! If I were Elissa, I would have steered clear of this obviously disturbed man and found a real one somewhere else. Also, I wanted to cringe during Kingstons reasonings for marrying Elissa so he could free his guilty conscience and keep away from Bess and her \\"unwanted\\" attentions. I say that loosely because he sure didn't put up much a fight or let Bess know he wanted nothing to do with her. I felt the sex scenes were forced and contrived and once again Kingston's way of proving that he could forget Bess and use Elissa instead. When I read a romance, I want to read about romance. This book lacked it and more.	2003-07-24

Chloe is a \\"pink\\" headed graphic artist and Rocco works in the marketing field. Both meet in an elevator and it is instant lust, which I felt mostly on Chloe's part. Both are parked in the same garage and when Chloe's car doesn't start, Rocco offers to drive her home and Chloe offers him a \\"night cap\\" which Rocco unquestiongly takes her up on. From there on it is mindless sex without much romance at all. Rocco is trying to get rid of the scheming Amy who wants to marry him and Chloe is bitter that she cannot have Rocco again after one weekend of sex. I just did not feel the love \\"vibes\\" or chemistry between Chloe and Rocco as a couple. I hope Susan's next novel will be better because I really look forward to her books. Lately it seems she is becoming hit and miss, with this book falling under the miss category.	2003-07-11

This book deserves more than five stars and it is a keeper! Out of all the hellfire league stories Ms. Jordan has written, this has got to be the tops. Seven years before, Dare and french emigree' Julienne were a young couple in love but were pulled apart by the manipulations of Dare's grandfather who felt that Julienne was not good enough for his grandson. Dare bitterly set out on a course of carnal excess and destruction and Julienne became an actress.<br />Seven years later, Dare finds out that Julienne is in a play and sets out to take revenge for what she did to him seven years earlier, plus find out if she is involved in any treason against the crown. His real motives are pretty clear and that is the fact that he never forgot about his first love and wants to make her his for all time. Julienne never forgot the love she shared with Dare and agrees to help him flesh out the infamous Caliban that you have read about in previous books. I was enthralled by the sexual chemistry,love and romance these two shared and hated for their story to end. If you love romance, sensual sex and adventure in your romance novels, then you need to pick up a copy of this book. You will not be disappointed.	2003-07-10

Actually I thought Cash Grier was a much better hero then wimpy Judd any day and found myself rooting for Crissy to give him a chance instead of Judd!<br />Crissy and Judd's relationship starts out with him marrying her when she is sixteen in order to keep their failing ranch together with the stipulation that there will be an annullment when she turns 21. Judd secretly loves Crissy but thinks she is too young and hasn't lived her life yet. <br />Flash up to five years and Crissy is on the verge of turning 21. She has tried everything over the years to get Judd to notice her as a woman but has failed. While Crissy lives on the ranch, Judd has taken an apartment in Victoria near his job and to stay out of temptations way. There is also a murder/mystery inserted to liven things up, but you kind of know who the culprit is during the first part of the book.<br />Diana introduces a new character, the actress Tippy Moore who comes with a crew to film a movie on Judd and Crissy's ranch because the two are in dire need of funds. She is obnoxious, mean and snippy, just the right antagonist to keep Judd and Crissy apart. Like an idiot, Judd uses her to keep Crissy at a distance and Tippy has her own reasons for using Judd.We find out later that she has alot of hang ups and issues which is suppose to excuse all the nasty and spiteful things she says and does to Crissy. I wasn't buying it and felt no sympathy for her when everything was revealed. Crissy starts seeing/using Cash Grier who treats her like a queen when Judd blows her off. I really felt that these two should have been the main couple in this book because of the chemistry they had together. I really enjoyed Cash who was more sophisticated and knew how to treat a woman.<br />All and all this book could have been better if Judd had been written differently and Crissy less \\"melting\\"/forgiving everytime he was in the vicinity. I can hardly wait for Cash's story and hope that he is written with the same personality as hewas in this book.	2003-07-08

This book would have been romantic and spellbinding IF Ms. Laurens had not written Sebastian as an adulterer after marrying his beloved Helena in her later books. I just couldn't get pass this and it made this read all the more disappointing. There is absolutely NO WAY the Sebastian portrayed in this book would ever cheat on the love of his life. As the other reviewers stated, nothing was ever plausibly written as to why he did this and because of it, fathered a son by another woman. The Promise in a Kiss has alot going for it if you can get pass this flaw.	2002-11-15

I read this book years ago and enjoyed it during that time, but when I reread it recently, I cringed at the abusive behavior of the lead character Jason and the head in the sand, unreal behavior of the heroine Kate and wondered what I ever thought was good about it. I was actually embarrassed at the behaviors of both characters and skimmed through much of the book just to get through it. The story starts out with the same old plot of the couple knowing each other for years, the hero was done wrong by another woman, so lets take it out on the poor, virginal heroine who knows nothing about anything plot. Jason just flat out stinks as any kind of romantic lead at all. He verbally and emotionally punishes Kate for his \\"growing\\" feelings toward her and she just sits back and takes it! This man has the audacity to have sex with this young woman and then \\"punishes\\" her by staying away because he doesn't want marriage. I would severely recommend to all readers to skip this book if you have not read it. This is more like a battlefield than a romance and you will be disappointed.	2002-11-07

How many people buy a ROMANCE book for anything other than the main characters and to read about their road to true love? I disagree with some of the negative reviews written about this book below. This is my first Suzanne Enoch book and I found it to be romantic, funny and page turning. <br />Georgianna and Tristan (Lord Dare)have know each other for years. When she was a young debutante, a scandalous wager got out of hand, devastating Georgianna and causing the pair to become (adversaries). After six years had passed, Georgianna decides that Tristan needs to be taught a lesson because he is pursuing a young heiress (due to financial troubles) named Amelia and does not want the same thing to happen to another young lady as it did to her. Georgianna sets out to lure Tristan into her scheme by making him fall in love with her and then dumping him as she felt he did to her years ago. The question is, who is seducing who? <br />This was a good book, maybe a bit far fetched at times, but good none the less. I would recommend it to anyone that loves to read romantic comedies.	2002-09-21

It is so refreshing to see an erotic romance novel with a good story and mind blowing sex. The best part for me is that James and Genevieve are exclusive with each other (except for the f/f scene for James to watch) which made the whole plot all the better. There is no rough sex but alot of sexy bondage and played out erotic fantasies. From the bare butt motorcycle ride to the \\"auction\\", this book had me enthralled from page to page. I absolutely loved the ending, but hated for it to end. This book is a keeper for sure and I would recommend it to others if you like this kind of erotic romance.	2002-09-21

I am really not into timid heroines who bow down to the alpha male, but in this particular story, it was not really hard to understand why Elena acted as she did. The story starts out in the year 1070 when a norman soldier (Aimery) abducts a saxon maiden (Elena) from a convent and takes her to his castle to be a slave for himself and his mistress Isobel. Elena has led a very sheltered life and as she states in the book (has always followed what she was told to do whether from the nuns or as a slave for Aimery.) The hero does come off as a doltish brute who thinks only of his pleasure but soon mellows out when he starts to think of Elena as more than just a slave. Isobel soon becomes jealous of Aimery's obsession with Elena and sets out to get rid of her rival with sex, lies and trickery. I really did not think this was a bad read and the sex more than made up for the heroines timidness.	2002-09-09

This book will grab you from the first chapter when Kate walks in on her two roomates (Bad boy Sean and Sweet Joe) having sex in her bed. At first she is totally shocked and upset that they would do this in her room, but then she becomes turned on and joins them, thus beginning an emotional, love/hate filled journey of sexual awakening and a lasting friendship between all three. At first I could not even imagine how this relationship could work out, but Ms. Holly gave it her special touch that made it believable and an enjoyable read. I was never into m/m sex scenes, but this book really made the experience erotic and gave me a better understanding that love comes to those no matter what sex you are. I look forward to more of Emma's books and other Black Lace titles I have yet to read.	2002-08-27

This paranormal story starts out 800 years ago with two lovers destined for tragedy and ends up in the present time to begin a love story between two people (Think Blades Lady) who have some kind of connection to the past (reincarnation) that help them build a future together. The sex scenes are very sensual and romantic plus the plot is very interesting and does not drag out. I honestly bought this book for Fiona's story and although the others are good, this one topped the others by far. I highly recommend this book.	2002-08-19

That I am a long time lover of Diana Palmer, have all of her books and have enjoyed reading her stories up until the past few years when her plots seem to be recycled from other books she has already written. I have to agree with some of the reviewers below that the same old Virginal,sexually ignorant, Bad sex experience, dowdy dressed 21-28 year old woman with hang ups has gown tiresome and lame. I was hoping against hope that Diana would not write Cord and Maggie as the same vapid, stale characters as in previous books but was disappointed that they turned out that way.<br />Eight year old Maggie and Sixteen year old Cord were raised together as foster siblings by a woman called Amy. Eighteen years have passed and both had married on the rebound and lost their spouses to suicide and a drunk driving accident. Guilt and secrets are major factors in the relationship between Maggie and Cord and it puts them at odds with each other along with an intense attraction both feel for one other, but will not admit. <br />I thought the premise of the story about child slavery was a subject that really needed to be addressed and Diana did that well, but the hokey actions of the lead characters ruined it for me. The sex scenes were not sensual at all and read more like a sex education manual for beginners. Another thing that bothered me is that Cord is portrayed as a very sexy, good looking man that could have anyone he wanted, yet doesn't date much at all. I found this a bit far fetched as I did Maggie's ignorance about sex.<br />I would love to see Diana go back to her roots and write as she did as Diana Blayne (candelight ectasy) or Susan Kyle. Her romances were gripping and had a grown up quality to them that I loved. I have to say that after twenty years of reading her books, Diana is not a must race out and buy for me anymore as in the past. I gave Desperado a three star because I did feel that Diana did a good job bringing child slavery to the readers attention.	2002-07-12

I watched the movie version first when it came out in 1979 as an ABC Afterschool special and bought the book version a month ago.<br />Jessie Walters is a thirteen year old teenager who falls for her seventeen year old guitar instructor Michael Skye, who also plays and sings in his own band. Through the magic of makeup, Jessie is able to transform herself to look older and as she and Michael get to know each other, he asks how old she is and she blurts out that she is 16!<br />Michael asks her to one of his band practices and from there the two seem to click and fall for the other. Although Jessie hates deceiving Michael, she can't seem to stop herself because she is afraid of losing him. The moment of truth comes when she goes out on a date to the drive in with him. Will she, or won't she give in to the strong feelings Michael provokes in her?<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who would love to take a trip down memory lane and think about that first love you will never quite forget.

It was refreshing to see Prince Radovsky stay faithful to Lulu even after the two part ways.

(Abigail wants to share the information with her sister Caroline so she may educate her before marriage) This arrangement is a a \\"no strings attached\\" and James reluctantly agrees to help her. Neither party expects to feel the lust,desire and love that eventually consumes them. A jealous paramour of James is thrown in to shake up the lovers too. I thoroughly enjoyed this book even though I felt it was a bit far fetched that a lady such as Abigail would seek out a man for tutored sex, but hey that is what the fantasy is all about.	2002-07-06

I found the older brother James a little more redeemable than than Michael. After initiating Sarah into the art of sexual pleasure, Michael is forced to marry her out of duty because Sarah's brother has plotted to find her in a compromising postition and wishes to get her married because of gambling debts. Michael takes for the city after dumping Sarah in the country and leaves her behind for six months while he cavorts around with his ex mistress. Readers are to believe that these two did not have sex and was only companions to the other. This was too far fetched and I felt that Sarah should have dumped him promptly when she found this out and especially when she discovered that Pamela stayed at his home on occassion.(platonic according to Michael) I did not like how he ordered and verbally abused the women about in the book which only furthered my opinion that Sarah just needed to leave the cad and move on to greener pastures. <br />Although I did enjoy the start of the story and the ending was what should be expected, Michael did not come off as the romantic hero and was a disappointment. Love Lessons was a much better romantic read with a better hero and heroine.	2002-07-05

For once I enjoyed reading about a man who has principles, yet is overwhelmingly sexy and sensual. I found this book a bit more erotic than \\"suddenly you\\" and Lisa did not disappoint or skimp on the love scenes. <br />The story starts with Sophia applying for employment as Ross's assistant. (Ross is a highly thought of magistrate) She has a motive to do so because she thinks Ross jailed her brother and ultimately caused his \\"death\\". She wants to seduce him into falling in love with her then break his heart. At first she can't stand him or his touch but slowly finds out that Ross is not the fiend she once invisioned him as being. Ross is reluctant to hire Sophia because of the chemistry he feels with her, plus the fact that she is a woman. <br />As they settle into a routine, the sensual energy these two give off cannot be denied and they both fall for one another. There are other surprises as well but telling would give away the story. I highly recommend this book if you want to read a great sexy romance that keeps you captivated from beginning to end.	2002-06-20

After watching the movie Sooner or Later starring Rex Smith and Denise Miller, the sequel books are a bit disappointing, especially with the character of Michael Skye,(played by Rex Smith). I found the onscreen character and the book character different as night and day. Michael was portrayed as a shy,sexy somewhat lonely young man in the movie version which I found extremely appealing especially when he decided that he did want to make it work with Jessie despite the age difference. Rex Smith made Michael come alive but the book version does not do the character justice.<br />Now or Never is set three years after Waiting Games. Jessie is ready to graduate high school and is trying to get over losing Michael when he returns to Englewood under secretive circumstances which come out a little later in the book. Michael asks Jessie to forgive him for leaving her and also asks if they can be friends but Jessie is having a hard time coping due to her intense passion and love for him. It is too hard to \\"just be friends\\" when you love someone this much. <br />I did not feel that Michael really appreciated the love Jessie had for him and in my opinion, she was the only person who truly cared for him. The ending was too abrupt and left too many doors open on what happened to these two star crossed lovers. ALthough I enjoyed the trilogy of stories, Jessie and Michael are not finished. I would seriously recommend that the Harts finish this story and redeem Michael by portraying him as the good loving person he was in Sooner of Later.	2002-06-16

When I first purchased this book, I was expecting a little more insight into Jessie and Michael's relationship after they declared their love for one another in the sooner or later book. I felt that this book did not go into enough detail about the ups and downs of Michael and Jessies realtionship, nor did we really read enough about Michael's feelings at all. The big \\"love scene\\" was disappointing to say the least and from there Michael's transformation from a great guy to a waffling <BR>jerk took place. The Michael I love from the movie SOL is not in this book nor will you find him in the third installment, Now or Never.

Merry has always thought of herself as a plain drab woman until nic brings out her own special beauty and sensuality that scorches the pages of this terrific novel. <br />Merry is running from the pressures of an arranged marriage and devises a plot to pose nude for the notorious painter Nic Craven. This man is not afraid to express his sexual feelings or desires and blatantly sets out to seduce Merry into his bed and paint the best portrait he has ever done.<br />This book is loaded with alot of sexually charged erotic bedroom scenes and it may not be suitable for ever reader.

The biggest flaw I found in this particular book was the violence between the two main characters, Simon and Caroline. It appeared that every time these two came together, there was slapping and verbal abuse toward the other. This kind of turned me off from what little romance Ms. Johnson was trying to accomplish between the two. I can understand Caro's reluctance to get involved with Simon after his indiscretion five years earlier but when she did decide to &quot;bed&quot; him again, she turned wishy washy and verbally abuse toward him. There was too much bitterness and mistrust between the lead characters to really believe in any kind of romance or happily ever after for them. I hope Ms.Johnson's next book will give us the sensuality and romance that she is famous for.	2002-05-11

I was very reluctant to buy this book because the last few I had purchased were not very good. I read this book last night and I found myself interested and unable to put it down. I have always enjoyed reading about the Hart brothers and Rey did not disappoint me. At first he came off as arrogant and high handed but he has reasons to be so because of the past. It also appears that Ms. Palmer has finally created a heroine who is believable and although &quot;virginal&quot; is not some mis-informed female who knows nothing about the world. Meredith is a professional woman who is feisty and can stand her own against Rey. I almost feel that Diana has been reading some of the reviews others have posted about her books and really took a hard look at making some changes with her characters and plotlines because this book is far better than her last few.	2002-04-14

This is the first book I have ever read from this author and was very pleased with the story. In my opinion Katya was torn between her true love Nicholas, and the exciting general Alexi who teaches her not so much about sex, but the sensual aspects as well. I was surprised how the book ended, but could understand the choice Katya made. I would recommend this book to others who enjoy reading erotica romance.	2002-04-14

I am a big Diana Palmer fan but I am getting tired of reading about the same old dowdy dressing, \\"virginal\\" heroines who give timid a bad name. It is unbelievable to me that a woman (Callie)in her twenties could act as if she doesn't have a clue what sex is and in the next breath have feelings for a man who I felt bordered on the abusive end of the totem pole. Micah came off as an arrogant jerk which only made Callie look worse for the wear. I seen no romance or build up in this story at all and it took me a month to read it after putting it down many times in disgust. I hope her newer books hold more promise than the past few she has written.	2002-04-09

When I first picked up the book I was really excited. I felt for the heroine because she was in an abusive relationship and it was obvious that she wanted a better life for herself. As I read on, in steps darkly handsome Stephen, accusing her of poisoning his brother and wisks her off to his home to avenge his brother. What turns out to be a revenge plot turns into lust and want between the two characters and they declare their love. The gang rape and the hero \\"prostituting\\" himself in the name of love left me cold and disappointed because what could have been a grand romance turned out to be a pathetic, twisted mish mash that made the hero and heroine totally unbelievable. The ending would have been kleenex worthy had the middle of the book been presented better.	2002-04-04

I was hooked from the first page when Sam announced his interest in the lovely Alex Iodines and promptly set out to \\"woo\\" her into his bed and finally his heart. I have reread this book several times because I love the romance and erotic elements, plus there are no distractions of historical descriptions and events (wars etc..) to interfere with Alex and Sam's story. The sex scenes are right on target for Ms. Johnson and I would describe them as steamy and erotic that only she knows how to write.	2002-03-23
