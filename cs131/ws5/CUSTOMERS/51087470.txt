I've owned a copy for years and learned many tunes from it.  It includes the classic \\"A Glass of Beer\\", a very Irish sounding \\"Johnny Cope\\" and several great slow airs and marches.  But the person who compiled and arranged the tunes is Dave Rickard, not Susan MacQuaid.	2005-03-29

Even though it's a tome I read it very quickly and with great satisfaction.  The religiosity of Elizabethan politics were clearly as cynical as the politics of our own time, but in those days you could have your head removed for it.  That thought never left my mind as I plowed through this great read.  This is a serious book, but it reads like a novel.<br />Elizabeth is always held up as a master politician, and although Mary may or may not have been her equal politically she was her superior in charm by a long shot.  You cannot help sympathizing with her, admiring her courage, even if she might have been complicitous in her own victimization.  She was a very complex character, and this book does an excellent job of teasing out the various strands of her personality.<br />There is a lot of new information here as well.  If you have read the other books on the subject, especially Antonia Fraser's, or are looking for a good place to begin, this is the book for you.	2004-04-26

It is a much needed counter weight to the effervessence of other recent titles on temperament and harmonics.  It is such a beautifully visual book, with graphic depictions of sound waves, you will simply want to look at the illustrations for hours.  It hints at the mystical without falling off the edge into either New Age or Cultural Supremacy.	2004-04-26

A thankless job, no doubt.  Only a Polly Anna would expect anything but dogma from this writer, who is proud of her work as the Spin-mistress of the Bush team (listen to her NPR interview of March 31, 2004).  With so many Republicans fearing for the Republic and embarrassed by the lunatic fringe (Bill O'Rielly, Anne Coulter, Denis Miller, etc.), apparently there is no one outside the White House capable to do the job.  Or maybe there is no one outside the White House willing to do the job.<BR>Gosh, wouldn't be great if someone published a book that actually tried to find the middle ground?  Yes, Virginia, it would, but US politics is like Little League, where the parents threaten to beat the kids if they don't win the game, a fight could break out at the refreshment stand, and the Umpire hopes his tires are not slashed so he can make a quick escape after the game.  Ah, the great American past time.  Second only to NASCAR.	2004-03-31

The rest of the book is a must have for fluters and whistlers, and will also prove extremely helpful to Uilleann pipers.  There hasn't been as thorough an examination of how Irish music works, from any perspective.  He introduces a new, clear way of notating tunes that will become the standard.  As technical and scholarly as the content is, Larsen is never dry or academic.  The two CDs are an added bonus.	2004-03-09

Even if you don't know anything about the Carter family or old time music, or never saw OH BROTHER WHERE ART THOU this story will touch your heart.  It's as American as THE GRAPES OF WRATH and just as poetic.  In fact, reading it is a great antidote to all the commercial folderol of country music, and just about anything else.  When A.P. Carter was on his death bed all he would eat was a neighbor's home made apple butter.  This book is as much a comfort and a simple pleasure as that apple butter.  The same thing could be said of the Carter family music, I suppose.	2002-10-17

I love this book because it's all about the music.  It has enough ethnomusicoligy in it to assure you it's honest.  It has a wealth of wonderful tunes both in print and on a CD.  The CD gets the underlying rhythm across like notation just can't do.  And the stories about the old boys and girls are a bonus.  Too many old time fiddle books seem to be a catalogue of old boys.  You sometimes wonder if the author ever heard them play.  Not this book.  This is a university press publication, so if it sells out it probably won't be available again for a long time, if ever.  So get it now.	2002-10-17

Too much gushing and waxing poetical.  A dissappointing romantic and culturally biased performance.  If, however, you believe that all other music is inferior to Western musical culture because we have the tempered scale, and that Western music is the pinnacle of human accomplishment (and, yes, Martha, we can lump Wagner and Destiny's Child together for this one), you will find this book very comforting.	2002-05-01

There's plenty of intellectual pithe here, and inside stories about rock stars, as well as some slightly self absorbed gushing and gollying.  Overall a very satisfying read that will send you off in any number of very interesting directions.

This book reaches back to Joyce's Finnegan's Wake, with one foot on Isaac Beshivis Singer (spelling?) and the other on Steve Martin.  Yeah, it's a crazy kind of two step.  I'm not surprised some reviewers can't figure out where the beat is, but they don't need to fall all over themselves spleening the author.  I highly recommend this book to readers with a good ear and open mind.	2002-05-01

Just when he starts to make sense the author heads off on a tangent about the Catholic Church or some such bugaboo, and you loose confidence.  The mass of facts, calculations, esoteric formulas and mathematical problems made my head hurt.  But if you can get through all that and keep the basic message in mind, it is well worth reading from a musical point of view.  I don't know how a scientist would judge it.  The basic message is: everything connects.	2001-09-27

Thoughout my life I have run inconsistently, mostly as a chore to get in shape, preferring to bicycle when ever I wanted to engage long distance, aerobic efforts. Running always hurt too much in comparison to cycling. After reading this book my strengths, physical and mental, have come forward, and I run with a great deal more ease and enjoyment. But that's only half of it. Bern is a very high class story teller too. Very enjoyable book all the way around.	2001-08-24

Travis wants to write really, really, really well.  He succeeds, but in the same way Mahler succeeds as a composer, the way Jackson Pollack succeeds as a painter, loading each moment to point of bursting.  I forgave him the over-wrought quality of his writing because he is so earnest and tells such a great story.  It is also a book with a conscience and easily raises your consciousness.  Every mayor and transportation tzar of every major city in America would do well to read this book.  For them it would be work, but for bike geeks like me it's just more fun.	2001-03-26

MacLeod brings the mythic, the historical and contemporary experience together in a way that is magical, poetic and  yet unpretentious.  MacLeod is also a wonderful antidote to the American  writers who, I'm told, describe my experience.  MacLeod is not Joyce Carrol  Oates or E.L. Doctorow, thank God.	2000-04-06

Unfortunately, much of that knowledge  is less than accurate.  The second half of the book is much more  entertaining.  It is written General Richardson, who studied with John  MacDonald of Inverness.  Richardson has also passed on, sadly.  But he is a  great story teller, and even though he is not as technically minded as  MacNeil I found  his half of the book most useful because he manages to get  his love of the music across without puffing himself up in the process.	2000-01-06

MacLeod's writing is full of the &quot;blas&quot; (gaelic for &quot;taste&quot;) that is or was Cape Breton.  These stories are contemporary and ancient.  Though  they deal with modern issues and people, you can't help feeling these  stories are very old.  They reveal things unearthly and magical without  ever taking their feet off the ground or closing their eyes.  And there is  a sad sense of loss that everyone close to things old and beautiful must  feel in our modern culture.	2000-01-06
