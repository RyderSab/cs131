I loved how the stories of Sierra and Mary Katherine were seperate yet interwoven carefully together.  The plot is well-developed and follows Biblical guidelines.  I too was a little disappointed in the ending because it would be very hard to except a cheating husband back.<br />This is a must read!	2002-06-12

My oldest daughter had been raised &quot;on demand&quot; and it was a horrible experience for us.  By the time she was 4, I was still trying to get her to go to sleep at night without me in the room or without holding her hand for two hours until she fell asleep.  When our second daughter was born, she had her days and nights mixed up.  She would get up at 3 a.m. and want to stay awake until 10 or 11 in the morning.  She would wake up the whole house with her.  It was horrible!<br />When I first read some of this book, I thought it sounded horrible and abusive, too.  But out of desperation and lack of sleep I decided to LOOSELY follow the advice.  The first night was the worst and I sat outside the door and cried with her but she slept better then she did since we had brought her home.  By the third night she was falling right to sleep and only waking when she was hungry and going right back to sleep.<br />I do not think this book is abusive.  It is merely an idea or a plan to help parents who have babies who do not sleep well.  My youngest is now 3 and she is still the better sleeper of my girls!	2002-04-01

Tracie Peterson does a very good job of making the reader feel for the characters in the book. It is not a very long book so it was easy for me to read in just a few days. I gave it 4 stars because while it was done very well, it is not Tracie's best work.	2001-08-29

It was set in the 1900's in the city of L.A. and contained a little bit of everything; murder, courtroom drama, romance, and happy endings. I love Tracie Peterson and this book was just as good as many of her others. This is the first book by James Scott Bell that I have read, and now I want to read more. I can't wait to read the next book!	2001-08-29

While I agree with some of the other reviews that parts of it were unrealistic (like a 10 year old quoting word for word Scripture from the Bible that she has never read), I think it was still a very effective story. <br />I was thrilled with the suspense in the story and the surprise twists along the way.  I was deeply touched by Cadi's longing to have her sin removed and her determination to find the Sin Eater.  The imaginary friend Lilybet was a nice touch, though I didn't figure out she was imaginary for a few pages!<br />Just a marvelous piece of work with a message that will stand the test of time:  Jesus Christ is the only way to God and the only one who has the power to remove sins.<br />Profound.	2001-08-11

This is the first Tracie Peterson book I have read, and it was absolutely fabulous!!

You know a book is good when you feel so much a part of the storyline that you are actually experiencing right along with the characters.  That is what happened in this book!  I cried with them and felt like I was walking right beside them.<br />LaHaye and Blackstock paint such wonderful pictures of the neighborhood, and developed characters that are so realistic I wanted to be their friends.<br />I loved the message of God's grace, mercy, and blessings.

I thought that LaHaye and Blackstock would never be able to duplicate and certainly not be able to top the writing in the 1st book of this series.  How wrong I was!!  This book is even better than the first!   I can now relate even more to the characters of Cedar Circle, and I feel like they are my best friends.  I can hardly wait to turn each page so I can find out what happens next. I am anxiously awaiting the opportunity to read the 3rd book, because I know I won't be disappointed.	2001-08-04

The characters in this book were so vivid I felt I had met them in person.  I laughed a lot, I cried, and finished the book with joy in my heart.  Once again, Lori tells a page-turning, heartfelt story of God's love and how it is meant for all people.  This is one of those books that I didn't want to finish and want to read over again now that it is done!	2001-07-22

The biggest disappointment I had was with the dialogue.  Some of the conversations were simply unrealistic.  Even people who are Christians do not quote Scripture every time they open their mouths.  I think the story was very good, and teaches all who read it not to worry and to consider the lilies.	2001-07-16

Yes it had alot of the typical things that you expect to find in historical Christian romance novels.  But it also had a lot of new twists and a very different setting and plot.  I too, enjoyed the first person narration, it served to pull me into the story much more effectively. The only down side to the book was that the ending was a bit too predictable.<br />This is my favorite Janette Oke series just for the sheer difference in writing style and plot.	2001-06-11

The thing I liked most was that the characters were not flawless &quot;goody&quot; Christians, who never hide any skeletons in their closet.  Instead, the characters were vibrant, realistic, and believable.  I've known people like them.  I found myself in tears with sadness one minute and chuckling out loud the next.  Once I got past the allegorical style of writing this book was highly enjoyable.  This is a perfect snuggle up for a rainy day read.  The prevalent theme of God's healing power and forgiveness help the pages unfold a true life lesson anyone can use.  Once I finished the book, I found myself wanting to go to Java Jane's and have a latte.	2001-05-30

A few months ago when I finished Sophie's Heart I thought no other book by Lori Wick would ever be as good.  I was wrong.  Pretense was fabulous!  I was engrossed before page 100 which in a 700 page book that was not so bad.  The storyline is very involved, and the highlight of the book is the characters.  They were very realistic and so well developed that they were believable.  I cried twice in the book, and often found myself chuckling or laughing hysterically at Mackenzie's comments.  The message of salvation is woven beautifully throughout the book.  I'm glad the Wick made the girls wait a while to come to Christ.  It was good that she could illustrate through her story that there is no sin that God can not forgive, and that all people even Christians must struggle with temptations. After I read page 702, I just sat there staring at the page not wanting to read the last sentence because the book couldn't possibly be over already! Thank you Lori Wick for the best book I've read in a long time!	2001-05-26

The main character was out of her mind, you do not stay in an abusive relationship, Christian or not!  I thought her reactions to Tanner's abuse were unrealistic.  I would not want either of my girls to read this book for fear that they would think that the relationship between Stacy and Tanner was acceptable.  I thought the plot line wrapped up a bit too neatly in the end, the writing was creative enough to keep my attention.  Overall, poor story line and frustrating plot!	2001-05-03
US	45139899	R7AV1FXS48G0Y	0764225146	597290536	Dana's Valley	Books	5	13	13	N	N	A Tear-jerking page turner!	I thought this book was very realistic and thought-provoking.  It weaves an incredible story of faith, anger, love, death, and God's provision through the struggle of a young girl with lukemia.  There are several parts in the book where I was crying so hard I couldn't turn the page.  I think the authors did a great job of personalizing the story; and they made me feel like I was the one watching my sister die.  I don't agree with the reviews that it wrapped up to neatly in the end; I think the reactions of the family members were normal.  It would not be uncommon for someone to be angry at God for taking someone they love, and then realizing that God can use all situations for good.  While this book is very sad, there is an important lesson to be learned within its pages.	2001-04-29

While this book was very very good, it is not my favorite Lori Wick and therefore can't give it 5 stars.  About midway through this book the adventure and suspense really turn up and it becomes very hard to put down.  I must say while the ultimate ending was a little predictable, the rest of the plot has plenty of suspenseful moments and quite a few surprises.  Overall a tumultous, satisfying journey with Dallas, Smokey, and the ultimate captain- the Lord Jesus Christ.	2001-04-26

Lori Wick does a tremendous job of character development. This book somewhat models A Place Called Home in the plot line, but she does a much better job of suspense writing in this book.  This story has everything in it, suspense, romance, heartbreak, death, sadness, forgiveness, and is rich in cultural knowledge.  The beginning and ending were pageturners, the middle of the book moved a little slowly but was important for development of the story.  Overall, a very strong writing job by Lori Wick.	2001-04-21

My only disappointment was that it took several hundred pages for me to get really involved in the storyline.  I am glad that I stuck with it because it turned out to be very enjoyable.  This is the first book I have read by this author and she has sparked my interest enough that I will probably read the rest of this series.	2001-04-14

This book goes much farther beneath the surface than a lot of Lori Wick's other novels.  She does a tremendous job of tying the readers emotions into the storyline.  There was also elements of surprise, especially the ending which paves a very exciting road to the sequel. I was delighted with this book, as I usually am with Lori Wick.  I must say I would like for her to write more novels with as much depth as this one.	2001-04-04

There is so much license with fiction and Lori takes advantage of it in this novel.  I thought it realistically portrayed an arranged marraige and some of the problems and feelings that would come up in that situation.  I was glad to see that Shelby and Nick come to find each other and fall in love.  I would definitely recommend this book.	2001-04-03

I had several friends tell me it wasn't Lori Wick's best work.  I couldn't disagree more.  This book was wonderfully written and showed that Lori Wick is capable of writing incredible contemprary fiction.  I was pleased with the plot although predictable in a lot of places, it was still thrilling.  Each of the characters were fully developed and the book ended so well that I don't feel that there would need to be a sequel.<br />Well done Lori Wick!	2001-03-31

It was so good that I read the whole series in less than a week.  I now hold all of Lori Wick's books to the high standards that she set in this book and the other 3 in the Californians series.  I was in the story, falling in love with the Donovans, the Taylors, and Riggs.  It was wonderfully done and I will be forever grateful to my fried who let me borrow her copy because I am now a Lori Wick fan for life!	2001-03-29

I read this entire book in one Saturday afternoon.  I think it is a wonderful story of courage, determination to follow God's will, and unselfishness.  Although I disagree with the book's philosphy that women are only pastors because men don't answer their calling, I think it is an inspiration to all women to follow God's calling and leading in their life- no matter what it brings.	2001-03-29

After being disappointed with Song for Silas, and the Long Road Home it was very refreshing to read such a well put together story.

Never have wanted to meet characters like I've wanted to meet Bobbie and Jeff Taylor.  Lori Wick does a phenomenal job with the storyline.
