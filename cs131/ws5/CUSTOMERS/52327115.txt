There was a beginning, which logically proceeded to the middle, which logically led to the conclusion.  Neat and simple.  Mr. Demille has written a book which takes care of two of the three elements.  His begginning was great, and held my attention.  His middle was perhaps even better, leading me to stay up later to get to the end.  The ending is a bummer and left me cold.  A surprise ending is only for someone who cannot make up their own mind about where their work would lead them.	2004-12-12

I truly enjoyed his early books about modern combat.  His ventures back to the civil war left me bored, even when he was writing about the Irish.   &quot;God's Children&quot; brings him back to this era,and the plight of  the military in a no win political situation.  The plight of a young second  lietentant reminded me of my plight as a young ensign. I must of had better  teachers, because I was smart enough to seek advice from the leading chief.  I am glad that Coyle has returned to the modern military, as frustrating as  it is for peacetime warriors.	2000-02-20

I think I have read them all.  I keep waiting for Ed MCBain to go stale, his plots become disorganized and the suspense  to ebb. Well 40 plus years of reading and I have yet to be disappointed.   &quot;The Last Dance&quot; has all the same characters, but I found the  plot to be more intriguing and the suspense lasted until the end. Mr  McBain's description of the City on page 91 is alone worth the price of the  book.  Ed McBain keep on writing, you keep me young.	2000-01-11

I took a chance and I was glad I did.  The characterizations reminded me of  the Richard Stark books about the Outfit.  Not the best of all people, but  they make for interesting reading.  I hope Mr. Connelly goes back to Harry  Bosch, but Cassie Black and the other low lifes in &quot;Void Moon&quot;  make for a very good suspensful story.	1999-12-24

Too many authors have not learned their craft, Messers Douglas and Block have.  The story builds  from the beginning, as the characters are developing the  inter-relationships. The suspense is heightened during the middle phases,  as the reader is teased with alternatives twists and turns of the plot, and  the successful end culiminates the story.  This is a very good book.	1999-12-10

The plot was well structured, the characters believeable, the settings well defined.  However, the author spent too much of the middle of the book developing  background which was not necessary, and quite frankly boring.  As a  Catholic I did not care abount Rose going to her old family priest, nor was  I interested in what her family did in the summer.  Take the equivalent of  about 75 selected pages out of the middle and you have a 5 star book.	1999-12-06

Every so often one of my favorite authors decides to seek another venue, and forsakes the old favorites.  Harold Coyle did it with the Civil War and Dale Brown did it with Tin Man. Mr. Coyle made the mistake of continuing  with his sojourn. Thank God Dale Brown returned to the venue which serves  his readers best.  This is an exciting military aviation thriller and I  hope Dale Brown writes many more of these type novels.	1999-11-24

It seems many writers struggle earlym reach a plain of success and then go into decline. Apparently this has happened to Michael Crichton.  The book is entertaining, but the plot rambles without control. I do not regret buyg  the book, but I was generally disappointed. I  would give this book 1 &amp;  1/2 stars it was an option.	1999-11-24

I needed time to digest the story.  This is a well written book,  with a lot of thought provoking aspects.  It is a fine story by an  exceptional author.	1999-10-02

This is one of the most enjoyable.  From the days of nearly being court martialed in Nam, to Rear Admiral.  Jake Grafton has  progressed.  So too has Stephen Coonts.  This is a well written, carefully  crafted novel; his characters are believable and the plot builds to the  appropriate crescendo.  My only regret is that I see an end to the jake  Grafton books, he will now be too removed from any action.	1999-08-22

At the end of twenty pages I was utterly convinced that the Sander's estate had made a terrible choice to ghost  write this series.  By the end of the book Mr. Lardo had gotten better.  He  had quit trying to be too cute and began to concetrate on the story.  There  are several twists and turns in the plot, and I must say that I enjoyed the  book.  If the series continues I would buy the next episode. I think this  book rates 31/2 stars, but not 4 stars.	1999-07-15

Perhaps over 20 years with the DA's office has something to do with it, or is it two sons who are officers with major police agencies.   To the best of my knowledge this is the first  Robert Crais novel that I have read; how could I have missed the earlier  ones?  Michael Connelly and Harry Bosch are probably my favorite  combination but Robert Crais and the pair of Pike and Cole will have a  place in my collection.  Mr. Crais plot is well developed, it moves rapidly  and comes to a fitting conclusion.  I look forward to reading his next  novel.	1999-06-23

Perhpas I should not venure too far from my cops and heroes books, but &quot;The Visitation&quot; seemed a challenge.  I did not take me too long to guess the eventual outcome.  I was glad to see that this author did not  attempt to stage religious wars, or make this a theological treatise.  Travis Jordan is an enjoyable character, but 519 pages could easily have  been condensed to about 300, and which would have necessarily tightened the  plot.	1999-06-21

Many years ago I read my first Leon Uris Novel, &quot;Battle Cry&quot;,I liked it.  Since then his books have been spotty.   This is trash! Irish cop turned rancher, good priest, bad busniness man  and mysterious parentage haunting the presidential candidate.  It would not  even make a good soap opera.	1999-06-15

All that aside I can only state that this book was a disappointment.  Mr.  Harris started off well, and the plot moved rapidly for the first third of  the book, after that it detiorated rapidly, culminating in the finale, the  inane ending.  Awful! Even with a substantial discount this book is not  worth buying.	1999-06-13

General Horner may have been brillant as a fighter  pilot and a commander, but his biography is pretty boring.  I say this an  old &quot;brown shoe&quot; navy man who flew in the same era as when Horner  was a young lieutenant.  I can not comprehend how any one with little or no  military training could even pick this tome up.  Too long, too technical  and a little too self agrondizing.	1999-06-07

If I hadn't read the book jacket I would have thought that John Connolly was a native of Maine, New York or  Louisiana; he must be a fine researcher.  Bird Parker is believable as a  troubled ex-NY detective,  the characters of Angel, Louis, Detective  Morphy, Rachel and the others add substance to the plot and the continuity  of the story.  The intricate descriptions both add, and to some degree,  detract from the book; it is a tad too long.  This is a heck of a first  novel and I am quite curious about what his next novel might be.	1999-06-05

It would be much worse for Glenn Meade if I compared it to The Day of the Jackal. The characters in this novel lack substance, the plot is  trite but it is an a entertaining novel.  If this you want spend several  hours with light reading this is not too bad of a choice.	1999-05-31

We have the US Navy ready and waiting, the political sharks in the  water, the treacherous George Wahington kidnapping and terroriaing and the  good guys represented by Jim Dillon and friends.  Once again Jim has  researched the constitution to help out our country in need and is prepared  for his first two major legal trials, as a defence attorney on one hand and  later as a prosecutor.  Okay some is a little unbelieveable, but it is okay  in fiction.  I don't see how James Huston can come up with another sequel,  but if he does I will buy it.	1999-05-26

I have been reading several novels a week since my days as an English major in the mid 50's.  In those days I read Graham Greene, and Evelyn Waugh in class, and Alaistar MacLean in the Saturday Evening Post.  I have  always emjoyed the cratsmanship of MacLean, and Jack Higgins is the closest  contemporary writer to him. &quot;The White House Connection&quot; is the  latest Higgins' novel that I have read, and Sean Dillon and crew are there  to liven up the action. There is a fast moving plot, wonderful  characterters, both good and evil.  Too bad Lady Helen will not be  available for later stories. Perhaps there might be room for Hedley as part  of the Brigadier's staff in future stories? He would add a little variety  to the team. Old friends are the best and I truly enjoyed another fine Jack  Higgins novel.  When is his next novel due to be published?	1999-05-16

I did not realize that Mr. Coonts was old enough to know of MacLean, but I am.  Andy McNab  may not be the best since MacLean, but he is assuredly a fine writer.  He  has developed a close knit plot, cleverly inserting various possible clues  and factions (PIRA, DEA, CIA, SIS, et al) into his storytelling.  As a  craftsman he has maintained continuity while providing the beginning,  middle and end of the story, never leaving the reader in a lurch.   &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; may have been better, but I read that  about 40 years ago.  I look forward to &quot;Crisis Four&quot;.	1999-05-15

General MacAthur has always been an enigma to me; this book did nothing to solve the enigma. Was the general an evil egoist, or a genius?  Was he manipulating the Japanese, or being manipulated by them? Could the general  be so easily conned by Colonel Genius and Captain Marsh?  The plot was  there, the telling was not.  The ending was infantile.  Maybe it is really  closer to 1 star.	1999-05-10

He has written a good story, easy to follow with plenty of suspense. In my opinion  he is not yet the equal of Tom Clancy nor even Michael Silva, but he is  good.  I think Silva is better than Clancy. I picked the book up this  morning and read it throughout the day.  It kept my interest. The ending  was superb.	1999-04-15

My problem is there are far too many subplots, prostitutes from Russia, Japanese Yakaze,  Mr. Pink Eyes, British Intelligence, Strawman, the Mossad, the Rat Line and  the hit and run attack on his daughter.  It was written for careful  reading, do not try to speed read as I usually do. Although complicated I  enjoyed the story and took the time to read it carefully.

Basic problem number 1 is that police officers are fingerprinted, and the prints are generally submitted to the Feds.  An  ex-military man's fingerprints would show up in the Fed's data bank.  His  hero could not have gone from department to department using a fake name.   I really wonder if a CID Captain/Colonel would tell a son of his father's  &quot;fragging&quot;, and identify the perps?  I doubt it.  If you can get  past the improbables the story is interesting.	1999-04-03

I admired Oliver but got lost in the  world of the magician, the spy, the merchant, the lawyer, his dear dad  Tiger, the russian mafia and the various love interests.

In the past 4 weeks I have read several books; novels, non-fiction and some that are somewhere in between.  However, &quot;The Marching Season&quot; makes them all pall. Mr Silva now ranks with Clive Cussler,  Jack Higgins, W.E.B. Griffin, Michael Connelly, and outshines Tom Clancy in  my list of favorite authors.  The book is extermely fast paced and  readable.

This is not  the first Elmore Leonard book that I have bought and read, but it will be  the last! As someone who reads a lot of books and as a matter of principle,  finishes every book that I start, this book was a cahllenge to my  principles.	1999-03-18
