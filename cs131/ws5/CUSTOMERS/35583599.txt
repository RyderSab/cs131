But we learn Tippy has been kidnapped, lost Cash's baby, and had her face slashed. When?<br />It is good to hear what happened to the others in Jacobsville, but not the new characters introduced at random is boring.<br />I loved the story of Libby and Jordan, but Libby's brother Curt seems cardboard like.<br />Libby is so smart, but she needs Jordan to help her put 2+2 together.<br />Curt just goes by what ever Jordan and Mr Kemp say without thinking himself. Never once did he go and have it out with Jordan because of the way Jordan was treating his sister.<br />Jordan is smart, but he is blind and dumb.

Reading it from Ellis Galbrath's point of view, I understand that he wanted to be able to offer Sorrel Maitland a better future than the one he had at the moment, but to get rid of her he uses cruel methods to get his point across. Years pass and now he is successful he wants Sorrel and she has tried to change herself to be like the women she has seen Ellis with.<br />Sorrel had a breakdown behind their split, and now Ellis wants to waltz back into her life as though everything is ok now.<br />But he starts by tring to bring back the sweet girl he rejected, when she was 17.<br />Sorrel has inherited money from old Mr Ollerenshaw as she was a companion to him in his last years on earth, and though it is a drop in the bucket to the money his daughter got Cynthia Armaitage wanted every penny her father had even though she wasn't a good daughter, to him she never spent a second with him, she turns into a witch er remove the 'w' and put a 'b' in it's place.<br />Ellis thinks Sorrel is getting her money from a suger daddy, but we don't learn until later why it means so much to Ellis that Sorrel is the same girl he was so mean to.<br />I wish Sorrel had made him grovel more but the book was a good read.<br />For more good reads see SUSAN FOX, Helen Brooks, and Rebecca Winters.	2004-02-08
