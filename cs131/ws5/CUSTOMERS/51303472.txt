There aren't many books that can make me laugh and cry at the same time. Excellent.<BR>I'll start with Clint even though he's not the main character. He should have been. Nappily Ever After shows the pain and frustration of a young black man just trying to make a way for himself. He never signed on to be the dream man of Venus jor Kandi for that matter. He wanted to be a doctor. The job of husband, and dream keeper he didn't sign on for. I loved the truth of the story. Sometimes truth is crazier than fiction. Tisha Thomas tells the truth and dazzles it with a little fiction. Venus and Kandi both had their own agendas, neither cared too much about how Clint felt in the long run.<br />Giving this book five stars isn't enough. I wish there were other options. Recommended highly for grown folks as well as young. Ten stars!!	2003-04-09

This book was written to appeal to the gritty, but the gritty don't do much reading. I would suggest the next Angela Bivens story clean up a bit. There are way too many stereo typical manerisms for black people in this story. Cursing and slang are just to name a few. Now for the actual story. Predictable. Absolutely predictable. Yes, the brother did it. Who would have guessed? ME&gt; The style of writing was fast and I didn't mind the skipping to one scene to the next. Most writers do that when they think it will be a better movie than a book. But it's not a movie. It's a book. An will probably remain that way.	2002-01-16

The deeper side of the story is the love between mother and child, or in this case, uncle and niece. The question of whether a child belongs with a blood related family member simply because they share DNA, or should that child go where he is truly loved? Mitchard did an excellent job presenting both sides of the arguement. Nothing like a battle well fought and even more rewarding was how the battle was won. I loved Deep End of the Ocean, and was luke warm on the ones in between. Theory of Relativity is handsdown the best work of J. Mitchard.	2001-07-29

The child loses all dignity and fight becoming a whipping boy for his foster mother and the babysitting neighbor who molests him. After surviving a frightening and abusive childhood, Fish tells his story as an adult where he joins the military and takes on the demons hiding in his closet. His story is strong and brings light to an ever depressing subject, what do we do with the unwanted children. When I finished this book, I wanted to know...how can I help. Someone's got to. This book made it evident that something has to be done. Finding Fish is a touching story that ends with triumph...but his story is a unique one.	2001-07-04

I ususally don't read books like this, however I couldn't put this book down!  The imagery that Trisha created was like nothing else that I have ever read. Since reading this book I tried to find other authors (Essence Best Seller List) that might be as talented without any luck.  <br />These people crying because Venus didn't marry Clint need to get over their own sad lives.  Venus evolved emotionally and spiritually and came to the understanding that her relationship with Clint was not healthy.  Why go into a marriage just because two people had  &quot;all of those years&quot; together if it's not mutually loving?  Kandi hooking up with Clint is how it happens sometimes.  Because of failed relationships, they both knew exactly what they wanted the next go round.<br />This is a happy story.  If people read this book thinking its like the other mind numbing books on the market they may not be satisfied.  However, if you are looking for a thought provoking and spiritually enlightening novel, Nappily Ever After is the only one to read!	2001-04-19

Butterfly Sunday tells the story of Leona, a young woman who marries Averil Sayers after she is jilted with child by a boyfriend who rather marry money. The baby she gives birth too is dead, that's what she's been told by her righteous husband. When she finds out that the baby wasn't stillborn but died at the hands of her husband, she begins the task of her redemption. She plans to kill Averil slowly with rat poisoning, first in dinner, then in the chocolate cake. The task is not easy, she is a good girl after all. Killing someone is not what she is bred to do. The irony of the entire story is that she is a &quot;good girl&quot; and in the end she is vindicated. A love story, a suspense, and a murder mystery all in one. Great storytelling!! 10 STARS	2001-03-23

Just a reason to smile. I loved the lightheartedness of this book. What a wonderful change and breath of fresh air. Jenny Brown is tired of her banking job, tired of her husband ignoring her and even though she doesn't directly go out and look for a change in life, (actually, she falls into it), it's still obvious she was open to it, which is exactly the way change happens.

The story is told through the eyes of Norma a professional photographer who has committed the worse possible crime as far as her best friend Moxie is concerned. Moxie has her own set of woes as a Probation officer and single mother of Zadie, a spirited smart teenager who challenges all that her mother has taught her in one fell swoop by dating the wrong type of boy and straightening her beautiful natural hair just to be accepted.

The rest was brilliant, most loved Junot Diaz, the Sun, the Moon, the Stars. The fiction, poetry, and essays in Step Into A World were intense, thought provoking, and at times humorous reads. Then I'd find myself turning back to Kevin Powell's introduction wondering why he was so angry. He'd accomplished his goal of putting together an anthology that would go against the grain of the mass marketed African American literature that has dominated the book shelves. I'm happy for him, so why couldn't Kevin be happy too. Two words, &quot;Anger Management&quot;, get some. No one wants to hear all of the &quot;fight the power&quot; rhetoric in the year 2000. Peace out, and keep hope alive.	2000-12-16

Far From The Tree is the second African American book that I've read and it seems that all the characters do is critique and bad mouth each other.

The painful and constant violation of females scared me. How could it be that Chinese female children suffered the abuse of having their feet broken and folded so that they would have even smaller feet. May suffered the excrusiating pain with promise of reward, a husband who would love her. Instead the pain and violence only contintued as the fourth wife of her older abusive husband, she was constantly raped, sodomized and beaten. There was no reward. That seems to be the theme of this book. Suffering only leads to more, light seemingly put out at the end of this tunnel. A sad quiet story that still haunts me.	2000-10-06

A sub-character with very very very little to add in the big scheme of things has got me perplexed.  Did he die of AIDS? Did he slip in a pool and drown. I just didn't get it.  <br />With that aside. Rescue Me was an intense ride in romance and the heedy  side of drugs, premarital sex, and kids(pretending to be adults) acting  like piranha while their mom is away living la vida loca with the car  salesman. And then there's Gabriel, the black angel, who waits ten years  for Amanda who dumps him like a rotten sack of potatoes for James(Jimmy)who  can give her everything she's always dreamed of, a life outside of her run  down drug shack. When Amanda realizes that her big house and soccer mom  status isn't enough she searches for Gabriel to come back into her life.
