Lynn Harris so I thought that by reading James Earl Hardy, I would be able to add him to my list.  But this is only the first book and it wasn't bad at all.  I thought Mitch and Raheim's story is unique in the sense that even though they are a gay couple, you can relate to them and put yourself in Mitch's shoes and think from a woman's perspective.	2005-09-01

The other reason why I didn't enjoy this book, there were too many typos.

I have heard of him, but I never read any of his books.  I just wasn't interested.  I ended up reading two of his books, and became an instant fan.  When he came out with this book \\"What becomes... \\", I really didn't want to read it.  I wanted to borrow it from someone and read it, which is rare, cause I love collecting novels.  But, the bookclub that I joined (Blackexpressions.com) sent me this book (I didn't order it at all).  I was about to send it back to them, when something told me to just go ahead and read it.  I couldn't put the book down, there were things about E. Lynn Harris, that touched me.  Because in many ways we have lots in common.  I'm not gay or anything, but what he's gone through when it came to looking for love and self esteem and everything else in between, I saw myself.  I ended up emailing E. Lynn Harris about this book, and hopefully he'll read my email and email me back.  But please, please, please go out and get this book.  It is so inspirational, whether you are gay or straight.  Make sure you have a box of tissues with you.	2003-09-10

He's my favorite author now. I can't wait for his next book, whenever that will be. But if anyone out there who is  unsure about reading his books. Take it from me he's good, he's worth  paying the money for. Eric if you are reading this, Please Please Please  keep up the good work. You are an excellent writer.	2000-08-01

No other male singer can compare. I mean I love other artists but Michael is just a genius. Now I haven't read this book yet but all I know is that anything that is put out about Michael  (Positive of course) or about any other Jackson family member for that  matter is going to be excellent.	1999-12-21
