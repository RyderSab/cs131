US	52823511	R3SBTPCWV44554	0446363669	666253702	The Doomsday Conspiracy	Books	1	4	8	N	N	What a silly little book.	I can't believe this book was a best seller. Even more, I can't believe I read the whole thing. Here's my nitpicking beef with the premise: this secret cabal is intent in permanently silencing the witnesses to the downed \\"weather balloon\\" in an attempt to keep the world from knowing we are not alone and breaking out in global panic. The span of time in the book is about a month. Yet in that time there is no panic, there is no exclusive interview with Diane Sawyer, there's nothing! There's nothing because the witnesses aren't saying anything. A few thought the whole crash was a hoax, another few were too embarrassed to say anything for fear of being ridiculed, and the one or two who did tell someone else what they saw weren't believed. There was really no reason for this Organization to go to all the trouble and expense to kill the witnesses off.	2005-05-17

For myself, I really, really enjoyed this book. There's not a slow spot in the entire 700 plus pages. It's non-stop action, adventure, mystery, intrigue, outlaws and inquisitors, captures and escapes, myths and legends, love and sex. I'm anxious now to read his other books.	2004-08-29
US	52823511	R35T5JXGKJ771I	1404363319	279841233	Call of the Canyon, The	Books	2	8	11	N	N	An interesting view of life from the early 20th Century	This is my first Zane Grey book I've ever read. I was expecting an old-fashioned Western with cowboys, six shooters, \\"purty\\" school marms and villians in black hats. This book isn't about that at all.<br /><br />What it is is part condemnation of America's shoddy treatment of its returning soldiers after World War I, and part condemnation of the modern women of the times.<br /><br />Zane Grey, using the voices of his fictional characters, rants against \\"modern feminine unrest\\" (AKA feminism), the immoral dress of the flapper (Heavens, her ankles are showing!) and says the women are, and I quote, \\"idle, luxrious, selfish, pleasure-craving, lazy, useless, work-and-children shirking, absolutely no good.\\"<br /><br />In one memorable scene, Grey has his heroine Carly preaching about the evils of such things as motion pictures, automobiles, jazz, birth control and plucking eyebrows. Oddly, Grey seems to be obsessed with a low birth rate in the nation and refers several times in the book to the fact that women aren't having babies like they should. It makes me curious as to what exactly was going on in the early 1920's.<br /><br />  So while this book wasn't what I was expecting it to be, it turned out to be an interesting take on what post-World War I America appeared to be to one man.	2004-08-20
US	52823511	RWYF46SK5U65	0679428895	451458080	Pompeii: A Novel	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Highly recommended	The book is short, concise, fast paced and, as we all know, has a heck of a climax. The characters are worth caring about. I seem to find what I like most about the story is the different angle it takes when it comes to a central character. Almost all historical fiction books set during the Roman era either pertain to the upper crust of emperors, generals and senators, or the lowest of the low slaves and gladiators. Here the hero is a good old-fashioned working stiff, someone I could identify with.	2004-06-05

There's relentless action but after awhile it gets monotonous. The enemy attacks and burns everything, the colonists rebuild as best they can, the enemy comes back and burns everything. In between the menfolk march off for a couple of campaigns. Monotonous though the book is, I suppose this was how life really was back then.<br />But no matter how much action the book contains, it's hard to enjoy it when you absolutely hate the characters. I'm speaking specifically of the &quot;hero&quot; Gil Martin. I hated him with a passion and kept hoping that he would meet a gruesome end. If I had been his wife Lana I would have killed him long before now.<br />Bearing in mind the novel was written in the 1930's, don't expect any political correctness. The minorities are written in all their stereotypical splendor (&quot;How!&quot; &quot;Yass'um mas'a&quot;) and the women are treated almost as poorly. Once in awhile a character would pop up that I found I could like but they only lasted a couple of pages. Overall I couldn't warm up to this book because of the annoying characters although I was able to develop a respect for the real life colonists and what it must have really been like for them just trying to survive season by season.	2004-06-01

Interesting mixture of sword-wielding, honor-bound samurais and gun-toting, code of the American West cowboys. The first of the book is low on action as everyone's story (and believe me everyone in this book has a story) is established. Then the action kicks into gear and the rest of the book is nothing but blood, blood, blood! Beheadings, dismemberments, evisceration, patricide, infanticide, and (lest we forget the cowboys) gunshot wounds. Buckets and buckets of blood in all its gory details. Once the story gets going it keeps a good pace and it did hold my interest all the way through.	2004-04-30

I enjoyed the book but have a warning for other soft, city-bred (like me) potential readers.

But I'm delighted with the book. It's slightly larger than the usual journals. Although it doesn't double back on itself like spiral-bound books, the hand-stitching does allow you to open it up wider than regular hardbacks, so you don't have to crimp your handwriting as you near the crease.	2003-02-09

I put the blame on the characters inhabiting the novel.  Not one was worth worrying over, and if you don't care about a character,  you don't care what's happening to the character. All were unsympathtic, if  not downright abbrasive or cold. Also, I guess I've got too much Puritanism  in me, but all the incest going on put me off as well. True, the Egyptians  of this time saw nothing wrong with it, but I did.	2000-08-16

Riding in the car with nothing but miles of empty road ahead of you? This book will help pass the time away. A good light read. It doesn't delve too deep into historical  fact to making you think, and Ms. Bradshaw still hasn't quite gotten the  knack of writing a decent love story, but the book does move at a good pace  and keeps you interested to the end.	2000-07-21

Rather annoying. Olivia is so caught up in her own troubles, she basically is ignorant of what's going on  in her childrens' lives, which turns me against her character. Amos is just  there. He doesn't play much of a part in the book. This is Maya's story,  and she's not much of a heroine to root for. Plot twists were obvious and  seen coming a mile away. I'll give credit, though, to Ryman having the guts  to kill a major character.	1999-12-27
US	52823511	RFWHHDELJVWRU	0061053104	387426853	The Terminal Experiment	Books	3	4	6	N	N	Not hardcore science fiction	Surprisingly, this book concentrates more on the emotional and philosophical conflicts of the characters. The &quot;sci-fi&quot; part of it is merely background, with some of the technology very possible in the  near future. The first part of the book tells of super-engineer Peter G.  Hobson (you never find out what the G stands for) and how he deals with a  personal crisis. He's not trying to save the world from aliens or  technology run rampant. He's merely induring what many people also have to  deal with today and in years past. The second half of the book then turns  into a murder mystery. The ending was rather anti-climatic and too clean  cut, but the story was well paced and kept me occupied, although I have to  agree with another review saying the characters were a tad wooden.	1999-12-13

They were too busy snapping and gripping with each other and other people for me  to care about them. For a better time-travel/romance, I highly recommend  the Diana Gabaldon series. For an Ancient Egypt story, brave the bulk of  Margaret George's 'Memoirs of Cleopatra'.	1999-11-29

It has to be pretty bad for me to drop it, and this book achieved this level. I didn't care anything about the characters, I didn't care anything about what was  going on (when I could figure out just what was going on), and the writing  was stilted. Boring, at times predictable, and uninvolving.	1999-09-05

But, most of the characters are acceptable, except for the case of one woman who was terribly annoying. And yet, when she's taken hostage by a murderer, no one seems to be all that concerned about it, not even her family. They're more interested in finding some money. When next she's seen again, no one bothers to ask her if she's all right or anything. Apparently no one in the book cared all that much about her, either.	1998-07-11

This is the first Edward Rutherford I've ever read, and now that I've been introduced to him, I plan on reading his other works as well.

Instead, I prefer to read Bundori and Shinju simply for the well written descriptions of 17th century Japan, and in my mind compare their civilization to what was happening at the same time in Western civilization. Laura Joh Rowland writes cleanly and briskly, with good pacing and plenty of action. I like the character of Sano and care about what happens to him, as well as some of the secondary characters. On the flip side, there were some moments in the story that were typically predictable. But once you get past that, it's still an easy read.	1998-03-27
