In 1921,in his A Treatise on Probability(TP),J M Keynes pointed out that the purely mathematical conception of probability was a very small subset of what he called the logical theory of probability.In order to apply the purely mathematical laws of probability correctly,a decision maker had to have a complete sample space of all possible outcomes specified in advance.An equivalent assumption is that the decision maker knows for certain what the particular probability distribution is.Secondly,probability preferences would have to be specified by a complete order that was linear or proportional.Any decision situation that did not satisfy these conditions had a weight of evidence less than one.Keynes specified a variable,w,called the weight of the evidence,that measured the completeness of the relevant,potential evidence that was available to the decision maker.It was defined on the unit interval between 0 and 1,just like Ellsberg's rho variable that would serve as a measure of the ambiguity of the evidence.The existence of ambiguity automaticaly will lead to violations of the purely mathematical laws of probability.Contrary to Kahneman and Tversky,Ellsberg,like Keynes before him,argued that these calculations are not erroneous and the decision makers are not irrational or biased.The claims made by Tversky, Kahneman and their many followers(Shiller,for example),that the subjects in their experiments are probabilistically and statistically illiterate,makes no sense because the problems that are presented to the experimental subjects do not allow the subjects to unambiguously define a unique probability distribution or a complete sample space of all possible outcomes(some  examples are the blue-green taxi cab problem,the rare Asian disease problem,the battlefield problem,the Linda-bankteller problem,and the lawyer-engineer problem).Let us now turn to the representativeness heuristic.The representativeness heuristic turns out to be none other than Keynes's degree of similarity or likeness or resemblance discussed by Keynes in chapter 3 and Part III of the TP.The anchoring and availability heuristics are identical to the statement that the weight of the evidence is less than 1 for a real world decision maker.Keynes showed that decision makers would usually be able to use interval estimates(upper-lower probabilities) only.You automatically will violate the mathematical laws of probability,which only hold in the limiting case where w=1,given linear probability preferences.Keynes also showed this in his examples of his conventional coefficient of weight and risk,c.The answers obtained when one applies the c coefficient will be sub and super additive.Keynes ,however,would argue that these are not biases or errors,but correct calculations obtained with incomplete information.The vast majority of decision makers are attempting to reason probabilistically without the benefit of knowing a unique probability distribution,a complete sample space,or being able to specify a complete order over all outcomes.They are rational.Tversky and Kahneman are requiring \\"SUPERRATIONALITY\\".Every calculation of a probability estimate that does not have a weight of 1 or violates Carnap's rule of total evidence will violate the mathematical laws of probability.L J Cohen,repeating Keynes's argument,spent 20 years trying to get this point across to Kahneman and Tversky in  the journal Brain and Behavioral Science(1975-1994) .Tversky's support theory is a belated attempt to remedy their omission,but it has not been successfuly integrated into Prospect theory(1979)or Cumulative Prospect theory(1992),where the weighting function is still  a function of a single variable representing probability,although additional parameters have been incorporated into the model.One could argue that it is Tversky and Kahneman who are irrationally insisting that decision makers use the mathematical laws of probability

It is based on an argument from ignorance:Robinson and Kahn were the major figures in\\"...the intimate little group around Keynes at Cambridge who'd helped him refine the GT and they felt that they best understood what Keynes had intended\\"(Parker,pp.437-438;also see p.92-93,97).Therefore,they must have understood \\"What Keynes Meant\\" better than anyone else.The fact is that neither R Kahn nor J Robinson had anything to do with the writing,or the refining, of the GT.Like Gardiner Means and Galbraith,Kahn and Robinson ascribed involuntary unemployment and underemployment to imperfect competition(monopoly,monopsony,oligopoly,oligopsony,imperfect competition,monopsonistic competition,etc.).Parker(pp.112-13)covers the famous trip made by Gardiner Means to England to meet with Keynes.Means fully expected Keynes to tell him that the GT's major conclusions were based on the assumption of \\"administered prices\\".(The imperfect competition of Kalecki, Kahn ,and Robinson).Keynes told Means very clearly that the foundations of the GT had nothing to do with the assumption of inflexible wages and/or prices.This should have been the end of the line for the canards of Robinson and Kahn.It was not.Kahn and Robinson had convinced a whole group of economists that Keynes did not have the mathematical and analytic tools needed to provide a formal mathematical  model of his theory of effective demand in the GT.Keynes,it was claimed,was a strictly literary economist who based all his theoretical results on intuition alone.Kahn and Robinson claimed that Keynes had no grasp of the  microeconomic technicalities of Marshallian theory(microeconomic theory).Kahn claimed that Keynes was a poor mathematician by 1927.Both Kahn and Robinson claimed that Keynes had never taken the twenty minutes necessary to understand and apply,in a formal manner, value(price) theory(see Parker,pp.97-98).Kahn and Robinson were able to convince the world's top economists that Keynes had made all types of mathematical and logical errors in the GT despite their efforts to correct these errors.Supposedly,Keynes had failed ,in his chapter 3,to provide correct supply side analysis.Galbraith,like Solow,Samuelson,Klein,Modigliani,Patinkin,Clower,Leijonhufvud,Weintraub,Davidson,and many,many other world class economists,swallowed it all down.The\\"What did Keynes Mean?\\"industry was born.This misbelief of Galbraith's shows up with devastating force in the showdown between Solow and Galbraith over Galbraith's book The New Industrial State.Parker correctly shows that Galbraith had no formal mathematical model on which to base his conclusions and policy advice.Solow clearly showed that Galbraith's conclusions were based on nothing more than his moral and ethical outrage against the existence of poverty and involuntary unemployment-underemployment.Galbraith could have found the model he so desperately needed in chapters 19,20,and 21 of the GT.Unfortunately,he had long ago accepted the many lies and distortions of Kahn and Robinson.What Galbraith needed and never was able to attain is the following result from the GT:w/p=mpl/(mpc+mpi),where mpl is the marginal product of labor derived from a neoclassical aggregate production function(contrary to Parker,pp.304-305),w/p is the real wage,mpc is the marginal propensity to spend on consumption goods,and mpi is the marginal propensity to spend on investment goods.Only in the case where mpc+mpi=1 can the classical and neoclassical special results hold.If mpc+mpi&lt;1,you automatically obtain multiple equilibria.Involuntary unemployment exists and it will be impossible for labor,as a whole,to increase employment by cutting the money wage.In fact,to satisfy the necessary condition for optimality,the money wage must rise.The fundamental problem is with the mpi .The existence of Keynesian Uncertainty and/or Ellsbergian Ambiguity explains why investment spending will be a  volatile,unstable,highly variable,unpredictable outcome.	2005-10-04

Unfortunately,R added a chapter seven,titled\\"Keynes's Marshallian Heritage\\".This chapter is a total disaster.R simply accepts at face value the extremely poor assessments made about Keynes's A Treatise on Probability(1921;TP)by F Ramsey in two book reviews,written in 1922 and 1926,respectively.The fundamental error made by Ramsey was to assert,without any kind of deductive proof,that all probability estimates must be precise,numerical numbers.Ramsey essentially read only one chapter,chapter 3,of the TP.Ramsey completely misinterpreted Keynes's meaning of the words \\"nonnumerical\\" and \\"nonmeasurable\\" to mean that ,excepting cases where the principle of indifference could be applied,numerical estimates of probability could not be made.Thus Ramsey's silly characterization of Keynes's approach to measurement as talking about a nonnumerical height of a mountain and nonnumerical degrees of rational belief.Ramsey never took the time to read parts II and III of the TP.Nonnumerical was EXPLICITLY DEFINED on p.160 to mean\\"... BETWEEN(Keynes's emphasis)numerical limits\\".On pp.161-163 and pp.186-194 of the TP,Keynes adapts Boole's 1854 approach into an explicit,detailed mathematical method of specifying intervals.Keynes called this approach\\"approximation\\".These intervals Keynes called standard probabilities.\\"If we can place a probability in an order of magnitude with some standard probability,we can obtain its approximate measure by comparison\\".(Keynes,1921,p.160).Furthermore,\\"This method is frequently adopted in common discourse\\".(Keynes,p.160).R bases his whole chapter seven argument on Carabelli's claim,enthusiastically supported by Moggridge and Skidelsky,that Keynes's common discourse method allowed no numbers to be used in the estimation of probabilities since these estimates had to be nonnumerical.This bizarre conclusion then leads to the claim that only ordinal comparisons were allowed by Keynes in the TP .Of course, Keynes's \\"common discourse\\"method is directly  opposed to the claims of  Runde,Carabelli,O'Donnell,Fitzgibbons,Cottrell,and a horde of other writers,upon whom R bases his chapter 7 on,that, at best,Keynesian probability involves ordinal rankings of some probabilities some of the time.All economists,who write on Keynes's TP basically read only chapter 3.In Part III of the TP,Keynes defines a finite probability as a probability that is greater than both numerical and nonnumerical probabilities.These finite probabilities are the foundation of all of Keynes's results in Part III of the TP.	2005-09-23

MV=PO is a correct specification of the equation of exchange only if risk,measured by the normal probability distribution's standard deviation(or the standard deviation divided by the mean),is the only decision theoretic variable.All current forms of the equation of exchange ignore ambiguity and/or uncertainty and conflate risk with uncertainty.The equation of exchange has been misspecified from Hume to Friedman and Lucas.Only Keynes correctly derived a generalized equation of exchange.Keynes's analysis is contained on p.209 and chapter 21 of the GT.Lucas has already admitted that his framework of analysis breaks down completely if Keynesian uncertainty or Ellsbergian ambiguity prevents him from using his normal probability distribution.The massive 50 plus years of statistical analysis by Benoit Mandelbrot of data from all financial markets(stock,money,commodities,futures,currencies,bond) provides overwhelming empirical support for not using the normal distribution.Keynes,of course,would agree that, if the only decision theoretic variable of consequence is risk(Mandelbrot's mild risk),velocity would be stable or predictable.The fact that velocity is not constant or predictable means that Friedman's monetarism is only a very special case of Keynes's general theory,which,in terms of Mandelbrot's definitions,deals with mild and wild risk.Friedman can only deal with mild risk.	2005-09-18

Friedman's claim that the GT is based on excessive liquidity preference follows from his acceptance of the LJ Savage approach to probability.Unfortunately for Friedman,there is vast empirical evidence to support the existence of decision making under conditions of uncertainty or ambiguity.One can see the progress Keynes made by comparing the Tract with chapter 21 of the GT.Friedman works with the standard equation of exchange,MV=PO.This is misspecified.The correct generalized equation is M(Vw)=PO,where w is the weight of the evidence.Friedman has a special theory based on the assertionthat w=1.Only risk considerations determine the demand for money.	2005-09-15

Keynes compares his formal model to Pigou's 1933 model in the appendix to chapter 19 of the GT(General Theory,1936).Only if mpc+mpi=1 does the Pigouvian result occur.Backhouse simply repeats the false claims of those,such as Leontief,who claim that Keynes was guilty of\\"implicit theorizing\\".Backhouse claims that Keynes's theory was not derived from microeconomic foundations.All the microeconomic foundations,expressed in the form of elasticity analysis,is present in chapters 10,20,and 21.Finally,Backhouse claims that it was Lucas who was the first to construct macroeconomic models on a microeconomic foundation of optimizing behavior by economic agents.This claim is false since both Pigou,in his 1933 book,The Theory of Unemployment,based all of his macro results contained in Part II of his book on optimizing behavior.Keynes did the same.Backhouse is simply ignorant of the mathematical modeling done by both Keynes and Pigou in the early to mid 1930's.Whatever interpretations Backhouse makes are ,unfortunately,based on a lack of understanding of what Pigou and Keynes were doing in their books.	2005-09-14

The Elias book's prediction is not as bad as the Glassman and Hassett book or the Kadlec mess.Elias postulates that there would be major technological breakthroughs in this time period that would lead to major innovations creating major increases in productivity generated economic growth.If such technical advances do not occur it follows that Dow 40,000 in 2016 will not occur.A Dow 40,000 is possible in 2040-2050 if the massive,necessary spending on needed public infrastructure,badly neglected in the USA since 1981,is implemented.The bill is about 20 Trillion.This would set off a genuine boom and not a supplyside bubble.	2005-09-07

Einhorn	Books	3	4	6	N	N	The insights into decision making are incomplete and limited	This book is a collection of essays in honor of Hillel Einhorn ,whose death at the early age of 46 in 1987 is a tragedy.Einhorn's main interest in decision theory(science?) was decision making under uncertainty/ambiguity.Much of his scholarly output was in association with Robin Hogarth,the editor of this book.Both Einhorn and Hogarth were unaware of the work on decision making under uncertainty/ambiguity undertaken by J M Keynes in his A Treatise on Probability(1921;TP)and the informal extension made by Keynes in his 1936 book,The General Theory, as well as the major advances made by D.Ellsberg in his unpublished 1962 dissertation(published in 2001 by Garland Press as \\"Risk,Ambiguity,and Decision\\").A reader, who is aware of these sources, can admire the technical exposition of these collected essays(as well as the technical expertise of Einhorn's work)while also recognizing the limited originality of this work in the light of the work of Keynes and Ellsberg.For instance,the main Einhorn-Hogarth model of decision making under ambiguity that allowed for ambiguity preference,as well as avoidance,and incorporated a variable to account for the attitude of the decision maker towards ambiguity,does not represent any significant advance over the \\"Restricted Bayes/Hurwicz criterion\\" contained in chapter 7 of Ellsberg(2001,pp.194-202).The essays in this book by Wallsten,Edwards,and Lichtenstein,Slovic,and their coauthors,make for interesting reading ,as does the essay by Payne and his coauthors.Unfortunately,they also contain errors of omission/commission.The assessment made about  Keynes's views in the TP by Wallsten are all incorrect(See Wallsten,pp.31-32)and appear to be based on parts of chapter III  of the TP only.This is exactly the same error committed by Frank Ramsey in 1922 and 1926 in his error filled reviews of the TP.It is simply false to state,as Wallsten does,that\\"Keynes suggested that it would occasionally be possible to put bounds on numerical probabilities...in which case...the probability is only known vaguely.\\"(Wallsten,p.32).The vast majority of Keynesian probabilities are interval estimates.Similarly, the claim that \\"...virtually all decision theories share the idea that degrees of uncertainty can be represented uniquely and numerically by a probability measure...\\"(Wallsten,p.32)means that the message of Ellsberg(who uses sets of probability distributions) and Keynes has still not gotten through yet.	2005-07-15

Hayek, Vol 9)	Books	5	3	3	N	N	The difference between fixed and circulating capital is fundamental	This particular volume of Hayek's collected works covers the very important exchanges between Hayek and Keynes over Keynes's theories of investment and capital originally put forth in 1930 in the Treatise on Money(two volumes).Keynes's General Theory(1936) approaches to investment and capital are the same as in the TM except for Keynes's decision to  greatly emphasize the importance of the uncertainty of the information and knowledge base(or,in Ellsberg's terminology,the ambiguity of such information and knowledge) in economic decision making concerning future events(about investment in fixed capital subject to technological change and obsolescence) where the probabilities are both unreliable and unclear.Keynes and Hayek have completely opposite  positions concerning the differences between fixed capital,subject to the impact of uncertainty in decision making,and circulating capital,subject to the impact of risk,but not uncertainty.Hayek is very clear-there is no fundamental difference between fixed capital and circulating capital:\\"To over-emphasize the distinction between fixed and circulating capital,which is, at best,merely one of degree,and not by any means of fundamental importance,is a common trait of English economic theory and has probably contributed more than any other cause to the unsatisfactory state of the English theory of capital at the present time\\".(Hayek,p.177;see also pp.86,99-100,103-108,168-170,etc.).Hayek's misbelief that he could present a theory of capital that abstracts from uncertainty is in direct contradiction to Keynes's theories that argue[for a modern ,mathematical treatment of Keynes's theories,see any article or book by Dixit and Pindyck on the \\"real options\\" approach to investment projects that are fixed(sunk ,durable capital)]that uncertainty and/or ambiguity is fundamental and any attempt to abstract from it can only result in a very special theory applicable in conditions where there is no uncertainty.This book shows the immense gulf that separated Keynes and Hayek intellectually.While Hayek would later acknowledge the importance of uncertainty after the appearance of the General Theory,uncertainty has NO impact at all in the final conclusions reached by Hayek concerning investment and the business cycle.Since uncertainty makes absolutely no difference in the final decision outcome,there is no difference at all between Hayek and a neoclassical economics based on the Ramsey,De Finetti,and Savage subjective approach to decision making.	2005-07-11

Keynes's general theory of employment generalizes this to read as w/p=mpl/(mpc+mpi),where mpc is the marginal propensity to spend on consumption goods and mpi is the marginal propensity to spend on investment goods.Unless mpc+mpi = 1,some level of involuntary unemployment will always be present in the economy macroscopically; it will be mathematically and economically impossible for labor to cut its money wage in order to reduce unemployment,as recommended by the special neoclassical theory of employment.The author of this book failed in his goal because he lacked appropriate training in calculus.Anyone who attempts to read the GT without a calculus background will be unable to comprehend the technical analysis provided by Keynes in Part V of the GT.A reader, who is satisfied with knowing only Keynes's major result and doesn't care to go through the mathematical analysis of how Keynes derived this result in chapter 20 ,need only turn to pp.261-262 of the GT where Keynes spells it out :full employment requires that either the mpc=1 or that the mpc+mpi =1.The main reason Keynes gave for the failure of the private sector to generate a full employment level of output is that private decision making concerning how much to spend on investment goods is usually done under conditions of uncertainty and/or ignorance as opposed to risk.This explains the great volatility and instability in private sector spending[Ellsberg(2001)presents a model that can be used as a generalization of Keynes's rationale in chapter 7 of his decision theory book] on investment.Nowhere in this book or in Chick's book is this theoretical result mentioned or discussed.	2005-07-08

Cowell,titled \\"Microeconomic Principles\\".Cowell has recently come out with another similar microeconomics text in 2005.I have not read this book so I have no idea about its relative merits.In my opinion,Cowell's 1986 book is also superior to both H R Varian's and D M Kreps's introductory ,graduate micro course textbooks.	2005-07-04

Nelson totally misstates Adam Smith's position again and again and again throughout this book.There is not a single page in this book that, even remotely,provides the reader with a firm foundation about what Smith's system of classical liberty really  entailed.Nelson's assessments of Smith's system are about as accurate as the entirely false claim that John Maynard Keynes was an advocate of deficit finance(Keynes was a stauch opponent of deficit finance throughout his life.It is simply false to state that Keynes favored deficit finannce).Nelson claims the following:\\" As Adam Smith now interpreted the natural laws of economics,governments that sought to interfere with the individual pursuit of self interest in the market were acting contrary to the devine plan.The results were only likely to cause wide social disruption and distress-just as would any government action that in the physical order might be foolishly taken in attempted defiance of the law of gravity\\".(Nelson,p.287 :see also,for example,pp.44,84,89,191,etc.).Nelson,Samuelson, Friedman,and the rest of the economics profession have it all wrong and  upside down.Smith certainly recognized that the Invisible Hand process of the division of labor and labor specialization  created great wealth and economic growth.However,he also clearly recognized that it simultaneously generated massive undepletable ,detrimental externalities impacting the entire work force that only government actions could reduce,mitigate,or minimize.This is all clearly stated on pp.734-741 of the Modern Library (Cannan)edition of the Wealth of Nations.Nelson's book is intellectually unsatisfactory in its present state.The Invisible Hand has absolutely nothing to do with God,Divine Providence,or religion at all.It is a purely human economic-social process that leads to positive changes over time in a society because both the individual and society(all other individuals) benefit from the additional expertise and training as new specializations are created over time . Unfortunately,this process also has a dark side that Smith recognizes can only be effectively dealt with by government action.Period.Nelson needs to read what Smith actually said and initiate substantial CHANGES IN HIS NEXT EDITION.	2005-06-28

Buchanan's(JMB)book is completely mistitled and out of date.Nowhere in any of Keynes's writings does Keynes ever advocate a policy of deficit finance,which is actually the brain child of Abba Lerner,a member of the American Keynesian-Neoclassical Synthesis school of economics.Lerner used the term functional finance to describe deficit finance.During a visit to America in 1944 as the representative of England's Treasury Department,Keynes totally disagreed with Lerner's approach.Keynes's approach is an advanced version of the cyclically balanced budget first laid out in clear terms to the Pharaoh by Joseph some 3,700 years ago-build up a surplus in the good years that will cover the deficits of the bad years.This is the first statement of what economists call a countercyclical fiscal policy.Keynes's additional provision is that the budget be split into two categories-one of which would be a capital budget.The government could only run deficits in the provision of capital projects in public infrastructure(building dams,reservoirs,water projects-irrigation networks,seaports,airports,public transportation projects,public schools,colleges and universities,public research laboratories,etc.,)that would pay for themselves in the long run.Nor was Keynes an advocate of tax cuts in an economic downturn except for temporarily suspending the  social security tax for workers only.Keynes's major policy recommendation was the maintenance of low interest rates combined with a central bank policy of eliminating loan availability for speculative undertakings(greenmail,leveraged buyouts,hostile takeovers,margin account loans,corporate raiders,junk bonds,etc.).The correct title for JMB's book up until 1981 is\\"Democracy with minor to moderate deficits:The Political Legacy of the American Keynesian-Neoclassical Synthesis School\\".After 1981,JMB should have retitled his book as\\"Democracy and Catastrophic Deficits:The Political Legacy of Laffer,Reagan,and the 12 years of the Two  Bush Presidencies\\" .The national debt when President Reagan took office stood at 925 billion dollars.As of July,2005,the national debt will have surpassed 8 trillion dollars.The Libertarian-pseudo conservative policies of tax cuts,borrowing and excessive spending of  8 years of Reagan and 12 years of the two Bush presidencies has increased our national debt by a factor of 9.JMB needs to completely rewrite his book.First,he needs to incorporate the theoretical foundations of the story of Joseph and the Pharaoh from the Old Testament.He will probably need to purchase a bible in order to correctly cite verse and page.Second,he needs to obtain a copy of Keynes's General Theory and read what Keynes actually wrote and not what Henry Hazlitt claims what Keynes meant in his 1959 \\"Failure of the 'New Economics'\\".	2005-06-26

Knight (Elgar Monographs)	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Greer lacks  the necessary technical training about Keynes's TP	Greer's major point is certainly correct.Keynes viewed the problem of uncertainty as generating negative,detrimental impacts on society as a whole because businessmen would make decisions about the capital stock(investment)that were suboptimal.Government economic,tax,fiscal,and monetary(institutions)policies could reduce this uncertainty and hence create an atmosphere that would result in expectations of future profits and returns that were optimistic.This would in turn lead to more investment and a full employment level of output at noninflationary levels.Knight,on the other hand,argued against such uncertainty reducing actions on the part of the government authorities on the grounds that they would lead to an overexpansion of Government power and control that would threaten the economic and political liberties of the private sector. Greer does an above average job when it comes to a discussion of Knight's approach to analysing the effects of uncertainty in the private sector.Unfortunately,his treatment of Keynes's underlying theoretical and technical foundations that support his discussions of expectations,probability,and uncertainty in the General Theory are deficient and defective.Greer appears to assume that by uncertainty,Keynes meant the irreducible or fundamental uncertainty of Post Keynesian theorists like G L S Shackle and Paul Davidson.There is no support for this claim.Uncertainty for Keynes ,in both the GT AND TP ,was a range that proceeded in gradations from little,mild,or moderate uncertainty through moderate,severe,and acute uncertainty to total or complete uncertainty[the fundamental or irreducible uncertainty of post keynesian and institutionalist economists that Keynes ,in the A Treatise on Probability(1921;TP),modeled as ignorance.Ignorance was defined as having a weight of the evidence,w,equal to 0(Keynes's index for w is mathematically identical to the rho index of D.Ellsberg)].Only in this very extreme case would probabilities,which were mainly intervals for Keynes,not be able to be calculated.The real problem in decision making is the reliability of probabilities calculated on a small amount of evidence and the difficulty in analysing interval estimates that overlap.Greer has absolutely no knowledge of or understanding about Keynes's interval estimate approach to probability.	2005-06-25

mpc+mpi=1	Kates has written a book that makes four basic claims,none of which he  comes close to supporting effectively.Kates first claim is that no one really knows what it was that Keynes did in the General Theory(GT;1936).Second,Kates claims that classical and neoclassical economists had a theory of recession and involuntary unemployment prior to the publication of the GT.Third,Kates claims that the literary definition of Say's Law given in chapter 3 of the GT,that\\"Supply creates its own Demand\\",is incorrect and that by Say's Law Classical and Neoclassical economists meant that it was mathematically impossible for demand deficiency to ever occur in a free market economy.The idea of demand deficiency is thus a logical fallacy as well as being mathematically impossible.Finally,Kates argues that Say's Law needs to be reincorporated in current,modern,macroeconomic theory since increased  spending to fight the nonexistent problem of demand deficiency merely leads to the creation of inflation.Kates bases his argument on a compilation of a huge number of literary quotations taken from the works and textbooks of 19th and early 20th century economists,such as Mill,Clay,Ely,Thomas,McCulloch,Southworth,etc.Unfortunately,all of the vast number of quotations assembled by Kates are mere assertions.There is not a single piece of formal and/or technical analysis in any of the quotations presented.The lack of any formal mathematical and/or logical analysis of either Keynes's arguments or the literary arguments of the classical and neoclassical opponents of Keynes points to the conclusion that Kates is mathematically illiterate,inept,and inumerant.This conclusion is supported and  borne out by the factthat Kates completely overlooks the fact that Keynes presented  a technical analysis of Say's Law in chapters 19-21 of the GT.Kates relies on an introductory chapter of the GT,chapter 3,which contains an informal guide to Keynes's full scale argument in chapters 19-21.There is no formal or mathematical analysis contained in chapter 3 at all.On pp.261-263 of the GT,Keynes presents his major TECHNICAL conclusion-If,and only if,the marginal propensity to spend is equal to 1 will Say's Law hold and no involuntary unemployment will be present in the economy.Keynes then derives the following optimality condition in both of chapters 20 and 21:w/p=mpl/(mpc+mpi),where mpc is the marginal propensity to spend on consumer goods,mpi is the marginal propensity to spend on investment goods,and mpl is the aggregate marginal product of labor derived from a neoclassical aggregate production function.The marginal propensity to spend is equal to the sum of mpc+mpi in a purely competitive private economy with a private commercial banking system and no government sector or foreign trade.If mpc+mpi=mpc+mps=1,then,and only then,will Say's Law hold.Kates has completely overlooked Keynes's discussions of the competing classical and neoclassical business cycle theory contained in chapters 18 and 22 of the GT.Such a theory has two points-(1)The average or mean position of the economy is one of full employment on the boundaries of the static and dynamic production possibilities frontier and(2)Minor and mild inventory recessions will occur as business men will make minor forecast errors concerning the composition of the full employment level of output over time.Such miscalculations about the particular mix of consumption and investment goods to provide a full employment economy will periodically lead to necessary adjustments in employment as the particular product mix is adjusted over time.During this inventory adjustment period there will be an increase in unemployment.A minor and mild recession will occur that is selfcorrecting and selfadjusting as the inventory errors are automatically corrected.Keynes covers this type of outcome on page332 of the GT at the end of chapter 22.This has absolutely nothing to do with the business cycle problem analyzed by Keynes in the GT,which dealt with the effect of uncertainty(Ellsberg's ambiguity)in leading to severe shortfalls in spending on fixed capital goods .The result is a severe recession or depression .Such results are mathematical and statistical impossibilities in the classical and neoclassical theories which assume only risk and no uncertainty(ambiguity).Keynes's theory is that the average operating position of the economy is inside the  boundary of both the static and dynamic ppf's, due to the impact on the economy of business

T ignores and/or overlooks the very specific mathematical and logical constructs created ,not only by Keynes in 1921 and 1936,but by Ellsberg in 1961 and 1962.At the individual micro level,Keynes's index to measure w,the completeness of a decision maker's information set or the weight of the evidence(the uncertainty of the GT is an inverse function of w),defines the variable w to be an element of the unit interval [0,1].Ellsberg defines his variable,rho,used to measure the degree of confidence of a decision maker in his information set,to be an element of the unit interval [0,1].If w=1 or rho =1(the individual's information set is complete and has no ambiguity ) and all probabilities are linear so that there are no nonlinear probabilities(subadditive or superadditive decision weights),then one obtains the special case of classical or neoclassical decision making under risk and/or certainty equivalences.Using Tobin as an example ,he implicitly assumes that w(rho)=1 and all probabilities are linear.How does Keynes express this analysis at the macrolevel?On pp.261-262 of the GT,Keynes gives the corresponding macro condition that incorporates the problem of decision making under ambiguity/uncertainty at the microlevel.It is that the mpc(marginal propensity to consume)=1.If the capital stock is not at an optimal level,then the condition is expressed as mpc+mpi=1,where mpi is the marginal propensity to invest.The effect of individual,microscopic decision making under uncertainty/ambiguity/ignorance will manifest itself macroscopically in the mpi term.Thus,mpc+mpi will in general be less than 1.Keynes derived the following optimality condition in chapters 20 and 21 of the GT that incorporates this condition,based on a microfoundations at the firm-industry level using the theory of purely competitive firms.The condition is that w/p=mpl/(mpc+mpi),where the mpl is the marginal product of labor derived from an aggregate production function.If mpc+mpi&lt;1(the marginal propensity to spend is less than 1),then involuntary unemployment will exist and labor,as a whole,will be unable to eliminate this type of unemployment by cutting their money wage.Thus,Keynes proved mathematically that the logical reason for the existence of involuntary unemployment at the macroscopic level is the existence of ambiguity/uncertainty at the microeconomic level.T covers none of the specifics of Keynes's argument at the mathematical or logical level.He is ,however,on the right track and a reader of this review would benefit from buying this book and absorbing the contents.	2005-05-25

Samuelson and J.M.Keynes are incorrect	Mirowski's(M)book correctly points out that Samuelson's attempt to model economics \\"as if\\" it was the physics of Boltzmann and Gibbs fails to incorporate the  20th century physics of Einstein(the special theory of relativity(1904) and the general theory of relativity(1915)).However,if Samuelson had discovered the special nature of neoclassical economics,then he,and not John Maynard Keynes,would have been the greatest economist of the 20th century.Mirowski generally is correct that the economics profession has been too engrossed in the advanced Newtonian physics of the 1870-1900 time period.Of course,it is this type of physics that Samuelson was taught in his engineering physics courses when he was a student in the early 1930's(the same conclusion holds for this reviewer in the early 1970's).Unfortunately,Mirowski,instead of correctly pointing out that,despite Samuelson's great technical skills and ingenuity,such an approach could only yield special conclusions(Samuelson did point out that neoclassical theory is strictly limited to an analysis of points lying on the boundary of the static and dynamic production possibilities curves in his principles textbook),appears to come very close to claiming that Samuelson is a scientific fraud .Mirowski's claims are simply false. The second major problem with this book is in its assessment of Keynes's General Theory(GT;1936).Every statement about Keynes and the General Theory in this book is either an error of omission or an error of commission.Mirowski's knowledge of Keynes's mathematical modeling approach in chapters 20 and 21 of the GT is nonexistent.Mirowski's reliance on the error filled commentaries of the mathematically  and economically illiterate,inept,and innumerant accountant,Hugh Townshend,whom Mirowski describes as\\"...a spectacularly perceptive critic...\\"(Mirowski,p.411)means that he has absolutely no idea of what Keynes is doing.On pp.261-262 of the GT,Keynes gives,not once but twice,the sufficient macroscopic optimality condition required for there to be no involuntary unemployment.It is that the marginal propensity to spend must equal 1.Unless this condition is met,no amount of wage and price flexibility ,even if instantaneous and simultaneous in all markets,will have any effect.Formally ,the mpc must equal 1.If the capital stock is not at an optimal level,then the mpc+mpi=1=mpc+mps condition is required,where mpc is the marginal propensity to spend on consumption goods,mpi is the marginal propensity to spend on investment goods,and mps is the marginal propensity to save.In chapters 20 and 21,Keynes derives this condition from the ground up,using a microfoundations of firms/industries operating under conditions of pure competition.This condition,which any competent mathematician can derive,is that w/p=mpl/(mpc+mpi),where mpl is the aggregated marginal product of labor.If mpc+mpi&lt;1,involuntary unemployment will automatically exist.Keynes demonstrated that the capitalist system is ,in fact, a system of multiple,stable equilibria.Due to the ignorance of Mirowski, concerning Keynes's Einsteinian revolution in economics,his explicit unsupported attack on P. Samuelson,and his implicit attack ,again unsupported,on John Maynard Keynes,I can't recommend the purchase of this book unless it undergoes a complete revision,concentrating on the deficiencies of modeling economics on late 19th century Newtonian physics only.Mirowski could have written a 5-star book.Instead,he mixs his correct assessment of the misguided attempts of the economics profession to model economics as if it were physics with a series of unsupported attacks on Samuelson and Keynes.	2005-05-18

These types of probabilities are thus \\"non-numerical\\"because you are not using a single numeral.In 1922 and 1926,Frank Ramsey reviewed Keynes's book based on his reading of chapters 1-4 plus 3 pages from Part two and 4 pages from Part five.Keynes's discussion of non-numerical probabilities takes place in chapters 5,10,15 and 17.Keynes then applies his new approach to induction and analogy in chapters 20 and 22,using his concept of \\"finite probability\\"which applies to both precise numerical probabilities and imprecise non-numerical probabilities.All of Keynes's discoveries ,however,were ignored by the ignorant Ramsey.(To this day(2005)one can regularly read about Keynes's \\"strange,mysterious,unfathomable,undefined\\"non-numerical probabilities in literally hundreds of economics and philosophy journal articlesthat are based primarily  on Ramsey's reviews.These reviews are still cited as \\"overwhelming\\" evidence that Keynes agreed that Ramsey's critique had demolished the entire structure of his logical approach to probability.Nothing could be further from the truth.Ramsey's reviews were so poor that Keynes and Bertrand Russell attempted to downplay their relevance so as to save Ramsey from being embarrassed in the academic community.)Keynes then showed that interval estimates,because they overlap,would very likely also,in many cases,be noncomparable and/or nonrankable if a decision maker used such order preserving operators like\\"greater than or equal to\\"or \\"less than or equal to\\".While this is quite obvious,it went completely over Ramsey's head. Keynes's second major advance was to create his \\"conventional coefficient of weight and risk\\", c=p/(1+q)[2w/(1+w)]. The goal of the decision maker is to Maximize cA,where A is some outcome.This decision rule solves all of the paradoxes and anomalies that plague subjective expected utility theory.A major accomplishment made by Keynes in chapter 26 of the TP was to specify that the weight of the evidence variable,w,was defined on the unit interval [0,1].It would be forty years before Daniel Ellsberg would define his practically identical variable,rho,on the unit interval between 0 and 1 also,where rho measured the degree of confidence in the decision maker's information base.Since these two measures are one to one onto and isomorphic,Keynesian weight(uncertainty in the General Theory) and Ellsbergian ambiguity measure the same thing and are interchangeable.This means that Ellsberg's analysis can be applied when studying the GT and used to buttress Keynes's theory of liquidity preference in the GT.In Part 5 of this book ,Keynes showed how one could use Chebyshev's Inequality as a lower bound to the normal probability distributions overly precise point estimate . Part 5 of the Treatise also includes Keynes's advocacy of the Lexis Q test for stability of a statistical frequency[law of large numbers].It is this part of the TP that forms the basis,along with chapter 17,of Keynes's exchange with Tinbergen over the logical foundations of econometrics in the Economic Journal in 1939-1940.Keynes pointed out that ,in order to justify his assumption of normality,Tinbergen needed to apply the Lexis Q test.Tinbergen never applied either that test or the Chi- Square test for goodness of fit.This will then bring the reader back to Keynes's chapter 8 of the Treatise ,where he presents his own logical frequency interpretation of probability as a special case of his general logical approach to probability. <br />	2005-05-17

Commons,etc.)or b)contain serious mathematical errors of exposition.McCloskey makes the following claim:\\"This is why obscure texts are often influencial.Keynes left many opportunities for readers to run their own motion pictures,filling in the blanks\\".(McCloskey,p.73).The fact is that the opposite is the case.On pp.261-262,Keynes spells out the major formal mathematical conclusion in his GT twice.Only a mathematically illiterate,inept,and innumerant reader would not be able to follow Keynes's meaning.Keynes states that the nescessary and sufficient optimality condition for a macroeconomy to have no involuntary unemployment presentis that the marginal propensity to consume is equal to 1.If investment spending is an option because the capital stock is not at an optimal level,then the mpc+mpi must equal 1,where mpc equals the marginal propensity to consume and mpi equals the marginal propensity to invest.Keynes then spends all of chapter 20  deriving his major mathematical conclusion,starting from the basic microfoundations of purely competitive firms and industries,that w/p=mpl/(mpc+mpi)is the required condition integrating the commodity  and labor markets.In chapter 21 he extends this basic condition to incorporate the money market.If mpc+mpi&lt;1,then it is impossible for labor,as a whole,to increase employment by cutting their money wage.Some level of involuntary unemployment will always be present in any macroeconomy where the marginal propensity to spend is less than one.There is simply no need for any application of hermeneutics because Keynes's analysis is mathematically clear and complete.Only if a reader is mathematically confused ,due to his own deficiencies, would it appear that interpretation was necessary.In fact,no interpretation would actually be needed.What would be needed would be training in differential and integral calculus.	2005-05-15

The first deficiency ,in this book as well as in the earlier book,is that the work of Benoit Mandelbrot is totally and completely ignored.The annual and quarterly gnp growth figures that appear throughout this book cry out for an explicit Mandelbrotian analysis(scaling and L-stable probability distribution approach).The second major deficiency is Ormerod's own mathematical innumeracy,illiteracy,and ineptness concerning the mathematical modeling used by Keynes in the General Theory(1936;GT)to prove mathematically that capitalist economies have multiple equilibria,only one of which would be a full employment equilibrium.All of the other possible equilibriums would involve unemployment equilibriums with a corresponding amount of involuntary unemployment that  would be impossible for labor,in the aggregate,to reduce by cutting their money wage.Keynes explicitly defines this necessary and sufficient optimality condition two times on pages 261-262 of the GT.In both chapters 20 and 21,Keynes derives the following condition derived from the microeconomic foundations of firms/industries operating under conditions of pure competition:w/p=mpl/(mpc+mpi).Unless the marginal propensity to spend(the sum of the marginal propensity to spend on consumption goods,mpc plus the marginal propensity to spend on investment goods,mpi)equals 1,involuntary unemployment exists in the macroeconomy.Ormerod,on the contrary,states that\\"Keynes's Theory seems very realistic and appealing,and it is one to which we return in the next chapter.But Keynes himself never articulated it in a formal way,as he himself recognized\\".(Ormerod,p.107).Another false claim is that Keynes never supplied any microfoundations for his theory.(See Ormerod,p.109,124).Ormerod lacks the knowledge of what it is that makes up Keynes's general theory.A reading of chapters 19,20,and 21 of the GT demonstrates that Keynes's general theory is still the economic theory with the most generality.If Ormerod wishes to supplement that theory he needs to read Keynes's work more carefully.No new general theory is needed at the present time in order to explain what is going on in capitalist economies.Ormerod does handle the question of forecasting correctly,although he ignores the crucial Keynes-Tinbergen exchange of 1939-1940 as well as Mandelbrot.	2005-05-15

Each one of the unemployment equilibriums would have a certain amount of involuntary unemployment associated with it.Finally,Keynes proved mathematically that in such situations it would be mathematically impossible for labor as a whole to reduce the unemployment rate by cutting the aggregated money wage,w.In chapter 19 on pp.261-262,Keynes presents the necessary and sufficient optimality condition required for there to be no involuntary unemployment.It was that the marginal propensity to spend must equal 1.The mpc+mpi must equal 1,where mpc equals the marginal propensity to spend on consumption goods and mpi equals the marginal propensity to spend on investment goods.In chapters 20 and 21,Keynes presents the mathematical details of his formal analysis, using standard elasticity analysis, and proves the statement on pp.261-262.The following condition is Keynes's general theory of employment:w/p=mpl/(mpc+mpi),where w/p is the real wage,p is the price level,and mpl is the marginal product of labor.Unless mpc+mpi =1,it is mathematically impossible for labor in the aggregate to increase employment by cutting the money wage.Every single economist interviewed by King in this book agrees that Keynes did NOT establish this result.Each Post Keynesian economist makes it clear,implicitly or explicitly, that Keynes WAS COMPLETELY UNCLEAR AND HAD NO CORRECT MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF HIS THEORY IN THE GT.I can't recommend this book .However,a negative reason for purchasing this book is that it illustrates the mathematical ineptness,innumeracy ,and illiteracy of all of the authors (and editor) concerning the use of elasticity analysis in economics in general and  especially in the economics of the 1930's.	2005-05-10

McCloskey)fails to realize that the problem facing econometricians is much,much more severe than just the apparent failure of most econometricians to  successfully differentiate between the concepts of statistical significance and economic significance.The problem is that econometric practice is founded on the a priori belief that practically all analysis of economic data can be based on the assumption of normality.In fact,the reverse is the case.In general,the normal probability distribution does not come close to being a correct statistical approximation of most economic data.This was the major point made by Keynes in his 1939-40 exchange with Tinbergen on the logical foundations of econometrics.It has been one of the major points made by Mandelbrot since the mid 1950's.Nowhere in Ziliak's essay will the reader get these points because neither Keynes nor Mandelbrot are mentioned anywhere.Gillies' article is marred by his failure to point out that the mathematics of field theory,electron spin theory,string theory and super string theory in mathematical physics ,like much of neoclassical economics,has little or no empirical and/or experimental support now or even in the distant future.Gillies' claim that Keynes's footnote on p.280 of the General Theory meant that the mathematical analysis in chapter 20 could be ignored  reveals Gillies' mathematical innumeracy and ineptness,since this chapter provides the mathematical proof of Keynes's claim that stable unemployment equilibriums, with associated involuntary unemployment levels,could occur due to the multiple equilibrium nature of capitalist economies.Of course,Keynes had explicitly provided his readers in chapter 19,pp.261-262,with the major result of his theory,that only in the case of a marginal propensity to spend with a value of 1(or if the mpc+mpi=1=mpc+mps,where the mpc is the marginal propensity to consume,mpi is the marginal propensity to invest,and mps is the marginal propensity to save)will a full employment equilibrium occur.Chapters 20 and 21 provide the interested reader with the formal mathematical derivation of the result stated by Keynes in chapter 19.Keynes successfully generalized neoclassical theory in chapters 20 and 21.Hence the footnote at the bottom of p.280.A reader who is not interested in the manner in which Keynes derived his result can skip this part ofthe chapter.In conclusion,Gillies' claim that the General Theory is a qualitative theory without any mathematical foundation is simply false(Gillies,p.197).Keynes's general theory is specified by the condition that w/p=mpl/(mpc+mpi),where w/p = the real wage.Keen's article claims that the theory of the perfectly competitive firm is based on a mathematical error.This claim is simply false.The theory is based on the subjective assumption by the owner of such a firm that it is impossible for him to raise or lower his price.Given this assumption,the firm's demand curve will appear as a horizontal line,which is the only way you can economically model such a firm.The conclusion is that he will receive the same price for different amounts of his output.Only after the basic economic assumptions have been specified will a mathematical representation consistent with the economic assumptions be supplied.The best exposition is in the third edition of C E Ferguson,1972,Microeconomic Theory,pp.123-124,251-253.Section 8.4,pp.255-270.Keen is correct that the 1957 article by Stigler in the Journal of Political Economy contains a mathematical error.Ferguson was well aware of this article(see Ferguson,1972,p.317).He correctly ignores Stigler's attempt to provide a purely mathematical foundation for the perfectly competitive firm without first specifying the economic assumptions that must go first.What is wrong with economics is the failure of the economics profession to grasp the mathematical proof that Keynes constructed in the GeneralTheory in chapters 20 and 21 or comprehend the optimality condition spelt out by Keynes on pp.261-262 of the General Theory. None of the authors in this book have the slightest clue about what Keynes did.It is better to go and buy a copy of the General Theory than purchase this book in its current form.	2005-05-08

It is the period from 1899 ,starting with the completely unjustified war against Filipino patriots,through the eight years of the Woodrow Wilson administration,1912-1920,that American military force is used in situations where no direct/indirect threat to American interests/borders starts to be undertaken .The best book to read concerning these unjustified military operations is still Marine General Smedley Butler's account.The main conclusion that can be derived from B's careful analysis of the historical record is that the term \\"isolationist\\"is a gravely inaccurate description of those Americans who opposed American entry into World Wars I and II,the Vietnam war and/or the second Iraq war of 2003-2006(?).One can,of course, disagree with the arguments put forth by those who opposed entry into these wars(i.e.,direct American interests were at stake).However,to label them as \\"isolationists\\", in an attempt to avoid having to meet  their arguments head on,is simply nonsensical.	2005-04-28

Only in the case where mpc+mpi=1 will the c-nc theory be operational.As pointed out by G,this is some point on the PPF boundary.This is where neoclassical and Austrian economic theory comes into play-explaining the underlying process over time that results in the picking of a (the) particular mix of consumption and investment goods,given resource scarcity,that businessmen will produce for sale in a free market.	2005-04-10

This book of collected essays is an excellent example of why the Post Keynesian,Institutionalist,and Cambridge Keynesian(neo Keynesian)schools of economics are practically on the brink of academic extinction.I will concentrate on essays 18,21 and 32 by Corry,Davidson,and Eatwell,respectively,but the criticisms made apply to practically all of the essays,which deal with a variety of issues ,such as the capital reswitching controversy,which dealt with a  capital stock that was  defined as a function of only one variable,a monotonically decreasing rate of interest,Keynes's General Theory and other aspects of his approach,the Cambridge Circus,the work of M Kalecki,the post keynesian school,and other assorted topics.The essays by Corry,Davidson and Eatwell deal specifically with the existence of involuntary unemployment and of an unemployment equilibrium,which should have  been described as a set of multiple equilibria,only one of which is a full employment equilibrium.The general approach of each author is to argue that Keynes was right,after which some quotations from Keynes's works are given in support of that conclusion.Then it is acknowledged that Keynes did not supply any formal or mathematical analysis proving the existence of either involuntary unemployment or an unemployment equilibrium.This kind of approach can only be read in one way.Keynes failed and his \\"theories\\"are nothing more than a series of empty assertions that have no scientific merit.Contrary to the conclusions reached by the  essayists in this book,Keynes provided a rigorous mathematical model,based on a series of elasticities that he constructed in chapters 20 and 21 of the General Theory,that generalized the classical and neoclassiacal theories.Keynes's major result is that w/p=mpl/(mpc+mpi),where w/p is the real wage,mpl is the marginal product of labor in the aggregate that is derived from an aggregate production function,and mpc and mpi are the marginal propensities to consume consumption goods and investment goods,respectively.If mpc+mpi &lt;1,then you automatically obtain any one of a number of different multiple equilibria plus some level of involuntary unemployment.Only if the mpc+mpi=1 will the neoclassical theory become operational.Not a single author in this book demonstrates that he/she has any idea of the nature of Keynes's technical analysis.They show an understanding only of the literary exposition.	2005-04-05

The goal of this book by E.Nell(N)is to write a new general theory of macroeconomics with clearly defined non neoclassical microeconomic foundations based on a new view of what  the equilibrating mechanism in the economy is.Nell argues that relative market prices(and a neoclassical anaysis relying on marginal product,cost and utility functions)have no substantial role to play.Instead,the equilibrating mechanism comes into play as society attempts to deal with and coordinate  a continuing series of technological innovations and changes over time.The dynamic interplay that occurs in society and between different sectors of the economy,like the consumption and investment goods sectors,creates both positive and negative feedback effects that generate changes in the structure of the economy over time.These changes result in changes in the basic structure of society.This general overview is one with which the reviewer has some agreement with.However,it is not necessary or correct to argue that neoclassical price theory has no use or valid or sound application.It has to play second fiddle to the first fiddle of technological change and innovation,as argued by both Schumpeter and Keynes.It is in Nell's dismissal of Keynes's theory of effective demand that Nell drops the ball , fumbles, and never recovers.Unfortunately,Nell simply accepts as the gospel truth the canards told to him by Richard Kahn and Joan Robinson about Keynes being a poor mathematician by 1927 who never mastered microeconomic theory and was thus unable to formalize his theory of effective demand,based on aggregate demand functions and aggregate supply functions(and not the single aggregate demand and supply function postulated by Nell).This is most evident whenever Nell discusses Keynes's modeling(Nell,1998,pp.373,449-453,545-557,613-622,especially pp.618-621).Nell examines only chapter 3 of the GT and ignores Keynes's analysis in chapters 19,20,21 and the appendix to chapter 19 .Any competent mathematician will be able to derive Keynes's major result,which was that w/p= mpl/(mpc+mpi).Unless mpc +mpi =1,a series of multiple equilibria can result that results in some level of involuntary unemployment.The single  equilibrium of neoclassical theory requires that mpc+mpi =1,where w/p= the real wage,mpl= the marginal product of labor ,and mpc and mpi equal the marginal propensities to spend on consumption and investment goods,respectively.Nell is not likely to ever succeed in his search for a new general theory until he realizes that Keynes's analysis,as given above,applies to both the short run and the long run(i.e.,both the static and the dynamic production possibilities curves).athematician will be able to derive Keynes's major result,which was that w/p= mpl/(mpc+mpi).Unless mpc +mpi =1,a series of multiple equilibria can result that results in some level of involuntary unemployment.The single  equilibrium of neoclassical theory requires that mpc+mpi =1,where w/p= the real wage,mpl= the marginal product of labor ,and mpc and mpi equal the marginal propensities to spend on consumption and investment goods,respectively.Nell is not likely to ever succeed in his search for a new general theory until he realizes that Keynes's analysis,as given above,applies to both the short run and the long run(i.e.,both the static and the dynamic production possibilities curves).	2005-04-01

Such are the beliefs of the post keynesians .Of course,any competent mathematician can derive Keynes's general theory result.It is that w/p=mpl/(mpc+mpi),where w/p is the real wage,mpl is the marginal product of labor,and mpc and mpi are the marginal propensities to consume consumption goods and investment goods,respectively.If mpc+mpi<1,then you obtain involuntary unemployment.Keynes would have some very serious reservations about a movement that emphasizes his obiter dicta,like animal spirits and conventions ,while ignoring the major result of the GT,which was the mathematical proof of the existence of involuntary unemployment.This book is just not worth buying in its present form.Most of the essays need a much more careful discussion of the philosophy of mathematics before they criticize the prevalent use of mathematical modeling in economics.	2005-04-01

Paul Ormerod's book correctly points out that the results of general competitive analysis,general equilibrium theory and neoclassical macroeconomic theory revolves around the concept of one single,unique, optimal,stable point of equilibrium that is presented mathematically as a fixed point based on any one of close to a hundred or so fixed point theorems that have been published in various math and economics journals since the early 1940's.This is identical to the claim that economies are always operating on the boundaries of their dynamic and static production possibilities curves(the stochastic equivalent is that ,on average,the mean position of every economy in the long run,operating without any government interference in the market,is on both boundaries ,combined with small deviations around the mean.These small deviations are interpreted as minor short run cases of recession and inflation that are self correcting through adjusting the mix of product inventories.)Ormerod shows, correctly,that such a theory,based on a misinterpretation and  misapplication  of the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem,is not supported by any empirical evidence.In fact, this approach is based on the fallacy of conditional a priorism(long runism).Ormerod then proposes to construct an alternative approach based on the existence of multiple equilibria.This is correct,but is redundant since Keynes already constructed such a theory in 1936 in his General Theory.Keynes's theory is based on the theory of effective demand.There are many unemployment equilibriums possible,but only one full employment equilibrium.The mathematical modeling for his theory was provided by Keynes in chapters 20 and 21 of the GT.Any competent mathematician should be able to derive Keynes's result,which is that w/p=mpl/(mpc+mpi),where mpl is the marginal product of labor,w/p is the real wage,and mpc and mpi are the marginal propensities to spend on consumption goods and investment goods,respectively.Multiple equilibria are specified as long as mpc+mpi <1.This result holds for both the short run and the long run.Involuntary unemployment is the result in either case.Only in the very special case of the mpc+mpi =1 will any of the various neoclassical theories be operational.Nevertheless,I still recommend this book for purchase since the discussion of multiple equilibria is more broad based than in the GT.Ormerod's deficiencies regarding Keynes's analysis in the GT can be traced back to his training in the economics department at Cambridge University,where\\"...Lord Kahn,revered as the closest collaborator of Keynes and ...credited in the oral tradition of Cambridge as having had the original insights which led to Keynes's theories\\".(Ormerod,p.116).There is no support for this claim,a claim that has misled literally hundreds of thousands of economists worldwide since the late 1930's.	2005-04-01

Norberg's book presents a number of libertarian arguments for globalization which he confuses with the  free trade argument  first made clearly by Adam Smith in 1776 and then presented in polished form by David Ricardo in 1817.There is no evidence in this book that Norberg understands the differences between theories of international trade based on absolute advantage(given two trading countries,one will win and one will lose)and comparative advantage(given two trading countries,both will win, although one country may benefit more than another).This is most likely due to Norberg's failure to spend any time in the study of economics at any level,be it the classic The Wealth of Nations(1776)or any principles level introduction to economics text.There are eleven assumptions that must hold in order to guarantee the conclusion of the free trade argument,which is that both countries will gain,either more or less.I will cover the two most important ones which most closely touch upon the differences between absolute and comparative advantage.Assumption one is that there can be no emigration or immigration of labor or capital(physical or financial)between trading countries.If this condition is violated,what results is not comparative or relative advantage ,leading to gains to both trading countries,but to absolute advantage,which leads to trading gains to one country,but losses to the other trading country.This is precisely what has happened over the last 25 years in the area of world trade.For example,the freeflow of private,highly speculative liquid capital,withdrawn instantaneously at a moment's notice once the smallest hint arouse that the expected gains forecast in the original time period that led to the foreign investment in the first place, were likely to be smaller or substantially smaller than expected,has created havoc in international currency,foreign exchange,and money markets,as well as to a substantial collapse in manufacturing-industrial capacity in those countries affected.Assumption two is that both trading countries must be operating on the boundaries of both of their static and dynamic production possibilities curves.If this condition is not satisfied ,the gains to free trade will not materialize.Practically all underdeveloped countries are operating within both boundaries.The conservative solution was given by Adam Smith in his discussion of free trade on pp.421-440 of the The Wealth of Nations over two hundred years ago.First,any transition to a free trade state must be slow and measured,allowing the individuals within any country the time needed to adjust to the new state of affairs,which for Smith was the gradual elimination of tariffs and foreign import duties.Second, it is the self interest of the private sector that will misrepresent the basic free trade argument,supporting it if they see a gain and opposing it if they see a loss.Third,the idea that the trading policy of any country will be a completely free trade one is simply a delusion that will never occur.This book certainly shows that some countries have made gains.Unfortunately,it ignore those countries that have suffered losses.Norberg needs to write a revised edition of his book that concentrates on the economic support for his position.The present book is simply deficient and will only be read by other libertarians who accept libertarian positions already.The exposition will fail to convince a conservative follower of Adam Smith or Edmund Burke.	2005-03-31

It will be an equilibrium.Keynes's generalized quantity equation  in chapter 21 clearly specifies the case of involuntary unemployment.	2005-03-29

Leijonhufvud(L)  shows in this book that there is more to the economics of the General Theory(GT;1936)and Keynes than the Income-Expenditure model and the IS-LM model.L correctly shows that the typical mid 1960's exposition of Keynesian economics in the textbooks had incorporated a number of errors compared to the Keynes of the A Treatise on Money(1930;TM) and the GT combined.L was correct to argue that the monetary emphasis of the TM was not contradicted by the apparent  superficial  treatment of monetary questions in the GT.Unfortunately,L completely overlooked Keynes's mathematical incorporation of his multiple equilibrium generalization of the special neoclassical theory of a single optimal equilibrium in chapter 21 of the GT on pp.304-306 of the GT in Keynes's generalized quantity theory of money equation,which ,of course,incorporated the chapter 20 analysis which Keynes restricted to the interaction between the labor and the goods markets.Chapter 21's generalized quantity theory of money equation analysis and exposition in the form of elasticities,which Keynes downplayed, would have cinched L's argument that the GT is in fact a clear extension of the TM.L went astray by  completely overlooking the nature of the mathematical D-Z model in the chapter in his book titled\\"Aggregative Structure of Alternative Models\\".Contrary to L ,Keynes presented both one and two sector models and makes clear use of an aggregated production function in the analysis of chapters 20 and 21.Thus,L's second purpose,to put forth a subjective ,positve alternative to the textbook Keynesianism of the mid 1960's,was not successful.I recommend this book because L successfully presented the case that any interpretation of the GT will be misleading if it fails to ground the GT in the TM.	2005-03-29

This book of collected essays(eight essays and an introduction)edited by J.Gay Tulip Meeks(M)combines some very good essays on benevolence and morals by Sen and Hahn with some very poor essays on rationality,decision making and J M Keynes's views on probability,induction,decision making and uncertainty as presented by Keynes in the A Treatise on Probability(1921;TP) and the General Theory(1936;GT)by Broome,Matthews,and Meeks.Broome appears to be ignorant of the fact that the entire Ellsberg Paradox literature, which demonstrates the inapplicability of Savage's sure thing principle to decision making under ambiguity, was completely anticipated by Keynes in his two Cambridge fellowship theses of 1907 and 1908 and in the TP of 1921.Keynes presented the first decision rule in the history of Decision Theory that made use of decision weights.He called this rule \\" a conventional coefficient of risk and weight,c\\".Keynes explicitly uses the c coefficient to solve the general form of the Ellsberg Paradox problem,as well as various other types of anomalies,such as preference reversals, on p.315,ft.2.Matthews and Meeks are likewise deficient in failing to specify the relationship that exists between the c coefficient and the investment decision making under uncertainty discussion that Keynes presented informally on pp.239-241 of the GT(the need to discount the NPV rule applied to the mec schedule in chapter 11 of the GT for both risk and uncertainty[liquidity preference]besides the discount for time preference).This discussion is directly related to Keynes's analysis of the investment decision making process in the long run under conditions of uncertainty in chapter 12 of the GT ,which is the main topic of both the essays by Matthews and Meeks.Another severe problem arises for Meeks explicitly and Matthews implicitly in their discussions of Keynes's approach to the quantification and measurement of probabilities.Meeks explicitly follows the unsupported and unsupportableclaims made by Sir Harold Jeffreys and Frank P Ramsey that  Keynes's meaning of the terms \\"nonnumerical\\" and \\"nonmeasurable\\"in chapter 3 of the TP  was that numbers could not be used ,in general,to measure a probability.Based on these false claims,it was then asserted that Keynes had created some kind  of a strange nonnumerical probability(ies) that did not obey the probability calculus.The best a decision maker could do in some limited instances was to possibly ordinally rank some of the relevant probabilities some of the time.A careful reading of chapters 3,5,10,15,17,20, and 22 of the TP reveals that most Keynesian probabilities are in fact interval estimates that require TWO NUMBERS,not one number,in order to quantify the probability relationship.The many errors in Meeks' paper(see pp.144-149 and pp.152-155) all revolve around her belief that Keynes's approach was aimed at \\"...providing some(almost always nonnumerical)'probable knowledge'of what is to come...\\"(Meeks,p.153).All of Keynes's analysis in Part III of the TP on analogy and induction is aimed at providing numerical limits for the inductive conclusions.Meeks's claim that the best a decision maker can do is to compare probabilities ordinally some of the time would vitiate all of Part III of the TP.	2005-03-27

Rogers(R) has provided an excellent general summary of the supporting  analysis used in the General Theory(GT)  by Keynes to analyze  his theory of effective demand from a strictly monetary point of view ,based on the application of his theory of liquidity preference explanation of the rate of interest as the return or reward for not \\"hoarding\\"(holding additional cash to self insure the decision maker against the uncertainty of the future as it relates to investing in fixed amounts of capital goods).Rogers covers Keynes's analysis,then,of the  money market alone,isolated from the labor market and the commodity(goods or output)market.The mathematical analysis of the money market,as it pertains to the theory of effective demand,is provided by Keynes on pp.304-306 of the GT as an addition to his mathematical modeling of the labor and commodity markets that is contained in chapter 20 of the GT.Unfortunately,R makes no use of these mathematically worked out results that  Keynes used in order to construct the mathematical proof of the existence of multiple equilibria ,which would include unemployment equilibria as well as  the existence of a single point of full employment called  a full employment equilibrium,that Keynes would make use of in the appendix to chapter 19  of the GT in order to demonstrate that Pigou's 1933 analysis in his The Theory of Unemployment in Part II,chapters 8-10,culminating in Pigou's p.102 proof was a special case that held only if an economy was operating on the boundaries of the static(short run) and dynamic(long run)production possibilities curves that required that the mpc+mpi=1.The loanable funds theory of the rate of interest is a special case that holds iff mpc+mpi(or,more generally,the mpsp=1)=1,where the mpc is the marginal propensity to spend on consumption goods,the mpi is the marginal propensity to spend on investment goods,and mpsp is the marginal propensity to spend on all goods,including imports,exports,and public goods.Roger's discussions on pp.219-223 of his book touch on all of these topics without ever presenting the explicit mathematical summary of the theory of effective demand that Keynes presented in the form of elasticities in chapters 10,20,and21 of the GT.Keynes's overall result is that w/p=mpl/(mpc+mpi),where w/p equals the real wage and mpl equals the marginal product of labor in the aggregate.If mpc+mpi&lt;1,then you automatically obtain an unemployment equilibrium.It is impossible for labor to cut their money wage in the aggregate as the LHS of the equation specifying the labor market optimum must increase in order to maintain the equality with the RHS.	2005-03-25

This book is a collection of essays on Keynes's General Theory(GT;1936)written by George Feiwel and a number of other economists. The most important essays in the book are the interviews conducted by Feiwel with Nobel Memorial Prize winners Robert M Solow,James Tobin and Franco Modigliani.The major theme running either explicitly or implicitly through most of the essays is that Keynes did not provide an explicit mathematical model,with microeconomic foundations,of his theory of effective demand in the GT.This was because Keynes\\"..did not take the twenty minutes necessary to master the theory of value...\\",(Feiwel,p.33,quoting Joan Robinson)and that\\"Joan Robinson(1976,p.28)suggested that Keynes 'did not accept the \\"perfect competition\\" of the textbooks but some old-fashioned notion of competition that he never formulated explicitly'.(Feiwel,p.34)Solow,in his essay,just repeats the claims made by Joan Robinson:\\"I still believe,by the way,that by anything like modern standards of theoretical rigor,there is nothing remotely like a proof in the General Theory of the possibility of equilibrium with involuntary unemployment.There is not even a clear definition of what it could mean.\\"(Feiwel,p.538).The major criticism of the claim of Solow and Feiwel is that Keynes provides precisely the proof that Joan Robinson,Solow,Feiwel and other economists claims he did not in chapter 20 of the GT on pages 282-286(p.283,ft.2) combined with the result in chapter 10,page 116,ft.2.Keynes then uses his result to critique A C Pigou's 1933 results in his The Theory of Unemployment in the appendix to chapter 19 of the GT.The result could not be more clearcut.The neoclassical special case is that a macroscopic equilibrium that is optimal occurs if w/p=mpl.Keynes's generalized result is that w/p=mpl/(mpc+mpi),where w/p equals the real wage,mpl equals the marginal product of labor,mpc equals the marginal propensity to spend on consumption goods,and mpi equals the marginal propensity to spend on investment goods .A macroscopic equilibrium that is optimal only occurs if mpc +mpi=1;if mpc+mpi&lt;1,an unemployment equilibrium occurs.I recommend that a reader of this review consider purchasing this book because it illustrates the standard,but mistaken,general view of all schools of economics that Keynes had no rigorous mathematical model of his theory in the GT.He did.	2005-03-24

This book consists of an introduction and 6 essays and comments.The essays are divided into two groups.The first group of essays,written by Amadeo,Harcourt,Sardoni,Lawlor and Bateman,is based on the assumption that Keynes provided no worked out mathematical model of his theory of effective demand in the General Theory(GT).These authors conclude that Keynes provided only a flawed literary discussion of what he was trying to say in the GT.Thus,Keynes needs to be interpreted(and reinterpreted,etc.).The criticism of this viewpoint is that any reader of this review who can differentiate and integrate can by inspection see that Keynes has a fully worked out mathematical model in chapters 20,21,and the appendix to chapter 19 in the GT.The second group of essays argues that Keynes was unclear,vague,and ambiguous about what he was doing in his 1921 A Treatise on Probability(TP).The essays by Davis  and Bateman and the comments by Dimand and Runde argue that Ramsey's two error filled book reviews of the TP in 1922 and 1926 caused Keynes to realize that there were no such things as objective partial logical degrees of entailment and/or rational degrees of belief.Thus,Keynes needs to be interpreted(and reinterpreted,etc.).The criticism of this viewpoint is that Ramsey's subjective approach to probability is a special case of Keynes's logical,objective theory which only holds if the weight of the evidence,w,is always equal to 1.Given the additional special assumptions that one is dealing with degrees of belief(not rational degrees of belief)and that  probabilities are always single,unique,precise numbers,then the probability calculus becomes a consistency and coherence constraint that operates to prevent the formation of a dutch book being made against a decision maker.This is all Keynes agreed to.Correctly,Keynes completely rejects the extremely weak argument made by Ramsey that analogy and induction are based on past memory and habits.	2005-03-23

V spends all of the second part of his book supposedly analyzing Keynes's analysis of his concept of involuntary unemployment as it was developed within the framework of his theory of effective demand.Unfortunately,V completely fails to consider the mathematical models presented by Keynes in chapter 10(the Y-multiplier model of actual aggregate demand where Y=C+I),chapters 20 and 21(the D-Z model consisting of a)D=f(N)=pO,the expected aggregate demand function,where p is an expected price and O=F(N)is an aggregate production function, defined as such on p.283 of the GT,(b)Z=g(N)=P +wN,the expected aggregate supply function,where P is future,expected profit,w is the money wage,either fixed or variable, and N is the aggregate amount of employment,(c)the aggregate supply curve, D=Z,which is a locus of the set of all possible expected  price-profit combinations,a different possible employment level corresponding to each member of the set.The aggregate supply curve,D=Z, automatically specifies a set of stable multiple equilibria,all of which satisfy the necessary  first order and sufficient second order conditions for a profit maximum derived from an optimization problem.Only one of the elements of this set will represent a full employment equilibrium.All of the other feasible points represent unemployment equilibriums,which Keynes designated as representing involuntary unemployment.In 1940,Keynes expanded his model' s range  of application informally so as to incorporate points of overemployment in  his How to Pay for the War.)and the appendix to chapter 19,where Keynes compared his model,theory,and results to the model,theory,and results derived by A C Pigou in Part II,chapters 8-10,pp.86-102,of The Theory of Unemployment(1933).Instead,V studies chapters 2,3,and 19 of the GT while ignoring chapters 10,20,21,and the appendix to chapter 19 of the same book.V's approach to \\"reading\\" the GT is based on five canards passed down to historians of economic thought and academic specialists in economic thought.The first canard is the claim made by Richard Kahn to Robert Skidelsky,who accepted it at face value,that Keynes was a poor mathematician by 1927.The second canard is the claim made by Joan Robinson that Gerald Shove told her that Keynes had never taken the twenty minutes necessary to master the theory of value.Naturally, Kahn(along with A.Robinson) claimed that Shove told him the same thing.The third canard was Dennis Robertson's claim,made in a 1955 article(with an error filled appendix by Harry Johnson) in the Economic Journal that was part of an error filled exchange over the meaning of Keynes's aggregate supply function between Robertson, De Jong and Ralph Hawtrey ,that pages 24-30 of the GT(chapter 3) contains the  important theoretical core that is central to an understanding of Keynes's theory of effective demand,despite Keynes's own assessment that chapter 3 was merely an introductory guide or outline of his theory that might be unintelligible until later chapters filled in all the missing analysis.The fourth canard was Johnson's claim that Z=pO(instead of the correct D=pO).The fifth canard was that,according to Robertson,D=C+I(instead of the correct Y=C+I).A mathematically literate reader of this review,who can differentiate and integrate, can easily duplicate any and all of the mathematical results obtained by Keynes in chapters 20 and 21.The major result is that the optimality condition for the labor market,making the standard assumption of decreasing returns to labor in the short run ,is determined in the commodity(output)market by the condition that w/p=mpl/(mpc+mpi),as opposed to the classical and neoclassical result that equilibrium in the labor market is determined independently of the commodity market by the condition w/p=mpl,where mpl is the marginal product of labor,mpc is the marginal propensity to spend on consumption goods andmpi the marginal propensity to spend on investmant goods.Only in the special case where mpc+mpi =1 will the neoclassical result(no involuntary unemployment)hold.I am now able to show why Keynes's two lines of argumentation are correct and why De Vroey and a host of other economists,who have accepted one or more of the five canards listed above,are incorrect in their reasoning.First,it is impossible for labor,in the aggregate ,to lower their money wage,w,as long as mpc+mpi&lt;1.Second,there is a deficiency of aggregate demand by definition as long as mpc+mpi&lt;1.There is nothing wrong with Keynes's reasoning,which follows strictly from a mathematical analysis of an aggregated economy operating under conditions of pure competition(KEYNES,1936)or free competition(PIGOU,1933).As pointed out by Keynes in the appendix to chapter 19 of the GT,the neoclassical analysis is missing an equation.That missing equation is the Y-multiplier model of chapter 10 of the GT.Of course,one can simply assume that mpc+mpi =1,just as the economist,who was taking a cruise with a physicist and a chemist and ends up on a deserted island after their ship sinks, assumes a can opener.nard is the claim made by Richard Kahn to Robert Skidelsky,who accepted it at face value,that Keynes was a poor mathematician by 1927.The second canard is the claim made by Joan Robinson that Gerald Shove told her that Keynes had never taken the twenty minutes necessary to master the theory of value.Naturally, Kahn(along with A.Robinson) claimed that Shove told him the same thing.The third canard was Dennis Robertson's

demand,despite Keynes's own assessment that chapter 3 was merely an introductory guide or outline of his theory that might be unintelligible until later chapters filled in all the missing analysis.The fourth canard was Johnson's claim that Z=pO(instead of the correct D=pO).The fifth canard was that,according to Robertson,D=C+I(instead of the correct Y=C+I).A mathematically literate reader of this review,who can differentiate and integrate, can easily duplicate any and all of the mathematical results obtained by Keynes in chapters 20 and 21.The major result is that the optimality condition for the labor market,making the standard assumption of decreasing returns to labor in the short run ,is determined in the commodity(output)market by the condition that w/p=mpl/(mpc+mpi),as opposed to the classical and neoclassical result that equilibrium in the labor market is determined independently of the commodity market by the condition w/p=mpl,where mpl is the marginal product of labor,mpc is the marginal propensity to spend on consumption goods andmpi the marginal propensity to spend on investmant goods.Only in the special case where mpc+mpi =1 will the neoclassical result(noinvoluntary unemployment)hold.I am now able to show why Keynes's two lines of argumentation are correct and why De Vroey and a host of other economists,who have accepted one or more of the five canards listed above,are incorrect in their reasoning.First,it is impossible for labor,in the aggregate ,to lower their money wage,w,as long as mpc+mpi&lt;1.Second,there is a deficiency of aggregate demand by definition as long as mpc+mpi&lt;1.There is nothing wrong with Keynes's reasoning,which follows strictly from a mathematical analysis of an aggregated economy operating under conditions of pure competition(KEYNES,1936)or free competition(PIGOU,1933).As pointed out by Keynes in the appendix to chapter 19 of the GT,the neoclassical analysis is missing an equation.That missing equation is the Y-multiplier model of chapter 10 of the GT.Of course,one can simply assume that mpc+mpi =1,just as the economist,who was taking a cruise with a physicist and a chemist and ends up on a deserted island after their ship sinks, assumes a can opener.	2005-03-06

US	26802692	R3VZLHAHIQ9LUR	0312129025	546223063	Hayek the Economist and Social Philosopher: A Critical Retrospect	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Keynes and Hayek talked to each other,but didn't listen	Frowen has edited an interesting collection of essays covering Hayek's work on such topics as his  general philosophy, his political and social philosophy,his approach to analyzing the role played by knowledge,information,partial knowledge and ignorance,his interactions with and critical assessments of Keynes's approach to capital theory,as well as Hayek's understanding of how society is able to solve the question of the economic coordination  of individual decision making problems intertemporally.I will concentrate the rest of the review on the essays(#1 and #11) contributed by Desai and Steele,as well as the comments of Holscher(who does a superb job in demonstrating the importance of the banker in making the credit available to the entreprenuer in order for him to even attempt to innovate),Chick,and Steele.A major error is made by Steele when he states that the \\"...General Theory incorporates no theory of capital\\".(p.258).Keynes's theory of capital is the standard analysis one finds specified in all current principles textbooks under the heading of Production Possibilities Frontier(PPF) or Curve analysis.In the 1930's-1940's this was called the Transformation Curve.Outside of one oblique reference on page 156,none of the author's of any of the essays mention this analysis when discussing Hayek's work and/or Keynes's work or the differences between Keynes and Hayek.This is the main problem with Desai's essay.The reader has no way of comparing the different positions of Keynes and Hayek because no yardstick is specified.This deficiency can be remedied by the use of the production possibilities frontier concept.There are two PPF's- the static and the dynamic.The static PPF assumes that the capital stock is held fixed in the short run and that in the short run there is no technological advance and/or innovation.Thus, the short run PPF can't shift.The long run PPF eliminates these assumptions ,it generally being the case that it is shifting outward over time asinvestment in improved kinds of capital goods reflects economic growth over time.Both kinds of PPF have an interior region and a boundary region.Only on the boundary  of the PPF's does the fact of resource scarcity constrain choice .A boundary position on either type of curve reflects the full employment of all resources available for use and allows for the existence of slack.Slack in the labor market would be given by the sum of frictional and voluntary unemployment.The existence of slack  capital goods would refer to machines and equipment undergoing maintenance,repair, retooling or upgrading.Assuming two basic kinds of goods,Keynes's consumption goods and investment goods,Pigou's wage goods and non wage goods,or Hayek's consumer goods and capital(producer)goods,an economy operating on the boundary would exhibit an inverse or negative relationship between both kinds of goods.An economy operating in the interior would exhibit a positive or direct relationship.Obviously,a general theory would have to deal with both cases.Thus,Keynes's theory emphasizes that the private sector by itself is usually operating in the interior of both PPF's .This is caused by the extreme difficulty of making correct intertemporal decisions ,made under conditions of uncertainty(partial knowledge or information or low weight of evidence or ambiguity,to use D. Ellsberg's term)or ignorance,about an optimal stock of capital(investment,nonwage) goods that is constantly subject to cyclical changes that are not periodic(an  irregular regularity, a la Schumpeter).These changes are induced by technological advances and innovations that cluster together(swarms,in Schumpeter's words).The expected ,future  rate(and total amount)of profit of using these capital goods is generated over time (and, at a point of time,a stock)by the sale of the consumption goods that were created with the use of the stock of capital goods combined with labor services.Involuntary unemployment ,for Keynes,is directly due to the aggregated \\"failure\\" of business,as a whole,to solve the intertemporal optimal capital stock allocation problem.Businessmen,in the face of the uncertainty and ignorance of the future,either decide not to invest in capital goods or to spaceout,cut back or slow down their investment expenditures.They decide to increase their liquidity as a way of insuring themselves against ignorance and/or uncertainty.I find the following quote of Steele to be unsupported.Supposedly,\\"...Keynes's knowledge of capital theory was'widely recognized' to be 'inadequate'...It was this alleged deficiency that caused Keynes(as part of his General Theory)to make investment depend primarily upon the demand for consumption goods.This was a crucial error\\".(Steele.p.238)There is no error here.The refutation given by Hayek,that a fall in the relative prices of consumer goods will increase the relative profitability of more capitalistic production methods(the Austrian capital theory concept of roundaboutness)holds only on the boundary of the dynamic PPF.It is now obvious that Keynes and Hayek are talking about different positions on the PPF.A careful examination of the collected works of both Keynes and Hayek shows that neither of them took the time to state to the other what their assumptions were.Hayek appears to mean the pure theory of capital assuming a boundary position.Keynes(see Steele,p.241),in his dismissal of Hayek's correct boundary analysis,is clearly dealing with applied theory.In the 1920's-1930's,due to the Great Depression,Keynes simply assumed that Hayek was presenting an argument about an economy operating in the interior of its PPF.Note that nowhere in all of the Hayek-Keynes correspondence did Hayek (or Keynes)write a simple note of explanation to the other scholar, using the literary equivalent of the standard PPF analysis,explaining explicitly what they were assuming.The comment of Chick and the reply of Steele demonstrate that they are talking past each other.Contrary toChick,Keynes's  general theory includes the Hayekian position as a special case if the economy is operating on the boundary.In fact,if sufficient public goods investment eliminates the sub optimal stock of capital goods  problem in the private sector and keeps the economy on boundary positions,Keynes's theory merges with Hayek's theory.Only in the interior does Keynes argue that investment is primarily a function of the EXPECTED(not actual) sales of consumer goods.On the boundary,an inverse relationship exists between consumer goods and capital goods.Investment would then be independent of actual consumer demand,but still be dependent on future,expected consumer demand.I recommend this book in its present form despite the fact that the reader will not be able to discern why the disagreements between Keynes and Hayek were never resolved unless he really understood his PPF analysis when he took his principles of economics courses.	2005-02-13

I have subtracted one star from my rating because of Maher's failure to consider the work of any logical probability theorist and another star for Maher's apparent inability,unexpected in the field of philosophy, to carefully and critically examine the Ramsey reviews.	2005-02-08

The controversies portion of the book primarily focuses on the Fisher-Jeffreys exchange,with Fisher being opposed to basing scientific statistical analysis on the need to specify the apriori distribution.Fisher, instead,favored a frequency analysis of the existing data to obtain operational probabilities and a hypothesis test based on significance levels and p-value tests. Jeffreys favored the standard Bayesian approach that required the specification of an a priori distribution that would be based on the existing initial data.Howie spends a moderate degree of time on the controversy between Fisher and Neyman(Pearson) over the logical meaning and operational nature of a confidence interval.This debate should have been won hands down by Fisher since the Neyman(Pearson)argument doesn't make any sense.Neyman was a strict frequentist whose claim that the interpretation of what a confidence interval meant was up to each individual researcher's belief directly contradicts his approach.The meaning of,say,a 95 % confidence interval for a sample mean  for a specific data subset can't be the frequentist claim that the researcher does a thought experiment in which he visualizes a 100 repetitions of the confidence level calculation in which 95 of the intervals contain that sample mean.Since only 1 calculation is in fact made,the probability of locating the sample statistic inside the confidence interval is either 0 or 1.This confusion of what a confidence interval means can still be found in quite a few statistics and econometrics books even today.Howie does a good job in discussing this controversy.I deducted one star from my rating because of the very poor coverage in section 4.6.3(pp.96-101;see also p.151) of the third controversy between John Maynard Keynes and Frank P Ramsey concerning Keynes's logical theory of probability and its operational capabilities.It is apparent that Howie has just accepted the conclusions of the two extremely poor book reviews made by Ramsey in 1922 and 1926 at face value.Howie accepts the unsupported claim , a claim that is generally accepted by the vast majority of philosophers and logicians in 2005,that Ramsey not only completely destoyed and devastated the logical structure of Keynes's theory and its operational applicability,but that Keynes himself accepted the critique of the boy genius and capitulated completely in the face of Ramsey's overwhelming argument.Based on his acceptance of the conventional wisdom,Howie claims that,a)Keynes accepted Ramsey's argument that all probabilities can be estimated by using precise single numbers,b)that Keynes claimed in the A Treatise on Probability(1921)that probabilities are often incalculable,c)that Keynes claimed that the ability to perceive the values of logical probabilities was intuitive.Nowhere in the A Treatise on Probability or in any book or paper published in his lifetime did Keynes EVER make any of these claims.In fact,all of these misstatements can be traced back to the wild and unsubstantiated claims of Ramsey that by the terms \\"nonnumerical\\"or\\"nonmeasurable\\"Keynes was arguing that the quantification and estimation of probabilities was ,in general ,not possible.Supposedly, all a decision maker could do,at best, was to partially ordinally rank some of the alternatives some of the time.All of these conclusions ,on the part of Ramsey and his adherents today, are false,since they are based on Ramsey's reviews,not of the entire A Treatise on Probability,but only of one chapter,chapter 3 of the TP,which is taken out of context.In chapters 15 and 17, Keynes develops and applies an interval valued approach to probability that Keynes makes the foundation of all of Part III of the TP.Thus, by \\"nonnumerical\\",Keynes meant that in general it took two numbers,not one,to estimate and quantify probabilities.These two numbers are composed of a lower bound(greatest lower bound)and an upper bound(least upper bound).Howie might consider writing another book on why the boy genius got it all wrong in this particular case .Especially interesting would be an examination  of the logical consistency of Ramsey's acceptance that \\"Ramsey numbers\\"were usually intervals,but probabilities could not be intervals.	2005-02-06

The use of it required clearcut empirical testing of the data before normality could be assumed.Finally,Keynes's analytic tool in the General Theory(1936) is to show that the general case in macroeconomics is the existence of multiple stable equiibria.This describes the commodity or output market.The labor market is a function of changes in the commodity market.The labor market is in a state of constant disequilibrium,equilibrium only possibly occurring in the special case of a global optimum being obtained in the commodity market.M is correct that the analysis in most markets should be based on excess demand functions.Keynes arrived at this approach in 1936.A set of D=Z functions(functions clearly defined by Keynes in the GT and analyzed by Keynes in chapters 20 and 21 of the GT) define a locus of points that Keynes called the AGGREGATE SUPPLY CURVE.Only one of these points gives a global optimum.The economics profession has made a bloody mess of Keynes's mathematical analysis since the publication  of the GT  in 1936,constantly confusing the expected aggregate supply function,Z,with the aggregate supply curve,D=Z.M's treatment of Keynes is deficient and needs to be fixed in a later edition.A complete mathematical analysis of Keynes's theory of effective demand is contained in Brady(2004),\\"Essays on JM Keynes and...\\"	2005-02-01

The book is important ,not for showing how econometrics historically developed into a scientific field  as it evolved from its earlier roots in the basically descriptive statistics  approach of Mitchell,but for demonstrating the mindless addiction to the use of the arithmetic mean,the least squares approach(ordinary least squares,generalized least squares, weighted least squares and other variates),the assumption of a normal probability distribution(or log normal,bivariate normal,joint normal and multivariate normal)and spectral analysis without ever attempting to first test to see if the actual data was normally distributed.Nowhere in any of these articles is the Chi-Square test for goodness of fit employed before the assumption of normality was made.Only the Marschak-Lange reply to J M Keynes(p.397) implicitly recognizes that Keynes was asking Tinbergen to supply a test to justify his assumption of normality BEFORE he assumed a normal probability distribution by using the Lexis Q-test(Marschak and Lange do not explicitly mention the Lexis Q-test but mention the Lexis approach as an earlier \\"analysis of variance\\"approach).Haavelmo's article(essay 39),first written in 1943,was titled,\\"The Probability Approach in Econometrics\\".A much more fitting title is \\"The Assumption of the Normal Probabiliity Approach in Econometrics without Testing for Normality\\".Haavelmo's article is supposed to beanother reply to the criticisms directed at Tinbergen by Keynes in the 1939-1940 exchange between them over the logical foundations of econometrics in the Economic Journal.Keynes had already answered  Tinbergen and Haavelmo in chapters 17(pp.205-214),29,30,32, and 33 of his 1921 A Treatise on Probability(TP).Keynes's major conclusion was that the normal distribution was a special distribution that had limited applicability.The real reason for the use and abuse of the normal distribution assumption was its simplicity,ease of use,and mathematical tractability.It allowed its user to appear to be scientific.Other statistical tools(mode,median,geometric mean,harmonic mean,range)should be considered.In chapters 29 and 30 of the TP, Keynes argues for the general use of Chebyshev's Inequality.The normal distribution is a special case that requires descriptive statistical evidence plus a TEST of the data to see if the data conform to normality.In chapters 32 and 33,Keynes devotes much analysis to the explicit use of the Lexis Q-test as a test for the legitimate(scientific)use of the normal distribution.This reviewer counts a total of two throw away references or comments about nonnormal distributions in the introduction and 45 essays.A field of study that makes no effort to test the data for normality and simply assumes a normal probability distribution is not only nonscientific,but is antiscientific .                                                         I have subtracted one star from my overall evaluation of this book due to the failure of Hendry and Morgan to deal objectively in their introduction with J M Keynes's correct assessment of the illogical  supporting foundation of econometrics as defended by Tinbergen,Haavelmo,and Koopmans.On pages 53-54,they list the tests that Tinbergen used(testing for linearity,serial correlation ,statistical significance,multicollinearity,coefficient of determination,sizes and signs of the regression coefficients,stability of regression coefficients,bunch maps,etc).There is no test for normality,which was Keynes's major point.On page 55,Hendry and Morgan claim that Keynes was ignorant of the literature,condescending,impolite and insulting in his comment and reply to Tinbergen,had not read Tinbergen's books,was trying to remove some of the potential luster from the rising star of econometrics,had been refuted by Hendry in 1993,etc.The facts are that both Hendry and Morgan are both completely ignorant of Keynes's full and complete critique that was made way back in 1921 in the TP.The 1939-1940 exchange is a mere footnote to the TP analysis. It is not Keynes who is the ignorant one.                                                             Keynes's critique of the logical foundations of econometrics,once understood,means that the entire toolkit that econometricians have been building up since the late 1910's is inappropriate for the study of business cycles.As Schumpeter said in 1912 in his The Theory of Economic Development,one can't use the normal distribution because of the regular irregularity of innovations that come in unpredictable bunches.It is new investment spending,based on future expected economic profits,on these innovations that is the primary variable driving the business cycle.                                                                  The objections made by Keynes to the misuse and abuse of the normal probability distribution in statistical business cycle modeling and testing are an earlier version of the massively,empirically supported objections made by Benoit Mandelbrot to the misuse and abuse of the normal probability distribution in finance,managerial finance and portfolio analysis in the second half of the 20th century.Mandelbrot,like Keynes before him,has faced furious resistance from the econometric profession.The following  statement by a highly respected econometrician,P H Cootner,commenting on the implications of Mandelbrot's scientific work  in the mid 1960's,explains why Keynes's correct argument of 1939-40 was also rejected:\\"If he(Mandelbrot)is right,almost all of our statistical tools are obsolete-least squares,spectral analysis,....established sample theory ,closed distributions.Almost without exception,past econometric work is meaningless\\".(Mandelbrot and Hudson,2004,The (Mis)Behavior of Markets,p.xxiii.Mandelbrot is right.	2005-01-30

Morgan covers the Tinbergen-Keynes debate on pages 121-134.There is no evidence in this book that Morgan ever read any part of Keynes's A Treatise on Probability(1921;TP),much less the crucial parts of the TP that would allow a reader of the 1939-1940 exchange to understand the full force of Keynes's critique(chapter 17,pp.205-214,chapters 29 and 30,chapter 32,pp.391-393, pp.397-398,especially Keynes's discussion on p.398 of using  the Lexis Q-test  to test for the stability of, and justification for assuming the use of, a normal probability distribution,chapter 33,pp.408-409,415-416,and 420-421,especially ft.1 on pp.420-421,which summarizes the conclusions one can expect to derive from an application of the Lexis-Q test).The logical core of Keynes's critique is contained on page 568 of the Sept.,1939 EJ.Keynes states:\\"...the most important condition is that the environment in all relevant respects,other than the fluctuations in those factors of which we take particular account,shuold be uniform and homogeneous over a period of time.\\"Keynes then suggests the formal procedure required to implement the application of the Lexis Q-test-breaking up the series(time series) into a set of subseries and then testing to see if each of the subseries' coefficients are generally the same(uniform) as the coefficients of the series.The results would be normal,subnormal,and supernormal(see Keynes's ft.1 on pp.420-421 of the TP).One criticism of Keynes(minor)is that he did not explicitly mention the Lexis Q-test.Keynes probably did not want to preclude other tests for normality,such as the Chi-Square.No where in Tinbergen's two volume work is there any such test.Keynes,however,could have told Tinbergen the results of such a test in advance.Due to constantly changing expectations of future expected profits and constant new investment in a capital stock changing due to constant technological change,advance and innovation over the long run period of time that would constitute the relevant time series,the necessary uniformity and homogeneity needed to apply a normal probability assumption would fail the test. The Keynes of the TP also had a suggested solution-use Cheybshev's inequality(see chapter 29 of the TP) and other measures of central tendency(law of errors) such as the median,harmonic mean and geometric mean(see chapter 17 of the TP).Morgan discusses the assumption of normality(see pp.8-9,60,113,117,240)that underlies the entire edifice of Tinbergen's econometrics without mentioning a single piece of empirical,experimental or historical evidence that would supply  some amount of justification for such an assumption.                                                                 In many respects,Keynes's argument against the misuse and abuse of the assumption of a normal probability distribution to test different theories of the business cycle ,using time series data, can be viewed as an earlier underdeveloped version of Benoit Mandelbrot's overwhelming critique of the misuse and abuse of the normal distribution in finance and portfolio theory.It is now obvious,due primarily to Mandelbrot's 50 years of scholarly work,that predictions  about future price movements in the stock,money,bond,commodity, and  currency exchange markets  are all wrong.It should not be surprising that attempts to predict changes in the business cycle over the 65 years since the Tinbergen-Keynes debate have also turned out to be badly off the mark.I recommend that a reader of Morgan's book also purchase Hugo Keuzenkamp's 2001 book,titled Probability,Econometrics and Truth and Benoit Mandelbrot's 2004 book,The (Mis) Behavior of Markets in order to fully grasp the case against present day econometric practice.Econometrics is presently reduced to the short run estimation of coefficients based on the use of cross-sectional data.	2005-01-27

Jaynes.On p.15,the following claim is made,based on Bunge(1988)-the logical theory has found no application in science or in technology.This is simply false.For instance,one need only read any of the papers and/or books of Jaynes,written over the last 50 years,whose latest book,Probability Theory:The Logic of Science,(2004),unfortunately published in incomplete form due to the death of the author,gives example after example of applications of a logical approach in science and technology,to see that H  and R have not done their homework.None of Jaynes's work is cited,discussed or mentioned in this book.The same conclusion holds with respect to the applied work done by Keynes,Jefferys,Carnap,and Johnson.Especially poor is this book's  treatment of the theoretical innovations made by John Maynard Keynes in the areas of probability theory,decision theory and statistics.Hamouda and Rowley make the following statements on p.15::...Good(I J Good) uses Koopman's notion of upper and lower bounds for probabilities to explain his own attempts to deal with nonmeasurability.\\" On p.118,they claim that\\"...unsure probabilities with interval-based...representations have been explained by Good,Smith,Dempster,Koopmans,Levi and others...\\".Hamouda and Rowley are ignorant of the fact that,alone among logical probability theorists,excepting the later work of H E Kyburg,the interval estimate approach to probability calculation was originally discovered and applied by Keynes in chapters 15 and 17 of the A Treatise on Probability(1921;TP).They discuss the contributions of Walley(1991) with respect to upper-lower probability bounds but ignore those of Keynes.The most likely answer that explains this lacuna is the all pervasive influence of two very poorly researched and written book reviews of the TP, made in 1922 and 1926,respectively ,by Frank P Ramsey.Ramsey concentrated his entire 1926 book review,titled\\"Truth and Probability\\",on a single chapter of the TP,chapter 3.This chapter contained Keynes's introductory analysis  and discussion of the problems of measuring and quantifying probabilities.Ramsey completely misinterpreted Keynes's meaning of the terms \\"nonnumerical\\" and \\"nonmeasurable\\" that are contained in the limited discussion of chapter 3.Ramsey simply assumed that Keynes was arguing that ,in general,probabilities could not be measured by the use of numbers.Contrary to Ramsey,Keynes's argument is that probabilities,in general,can't be measured by ONE number,but they can be measured by TWO numbers,i.e.,intervals.On at least 20 pages in this book,the discussion of interval estimates totally ignores the fact that Keynes is the founder and discoverer of the interval approach.Instead,H and R claim that Keynes's probabilities were \\"incomplete probabilities\\"(pp.6,74).This reviewer has no idea of what they are talking about.On pp.104-107 and pp.120-125,Hamouda and Rowley credit Ellsberg,Levi, and Gardenfors and Sahlin with discovering and analyzing the affect that ambiguity has in decision making.Again, Keynes's introductory comments in chapter 6 of the TP are mentioned,but the analysis by Keynes in chapter 26 is overlooked.Keynes,not Ellsberg,was the first to define a variable,w,where w is defined to be the weight of the evidence,to measure the relative completeness of the total amount of the relevant potential and actual evidence upon which an estimate of probability would be based by a decision maker.Keynes defined w to be an element of the unit interval [0,1],0<=w<=1.This definition is practically the same as Ellsberg's rho variable,which measures the \\"ambiguity\\" of the data and knowledge base available to a decision maker to form an estimate of a probability,which will usually turn out to be an interval,a la Keynes.Keynes's discovery of a decision theoretic rule,his conventional coefficient of weight and risk,c=p/(1+q)[2w/(1+w)],incorporates solutions,not only to the Ellsberg paradox,but to the Allais paradox and the certainty,reflection,translation and preference reversal anomalies discussed by psychologists as well.Given that A is defined to be an outcome,the decision maker seeks to maximize cA,instead of pA,the expected value rule or pU(A),the expected utility rule, where p is a probability(p+q=1)and U is a differentiable utility function.Instead of this book,I recommend Benoit Mandelbrot's 2004 book,\\"The (Mis)Behavior of Markets\\" or Hugo Keuzenkamp's 2001 book,\\"Probability ,Econometrics and Truth\\"or the book by Jaynes mentioned above.	2005-01-24

Ramsey: Philosophical Papers	Books	4	6	9	N	N	Ramsey's "Truth and Probability"essay needs to be corrected	This book is another collection of essays written by F P Ramsey between 1922 and 1929.These essays cover practically all  of Ramsey's important contributions to philosophy,logic,universals,pragmatism,mathematics,probability(subjective probability) and decision theory.I recommend the purchase of this volume for the reader who does not yet own any of the earlier published collections of Ramsey's papers.Unfortunately,there are major errors present in essay four,titled\\"Truth and Probability\\".These errors have never been corrected and essentially are passed down from one generation of philosophers ,economists and decision theorists to the next.Ramsey's fundamental error is his misinterpretation of the words J M Keynes used to describe his interval estimate approach to probability in chapter 3 of the A Treatise on Probability in 1921.Keynes used the terms \\"nonnumerical \\" and \\"nonmeasurable\\" to describe  the numerical approximation  of probabilities( indeterminate probabilities)by means of two numbers,a lower bound and an upper bound.In Keynes's general theory of probability,only a partial ordering is possible.There is no sigma algebra or measure defined on the real numbers between( and including) 0 and 1 so that all conjunctions and disjunctions(unions and intersections) of probabilities, using addition and multiplication operations,results in a unique single number answer.If a complete order can be specified,then Keynes's logical approach to probability will simplify to the special case given by assuming a complete ordering of the probability space.Keynes gave his most general axiomatic presentation on pp.135-138 of the TP;it develops a set theoretic analysis that holds for both unique probabilities as well as intervals.Keynes gave additional axioms that would allow the special cases of statistical frequences and unique numerical probabilities to be calculated in chapters 8(29-31)and 15 of the TP.Unfortunately,Ramsey decided that Keynes was arguing that probabilities ,in general, could not be calculated using numbers at all ,except in the special case of the Principle of Indifference .Similarly,Ramsey came to another strange conclusion-that Keynes was opposed to the idea of basing estimates of probabilities on frequency data.These false and misleading claims by Ramsey simply mean that he had no idea of the generality of Keynes's approach.Ramsey also failed to realize that his approach to probability is in fact a very special case of Keynes's general theory of probability. The same conclusion holds with respect to  Ramsey's decision theoretic approach -it is a special case of Keynes's general approach,which applies to all areas of human decision making and probability estimation,such as everyday practical decision making,social science,liberal arts,economics and business,education,and not just to \\"...Gibbs phase space...\\".                                                               Another reoccurring problem ,in this book as well as in all other books containing collections of Ramsey's papers,is the inaccurate and misleading introduction provided by the editor of this volume,D. H. Mellor.Mellor makes  two unsubstantiated claims.First,Mellor claims that\\"...in his 1922 Review of the Treatise,and in his 1926 paper,\\"Truth and Probability\\",Ramsey criticised the idea of partial entailment...so effectively that Keynes himself abandoned it;...(Mellor,p.xiv)\\".With the exception of some areas of physics,engineering,chemistry,and biology,partial ordering is simply a fact.Nowhere in any of Keynes's published works does Keynes ever state that a complete ordering of probability space is the general case.Second,Mellor claims that\\"The fact that Keynes did not resent Ramsey's demolition of his Theory of Probability is shown by his getting Ramsey a Fellowship at King's College Cambridge in 1924 at the ripe age of 21...\\"(Mellor,p.xv).This claim makes no sense at all,since Ramsey fails to present a formal deductive argument with clearly specified premises and a conclusion that follows from them.Ramsey's major \\"arguments\\"  are the informal fallacies of appeal to authority and argument from ignorance.No where in any of Mellor's publications has he ever shown that Keynes would substitute Ramsey's very special theory for his own general theory.Lastly,the claim made on the back jacket cover of the book that Ramsey was the greatest Cambridge philosopher of all time is highly questionable,since  Bertrand Russell is usually considered to be  the greatest.	2005-01-17

President Johnson agreed.This won the day for McNamara and the Bundy brothers to apply their academic(economics and political science) game theory approach,which called for a series of bombing escalation campaigns(to impose a cost for not negotiating to end the war)and deescalations(a benefit or reward for negotiating an end to the war).Based on the assumption that the North Vietnamese were rational utility maximizers,they would supposedly negotiate an end to the war.Johnson had a good chance of ending the war in early to mid 1965.Instead,he took the policy advice of academics as opposed to the expert(in this case) advice of LeMay.The result was that the war lasted another 10 years.President Johnson needed to emulate President Lincoln's approach during the American Civil War-do whatever it takes to win the war as soon as possible.War is hell,so get it over with.	2004-12-31

Kyburg presents an improved version of the diagram  that Keynes provided the readers of the A Treatise on Probability(1921,TP),chapter 3,p.39 that illustrates Keynes's introductory comments on his interval estimate approach to probability.Keynes called his interval estimates \\"nonnumerical probabilities\\" and \\"nonmeasurable probabilities\\".Kyburg had the chance to set the record straight by correcting the foolish and silly( gross )misinterpretation of Keynes's approach made in two error filled book reviews by F P Ramsey,in 1922 and 1926,that claimed that Keynes's approach did not make use of any numbers.Supposedly,the best a decision maker could do ,in general,was to specify a weak ordinal ranking some of the time.Kyburg does nothing to set the record straight.Kyburg appears to be completely ignorant of the interval valued approach that Keynes constructed in chapter 15,pp.160-163 and in chapter 17,pp.186-194 of the TP.Keynes makes this approach the foundation for his technical analysis of analogy and induction in chapters 20 and 22 by means of his concept of a \\"finite\\"probability.The comment by Runde was Runde's chance to set the record straight.Unfortunately,like Kyburg,Runde is simply ignorant of the major breakthroughs made by Keynes in chapters 15,17,20, and 22 of the TP.The contribution of Seidenfeld and comment by Lilly add nothing new to our understanding ofthe approach taken by Keynes to probability,induction and analogy in the TP.The other problem in this book is the contribution of K Pearce and K Hoover ,as well as the comment by A Cottrell, on Keynes's D-Z model of his theory of effective demand,which Keynes introduced in a brief outline form in chapter 3 of the General Theory and presented in a fully developed fashion in chapters 20 and 21 of the GT.We learn from these authors that economists ,some 60 years after the publication of the GT,still can't figure out the mathematical specification of Keynes's expected aggregate supply function,Z.Any reader of this review,economists included, who knows how to integrate(take the antiderivative)need only turn to either pp.55-56,ft.2 or pp.282-285 of the GT and integrate Keynes's derivatives.It is a simple task to discover that Z=P+wN,where P=expected future profits,w equals the money wage,and N =aggregate employment.The incoherent and erroneous position of economists,with respect to the technical specification of Keynes's aggregate supply function,Z,can be traced back to an error filled paper ,published in 1955 by Dennis Robertson,with a mathematical appendix ,also error filled,by Harry Johnson,in the Economic Journal.It was Robertson who started the myth that pp.24-30 of the GT contained the technical analysis of the core of Keynes's theory of effective demand.Pearce,Hoover,and Cottrell merely pass the errors on to a future generation of economists.	2004-12-29

Assuming that Say's Law holds,set the elasticity at the bottom of p.116  of the GT equal to the elasticity at the bottom of p.283 of the GT.The following result is obtained:w/p=mpl/(mpc+mpi),where w/p equals the expected real wage and mpl equals the marginal product of labor.If,and only if,mpc+mpi=1 will the classical and neoclassical labor market clearing equilibrium condition ,needed to obtain an optimal result,occur.There will be noinvoluntary unemployment,only voluntary and frictional unemployment.If mpc+mpi is < 1,involuntary unemployment will occur since as (mpc+mpi) falls,the ratio on the RHS will rise.To maintain the equality requires that the money wage rises or that the money wage rises by more than the price level.The LHS ratio must rise.This simply means that labor as a whole can do nothing in this situation to LOWER the money wage ,since this would violate the necessary first order condition for optimality THAT THE W/P=MPL.Obviously,government(public)goods,export goods,and import goods can be divided into consumption and investment goods,in which case Keynes's general optimality condition does not need to be expanded.It can ,of course ,be expanded in the following way.Let mpg,mpe,and mpm equal the marginal propensities to spend on public goods,exports,and imports.Keynes's general theory would then be summarized and read as  follows:w/p=mpl/(mpc+mpi+mpg+mpe-mpm).Unless mpc +mpi+mpg+mpe-mpm=1,involuntary unemployment will occur.Finally,the strange objections made by Richard Kahn and Joan and Austin Robinson that Keynes ignored imperfect competition are easily met by multiplying the LHS(w/p) by the elasticity 1-[1/(Es)]and the RHS by the elasticity 1+[1/Ed].Until Lawson and/or his fellow critical realists deal correctly with Keynes's philosophy,approach to probability ,  and his general theory of employment, important side issues, like the proper role that methodological considerations should play in economics if it is to become a science,the misuse of econometrics(addiction to the normal probability distribution),the relative importance of a particular set of evolving labor ,political,social,financial and economic institutions over time,etc., will offer no challenge to the reigning neoclassical school at all.	2004-12-28

Ramsey, in 1922 and 1926, in two error filled reviews  of Keynes's book that Bertrand Russell correctly described as having the least value of any paper written by Ramsey during his brief lifetime(1903-1930).In chapter 3 of the TP,p.37,Keynes warns the reader that his approach to the measurement and quantification of estimating probabilities would not be completed until after Part II of the TP had been finished.In chapter 15(pp.160-163) and chapter 17(p.186-194)of his TP,Keynes makes it crystal clear that by the terms \\"nonnumerical\\" and \\"nonmeasurable\\" he means not by a single numeral(number)but by TWO numerals.Keynes is the founder of the interval approach to probability.This is directly contrary to Runde's claim that Keynes's theory is strictly a qualitative (comparative)approach involving the use of ordinal rankings,combined with some very special cases of numerical measurement involving frequencies and applications of  Keynes's principle of indifference.This would make Keynes's theory inoperative in the real world of actual decision making.Fortunately,Ramsey and Runde are wrong.For Keynes,it is the intervals themselves,if they overlap in any way, which are incomparable,nonrankable,and incommensurable.A simple example is to take the two probability interval estimates [.3,.5] and [.4,.6].These two probabilities can't be ranked or compared.They are \\"nonnumerical\\" probabilities.Runde wastes the reader's time by presenting diagrams purporting to represent intervals without the use of any numbers. This conception has absolutely nothing to do with the approach to probability estimation presented in 1921 by Keynes in his TP.We can now summarise Keynes's approach. All probabilities are either point estimates ,involving single numbers, or they are interval estimates, involving two numbers.These latter proabilities can be called nonadditive,imprecise or indeterminate probabilities,as long as the Bayesian interpretation of imprecise is not imputed to Keynes.In chapter 26 of the TP,Keynes incorporated his interval estimate approach into a method for technically dealing with expectations and decision theory.Keynes presented his conventional coefficient of risk and weight,c.The goal of the decision maker is to maximize cA,as opposed to pA,expected value or pU(A),expected utility.c=p(1/(1+q)[2w/(1+w)].Both c and w,which measures the completeness of the potential and actual amount of relevant evidence upon which the decision maker will base his calculation of an estimated probability,are normalized on the unit interval [0,1].Naturally,one will obtain a lower bound and an upper bound when using the c coefficient formula.This would then lead to a \\"nonnumerical\\" weighted value and/or \\"nonnumerical\\" mathematical expectation or expected value.All of this ,however,is omitted in both Ramsey and Runde.The lesson to be learned is that papers should be carefully examined for errors by editors before they are accepted for publication.The only possible reason for purchasing this book would be if a potential reader wanted to compare the original 1995  Runde article with Runde's 2001 contribution in this volume and see if any learning from experience has occurred.My own opinion is that the reader would bebetter off just reading chapters 15 and 17 of the TP.better off just reading chapters 15 and 17 of the TP.	2004-12-25

Wells is practically the only post keynesian to have gotten much of Keynes's theory of effective demand down correctly.Wells had long recognized that Keynes's expected aggregate demand curve had to be specified as D=D1+D2=f(N)=pO and that it was not correct to specify the expected aggregate supply function ,Z ,as being equal to pO,as claimed by Dennis Robertson,Harry Johnson,Sydney Weintraub,E. Roy Weintraub,Paul Davidson,Douglas Vickers,Jan Kregel,etc.Unfortunately,Wells was never able to specify the expected aggregate supply function correctly as Z=g(N)=P+wN,where P is equal to expected future profits,w is equal to the money wage,and N equals aggregate employment.Wells kept confusing the aggregate supply curve,a locus of all D=Z points of intersection,which he,alone among post keynesians,correctly derived, with the aggregate supply function,which is a linear straight line in both the case of decreasing returns to labor and the case of constant returns to labor.Wells was the only post keynesian to take chapter 20 of the General Theory seriously.This book needs to be read at the same time that a reader is also covering Wells'1961 Economic Journal article and his 1974 History of Political Economy article.Close,but no cigar is how one could categorize Wells' contribution.	2004-12-25

Dasgupta and essay number 8,written by M.Morgan.On pp.74-76,the reader is informed that Keynes had no mathematical model that analyzed the role played by involuntary unemployment in his theory of effective demand.On pp.187-195,which covers section 3,titled\\"Modeling Keynes's General Theory\\",the reader is told that Keynes had no model of his general theory in the GT.Morgan starts out as if she intends to cover Meade's 1937 model which is in fact very similar to the model presented by Keynes in chapters 10,20 and 21 of the GT,the major differences being (1)that Keynes did not include a variable to represent interest rates and (2)that Keynes incorporates expectational effects by shifting curves while Meade incorporates expectational effects by changing the elasticity(shapes) of the curves themselves.Meade's paper derives results which are very close to the results derived by Keynes,i.e.,an unemployment equilibrium representing the amount of involuntary unemployment qualitatively in a formal mathematical model.Keynes's comment on Meade's paper was that there was nothing with which he disagreed.Morgan NEVER attempts to analyze either Meade's model or Meade's results.Instead,she starts talking about the basic assumptions of Meade's model,which are the standard assumptions of the perfect/pure competition model.Meade left out the word \\"pure\\" and wrote \\"perfect\\" only.However,this is of no major consequence as far as the mathematical modeling of either Keynes or Meade was concerned.The results of Morgan's paper are incoherent.There is a very simple way ,for either P.Dasgupta or M.Morgan ,to obtain the original mathematical model of the general theory presented by Keynes in the GT.The reader of the GT needs to be able to integrate(take the antiderivative of) the derivatives that Keynes presented in his formal analysis on pp.55-56,ft.2,pp.280-286,pp.304-306 and pp.271-278.These last mentioned pages refer to Keynes 's explicit discussion of the mathematical differences that existed between his model and the mathematical model of A.C. Pigou,presented in chapters 8-10 of PartII of The Theory of Unemployment(1933).To understand this comparison-contrast,the reader would have had to have already covered these chapters from Pigou's book.The following results can be easily duplicated by any reader or economist who understands differentiation and integration.Keynes's model consists of three functions.The expected aggregate demand function is D =D1+D2=f(N)=pO,where p is an expected price level and O,real output, is a function of N.The expected aggregate supply function is Z= Z1+Z2=g(N)=P+wN,where P is the expected profit,w is the money wage and N represents aggregate employment.The actual or current aggregate demand function is Y =Y(N)=C+I=PO,where C=bY (or C= a+bY)and P denotes the actual price level.(See p.209 of the GT).Solving this system of equations on the assumption that Say's Law holds yields the following solution:w/p= MPL/(MPC +MPI),where MPL equals the marginal product of labor,MPC equals tne marginal propensity to spend on consumption goods,C,and MPI equals the marginal propensity to spend on investment goods,I.The special classical and neoclassical theories(monetarism,supply side,rational expectations,real business cycle,etc.)all require that MPC+MPI=1.This gives the special result that w/p=MPL,where w/p equals the real wage.This condition,which represents the optimality condition for labor market clearing(NO INVOLUNTARY UNEMPLOYMENT)in all classical and neoclassical theories, is identical to the statement thar the macroeconomy is operating on the boundaries of BOTH the dynamic and the static production possibilities frontiers(PPF's).The reader should note that Keynes's general theory of employment is easily generalized to include a government sector,import sector,and export sector.Letting MPG,MPE,and MPM represent the marginal propensities for government spending(public goods),exports,and imports,we obtain w/p=MPL/(MPC+MPI+MPG+MPE-MPM).s).The reader should note that Keynes's general theory of employment is easily generalized to include a government sector,import sector,and export sector.Letting MPG,MPE,and MPM represent the marginal propensities for government spending(public goods),exports,and imports,we obtain w/p=MPL/(MPC+MPI+MPG+MPE-MPM).	2004-12-25

Jaynes has done a brilliant job of constructing a logical framework for incorporating  and explicating the crucial differences between causal(physical)independence and logical(epistemological)independence that will enter into the assumptions underlying applications of the probability calculus(statistical inference)to scientific analysis in physical science(physics,engineering,chemistry,biology,etc.).Jaynes shows repeatedly how one goes about applying maximum entropy and/or Shannon's information approach to a host of problems in the physical sciences.Jaynes also incorporates  valuable historical commentary on a host of individuals,from Laplace and Boole to Keynes,Ramsey,Fisher,Neyman and Pearson,Jeffreys,Savage,etc.For instance,on pp.564-65,he corrects the mythology and misdirected criticism directed at Laplace's calculation of the probability that the sun will rise tomorrow,given that it has already risen a certain number of times before,using the rule of succession.Laplace made it clear that he was not using any of the extensive ,relevant background knowledge ,available a priori, in his calculations.Thus,relative to the evidence specified only,there is nothing incorrect about the answer arrived at by Laplace.Jaynes,however, needed to add some chapters that would deal explicitly with social science and liberal arts,as well as disciplines like education,educational psychology,economics and business.I will spend the rest of the review commenting on the broader aspects of the work of John Maynard Keynes and Benoit Mandelbrot that Jaynes has appeared to have overlooked.First,Keynes intended that his interval estimate approach to probability,based on partial orders that do not satisfy the assumption of a sigma algebra,was applicable to all areas of life.Thus,Keynes obtains a general theory that is applicable everywhere.Nothing written by Keynes in the A Treatise on  Probability(1921) contradicts the work of Jeffreys or Jaynes since the specific areas of science that Jeffreys and Jaynes seek to apply a logical approach to probability to satisfy the conditions need to specify a continuous mapping of the real numbers into each other.Single number probabilities under such a mapping require that a sigma algebra be specified in order to calculate the appropriate sums of unions and intersections.The basic data of physical and life science(molecules,cells,genes,chromosomes,atomic and subatomic partcles,electrons,etc.)is generally independent ,homogeneous, and invariant through time.When one turns to the other fields mentioned above,this is not the case.Keynes complemented his interval approximation approach to decision making by systematically constucting a conventional coefficient of risk and weight,c, that is able to deal with the nonlinear types of effects generated by the type of data available in the social sciences.Keynes's c coefficient equals p/(1+q)[2w/(1+w)].Define A to be an outcome.The decision maker maximizes cA,as opposed to the expected value rule,maximize pA or the expected utility rule,maximize pU(A),where U is a utility function and p is a probability(p+q=1).w represents the weight of the evidence.It measures the completeness of the actual and potential available ,relevant evidence upon which an estimate of probability will be based.It is an index that is normalized on the unit interval,0<=w<=1.Keynes's approach explains and gives solutions for all of the socalled paradoxes of decision theory.I now turn to the theoretical and empirical work of Benoit Mandelbrot.Based on a massive amount of data analysis from a number of different countries drawn from a number of different financial markets(cotton,commodity,stock,money,currency,bond),Mandelbrot has shown empirically that price movements in these markets demonstrate both long and short run dependence and discontinuity over time.Mandelbrot has incorporated variables representing these effects along with variables representing skewness and kurtosis into a generalized modelthat simplifies under special conditions to the normal distribution .Unfortunately,it is the normal probability distribution(and its relatives,the t,F,and chi square)that is used practically everywhere in the social sciences.Jaynes discussion of turbulence effects in his two page discourse on economics(7.21,pp.233-234)is suggestive that he also is somewhat  aware that a different approach to analyzing social data that is nonhomogeneous and subject to abrupt and discontinuous change over time is needed in the social sciences.	2004-12-22

Keynes	Books	1	1	1	N	N	Keynes' theory of probability is based on interval estimates	The editors , and the authors of the essays in this book of collected essays ,fail to give an accurate representation of Keynes's philosopical,logical,and economic views because they are fundamentally in error as regards to  the basic nature of Keynesian probability in Keynes's logical theory of probability as outlined by Keynes in 1921 in his path breaking work,A Treatise on Probability(TP).These errors are precisely the same  errors that were made by Frank Ramsey in two very poor book reviews of Keynes's TP ,published respectively in 1922 and 1926.Ramsey incorrectly claimed that Keynes had defined the terms \\"nonmeasurable\\" and\\"nonnumerical\\" to mean that numbers could not be used in the measurement of probabilities except in  cases where the principle of indifference could be applied.Nowhere in chapter 3 of the TP or anywhere else in any of his published works does Keynes ever make such a claim .How Ramsey came to this conclusion is not clear.It appears that he simply read his own interpretation into chapter 3 of the TP.On p.37 of chapter 3 ,Keynes warned the reader that no conclusions could be drawn  about his preliminary discussions of the measurement of probabilities in chapter 3 until Part II of the TP had been covered.In chapter 15 of the TP,Keynes defines the terms explicitly:\\"Many probabilities,which are incapable of numerical measurement,can be placed nevertheless BETWEEN(Keynes's emphasis)numerical limits.And by taking particular non-numerical probabilities as standards a great number of comparisons or approximate measurements become possible.If we can place a probability in an order of magnitude with some standard probability,we can obtain its approximate measure by comparison\\".(Keynes,1921,p.160).Keynes then proceeds to base all of Part III of the TP on his discussions of a modified version of one of Boole's problems, taken from Boole's 1854 book,The Laws of Thought,and analyzed by Keynes in chapter 17 of the TP.In chapters 15 and 17 of the TP,Keynes adapts Boole's approach into a systematic method for the calculation of interval estimates or approximate measures.In chapter 12, Keynes develops a axiomatic framework that applies to both exact numerical probabilities and inexact nonnumerical interval estimate probabilities.None of the essay writers in this book is able to show HOW Keynes's approach can be operationalized.Keynes is presumed to be an advocate of a very weak ordinalist approach that essentially is a caricature of the systematic exposition contained in Part II of the TP.Even this ordinalist approach,it is argued,can only be used in certain circumstances.The upshot is that the potential bookbuyer would be better off if he/she simply bought a copy of the A Treatise on Probability(1921).	2004-12-09

The confusions of Friedman,Tobin, and Davidson all show up simultaneously in their  attempted  discussion of the technical details of Keynes's Theory of Effective Demand as modeled by Keynes in chapter 20 of the General Theory.Chapter 20,and the additional analysis contained in chapter 21 of the General Theory,contains the analytic core of Keynes's major innovation in the General Theory,his incorporation of expectations and uncertainty into the microfoundations of entreprenuerial decision making and the subsequent aggregation of this micro model into the  macroscopic D-Z model,which Keynes had briefly introduced in a beginning chapter of the General Theory,titled\\"The Principle of Effective Demand\\".It is clear from a reading of pages 143-157 that  Tobin,Friedman,and Davidson do not understand how to derive Keynes's original D-Z model.Simple integration of Keynes's derivatives ,either on pp.55-56,ft.2 or on pp.282-285 of the General Theory ,would reveal that D=pO and that Z=P+wN.Friedman fails to realize that the p in D=pO IS DEFINED BY KEYNES AS AN EXPECTED PRICE. Another error committed by Friedman is his failure to recognize that the mathematical expression p=[D/W.W]/O IS EQUAL TO EXPECTED MARGINAL COST.Practically all of Friedman's footnote 15 on pp.156-157 of this book is erroneous.None of these erroneous results were challenged by either Tobin or Davidson.Keynes's Z FUNCTION IS COMPLETELY ELIMINATED IN FRIEDMAN'S ANALYSIS.Despite the large number of errors,this reviewer recommends that this book be purchased.A study of these errors is very instructive.Davidson do not understand how to derive Keynes's original D-Z model.Simple integration of Keynes's derivatives ,either on pp.55-56,ft.2 or on pp.282-285 of the General Theory ,would reveal that D=pO and that Z=P+wN.Friedman fails to realize that the p in D=pO IS DEFINED BY KEYNES AS AN EXPECTED PRICE.

Shackle	Books	3	3	5	N	N	Shackle's theory is a  special case of Keynes's approach	Shackle's approach to decision making,time,expectations,choice and uncertainty in all of the books and journal articles he published in his lifetime boils down to the following ambiguous and problematic argument:Knowledge is certainty.This is because knowledge consists of facts.Facts have a true objective reality.Unknowledge is uncertainty.Since &#34;un&#34; translates as no,no knowledge means no certainty.No knowledge means we are ignorant.We do not know.The conclusion Shackle reaches is that there are only two possible states of knowledge in which choices are made . The first state is the state of complete knowledge.The second is the state of complete unknowledge(ignorance).We know nothing about the future.Thus,decision making about future events must always be undertaken under uncertainty.Moreover,this uncertainty is total and complete ignorance.  This reviewer considers  Shackle's basic argument to be seriously flawed,since it conflates certainty with knowledge.More importantly,it directly conflicts with the concept of knowledge as viewed from a scientific perspective.The scientific perspective is that knowledge is not merely factual and deductive,but is also inductive,experimental ,statistical,probabilistic and experiential. However,I do highly recommend this book for readers who are convinced by Shackle's argument.Shackle builds an impressive superstructure upon his weak foundation.It is possible to take Shackle's potential surprise approach to decision making ,amend it and then apply it in ways that Shackle himself would not approve of.The major objection to Shackle is his unsupported claim that John Maynard Keynes held the same general viewpoint regarding uncertainty as Shackle did.In fact,Shackle's approach is a special case of Keynes's general theory of decision making under uncertainty and risk first put forth in 1921 in his A Treatise on Probability in chapters 6 and 26.Keynes defines w ,the weight of the evidence ,as 0&#60;=w&#60;=1.Keynes has specified an index to measure w,where w measures the completeness of the relevant actual and potential available evidence upon which to estimate a probability.Most such probability estimates would be interval estimates for Keynes.Keynes's interval valued approach to probability  was completely and totally overlooked by Shackle and all other Post Keynesians,such as Paul Davidson,Jan Kregel,Douglas Vickers,etc.The cases that Shackle and Davidson base their theories on are the case of ignorance,where w=0,and the case of complete evidence,where w=1.The important case for Keynes,outside of the case of investment in new types of capital goods where w=0,is where 0&#60;w&#60;1.Shackle(and Davidson)reject this and hence can't be considered to be Keynesian.In the General Theory,Keynes defines uncertainty to be a decreasing function of weight .Letting u equal uncertainty ,u=f(w).Keynes then defines liquidity preference to be an increasing function of uncertainty.Letting lp equal liquidity preference,lp=g(u).Thus,lp is a decreasing function of the weight of the evidence.Keynes's discussion of these points on pp.239-241 of the General Theory mean that Post Keynesianism is just another special theory like neoclassical economics,which assumes that w=1,so that all decisions are risky,but not uncertain, and that a normal probability distribution can always be applied.an index to measure w,where w measures the completeness of the relevant actual and potential available evidence upon which to estimate a probability.Most such probability estimates would be interval estimates for Keynes.Keynes's interval valued approach to probability  was completely and totally overlooked by Shackle and all other Post Keynesians,such as Paul Davidson,Jan Kregel,Douglas Vickers,etc.The cases that Shackle and Davidson base their theories on are the case of ignorance,where w=0,and the case of complete evidence,where w=1.The important case for Keynes,outside of the case of investment in new types of capital goods where w=0,is where 0&#60;w&#60;1.Shackle(and Davidson)reject this and hence can't be considered to be Keynesian.In the General Theory,Keynes defines uncertainty to be a decreasing function of weight .Letting u equal uncertainty ,u=f(w).Keynes then defines liquidity preference to be an increasing function of uncertainty.Letting lp equal liquidity preference,lp=g(u).Thus,lp is a decreasing function of the weight of the evidence.Keynes's discussion of these points on pp.239-241 of the General Theory mean that Post Keynesianism is just another special theory like neoclassical economics,which assumes that w=1,so that all decisions are risky,but not uncertain, and that a normal probability distribution can always be applied.	2004-11-22

This is another in a series of books written by Benoit Mandelbrot that deserves to have a 6 star rating.The current foundation of practically all financial analyses ,excepting the \\"safety-first\\"approach of Roy and Charnes and Cooper,is the mean-variance(standard deviation)approach which is incorporated into more advanced versions such as the capital asset pricing model(capm)and the Black-Scholes options pricing model for puts and calls.All of these models assume that all price movements in all financial markets are approximately the same small size,are independent of each other,are homogeneous and satisfy the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem.This leads directly to the assumption that all price movements can be modeled as(as if)being normally distributed.The reader should note that practically all classical and neoclassical economic theory is currently based on subjective expected utility(SEU)theory which bases much of its practical results on the applicability of the normal probability distribution.The entire argument made by Milton Friedman and Robert Lucas,jr.,that all false trading(contracting)at disequilibrium(nonequilibrium)prices cancels out in the long run over time ,is based on the claim that such price movements are normally distributed around the market clearing equilibrium price.This equilibrium market clearing price is automatically interpreted as being the mean of a normal probability distributiion.Such a price is thus an optimal price since the average of a normal probability distribution is also the maximum outcome possible.The entire claim that price adjustments  lead to an optimal outcome in all(private sector) markets means that the socalled\\"INVISIBLE HAND\\"of the market is nothing more than a normal probability distribution.Any type of skewed and/or nonnormal distribution of price movements means automatically that such adjustments do not lead to an optimal outcome.Mandelbrot has thrown down the gauntlet,not only to the current purveyors of basic risk management,portfolio analysis,but to much of the economics profession as well.Mandelbrot does this by simply presenting massive amounts of empirical evidence showing that the commodity,futures,money,stock,and other markets price movements are not generally normally distributed.All of Mandelbrot's research has been replicated and duplicated by many other researchers in many other countries besides the USA.Since the mid-fifties,Mandelbrot has carefully and patiently presented his results in a series of widely cited scholarly articles and books.In this book,Mandelbrot has decided to take his case directly to the general public.The book is straightforward and easy to read and absorb.The only technical knowledge needed by a reader is some basic familiarity with the  normal distribution and an understanding of the basics of calculating a Z-score.I can't recommend this book too highly.	2004-11-20

Two expectations,a lower bound and an upper bound,would be required.Keynes supports the use of \\"inexact numerical approximation\\"(Keynes's own description of his approach made in chapter 15 of the TP)and not the use of exact,precise,definite single number answers which usually turn out,in economics and business analysis,to be exactly,precisely and definitely wrong.	2004-11-16

Ramsey based his entire assessment of chapter 3 of the TP on a misinterpretation of the words \\"nonnumerical\\" and \\"nonmeasurable\\". Ramsey misinterpreted these words to mean that Keynes was arguing that in general it was not possible to use numbers(numerals)to specify or quantify a probability relation or degree of belief.Ramsey concluded that Keynesian nonnumerical probabilities were \\"mysterious\\" entities that did not obey the laws of probability.Ramsey got it all wrong.Contrary to Ramsey,Keynesian probabilities are,in general,interval estimates.Each interval is specified by a lower bound or limit and an upper bound or limit.  Keynes's definition of \\"nonnumerical\\"is straightforward.Probabilities are nonnumerical because they can't,in general,be quantified by a single numeral.\\"Nonnumerical\\" translates as \\"not by a numeral,but by two numerals\\".Of course,interval estimates create  problems of noncomparability,nonrankability,and incommensurability.Keynes is the founder of the interval estimate school of applied probability.Unfortunately,not a single economist ,who contributed to this collection of essays, has the slightest idea about what a Keynesian probability is ,since they all accept the Ramsey argument.This leaves economists only one option if they want to operationalize Keynes's theory.Economists thus conclude that since probabilities can't be quantified,in general,in Keynes's approach ,Keynes must have meant that probabilities can sometimes be ordinally ranked.Under this Ramseyian interpretation,a decision maker can say some of the time that one probability is either greater than or lesser than another probability.However,no numbers can be used,in general.Keynes's point,that it takes two numbers to estimate a probability,has been completely overlooked by every single author in this book.	2004-11-13

It is a simple matter to demonstrate that economics is not presently a mathematical science,unless Weintraub's study refers to the fact that economists spend all their time trying to reinterpret, and apply in an ad hoc fashion  to economics ,the original mathematical analysis of physicists,chemists,biologists and engineers.Consider the case of the differential calculus analysis presented by Keynes in the General Theory(GT).Keynes's analysis of his D-Z model is presented on pp.55-56,ft.2,pp.280-286,pp.304-306,and on pp.271-278,although this latter analysis would require that the reader of the GT already be familiar with A C Pigou's model as contained in Part II of The Theory of Unemployment(1933)in chapters 8-10.Keynes's analysis of his Y-multiplier model is contained on pp.114-117,126,and p.209 of the GT.Any reader of this review who has taken and presumably passed a lower division course in the first semester of calculus and analytic geometry can obtain Keynes's original models simply by integrating (taking the anti derivative of)Keynes's differential analysis as listed  on the pages mentioned above.This has not been done by a single economist since the publication of the GT in 1936.Instead,there has been a 68 year period of\\"What did Keynes mean?\\"articles and books.Both E Roy Weintraub and his father,Sydney Weintraub,have contributed to some of the thousands of books,articles, book reviews and contributions to books that never answer the question .The question is never answered because the economists appear to have forgotten how to integrate Keynes's derivatives.For example,it is obvious that Keynes's expected aggregate supply function,Z,can't possibly be equal to pO,as claimed by ,for instance,E Roy Weintraub and Paul Davidson,where p equals an actual price and O equals real output.Simple integration of Keynes's derivatives on either pp.55-56,ft.2 or pp.283-285 reveals that Z must be equal to P+wN,where P is equal to expected economic profit,w is a constant short run money wage,and N is total employment.A simple reading of chapter 20 reveals that Keynes's expected aggregate demand function is D=pO,WHERE p IS AN EXPECTED PRICE,not an actual price.Keynes's D=Z locus  makes perfect sense.Unfortunately,this simple result has not been obtained by economists,because economics is not a mathematical science.One can,of course, hope that economics may evolve sufficiently in the future so as to move in the direction of becoming a mathematical science.	2004-11-12

A number of the authors of different essays in this book take it for granted that Davidson's model is a correct representation of Keynes's theory.They are wrong.They then criticize the New Keynesians for not adhering to the correct model of the GT.This is a perfect example of the kettle calling the pot black.Any New Keynesian economist can spot the errors in the Davidson model.This explains why the Post Keynesians and the Cambridge Keynesians have made no progress over the last 65-70 years in gaining any significant hearing from mainstream economists.If you can't integrate simple derivatives,then why even show up for the debate.Hopefully,Davidson,or some other Post Keynesian economist,will do their calculus homework before they make any further challenge to mainstream economics.	2004-11-11

Again,we are told that the economic and/or social world is open,nonergodic and inorganic due to the fact of constant change over time .Lawson is only partly correct. This change is primarily brought on by technological innovation and advance over time that introduces \\"irregular regularity\\",to use Joseph Schumpeter's description of this process,into the social world.This means that the phenomenon studied by economists and other social scientists is a mixed bag that is partly ergodic,partly nonergodic;partly organic,partly inorganic;partly open,partly closed.Lawson is partly incorrect.The particular mixture that is occurring at any particular point in time is sometimes clear and sometimes unclear.However, it is very clear,at least to J M Keynes but not to L, that the problem of sufficient long run investment in long lived durable capital goods(factories,plants,machinery,computer hardware and software)has been  (and will continue to be in the distant future )a CONSTANT problem throughout time.The uncertainty of the information base upon which probabilities(primarily intervals for Keynes) are formed and calculated is a CONSTANT problem for decision makers.Given the fact that the problem of technological obsolescence ,in the face of technological change ,is a CONSTANT problem that repeats either irregularly  or regularly through time,Keynes has all the elements needed to come up with a general theory that will be applicable over time.Given these constants,involuntary unemployment will constantly be occurring ,to a greater or lesser degree,and reoccurring as the amount of spending on fixed investment exhibits its unstable,volatile,\\"unpredictable\\"pattern throughout time.Only on p. 42 of his book does L vaguely appear to recognize this:\\"And many patterns appear and disappear only later to reappear,,,\\".Of course,this is precisely Schumpeter's point,as it was also for Keynes and currently for Benoit Mandelbrot.Finally, L is simply ignorant of the basic nature of Keynesian probabilities.Keynesian probabilities are primarily intervals.The only case where such probabilities could not be specified would be in the case of complete and total ignorance(total uncertainty).L's brief comments about Keynes's approach to probability(pp.173-176)are a caricature of Keynes's theory.L still accepts the erroneous reviews of Keynes's approach to probability made in 1922 and in 1926 by F Ramsey.Nowhere in this book does L operationalize any of the \\"new\\" verbiage and terminology he \\"introduces\\".He presents no clearcut analysis showing HOW he(and/or assorted post keynesians/cambridge keynesians) has improved in any area of  economic or public policy application that has not already been explicitly or implicitly discussed  by J M Keynes.	2004-11-09

Despite the glaring omission of any discussion of Keynes's contributions to decision theory,I still recommend that a specialist buy this book.It contains many valuable articles.	2004-11-09

Shackle (Routledge Studies in the History of Economics)	Books	3	1	3	N	N	Again,let me repeat:Keynesian probabilities are intervals	None of the authors in this book of collected essays appears to have any understanding that ,in general,probabilities for J M Keynes were essentially interval estimates.The same conclusion holds for G L S Shackle himself.Nowhere in any of Shackle's varied and diverse scholarship does he ever consider the possibility that Keynesian probabilities are mainly intervals.Finally, the same conclusion reached above holds for the author of the main essay on Shackle's views on probability,Jochen Runde.Runde writes under the influence of Frank P Ramsey and his two very poor reviews of Keynes's 1921 A Treatise on Probability(TP).Like Ramsey, Runde's assessment of Keynes's TP rests primarily on chapter 3 of the TP combined with chapters 4,6,26 and a few snippets taken from the rest of the other 29 chapters of the TP.Keynes intended chapter 3 of the TP to be an introductory chapter on the measurement of probabilities that would be accessible to a general reader who did not have any specialized knowledge of mathematics,probability,logic and statistics.However, Keynes clearly warned the specialist that only after reading Part II would Keynes's approach to the measurement of probabilities be completely developed.On p. 37 of the TP,Keynes states:\\"It will not be possible to explain in detail how and in what sense a meaning can sometimes be given to the numerical measurement of probabilities until Part II is reached\\".At the beginning of chapter 5 and the end of chapter 10 Keynes repeats this warning.Unfortunately,no economist or philosopher took Keynes at his word and studied what it was that Keynes was doing in Part II of the TP.Instead,in its place, economists and philosophers accepted the error filled claims made by Ramsey about\\"Keynes's mysterious nonnumerical probabilities and degrees of belief.\\"Naturally,the one exception was Bertrand Russell,who recognized the weak nature of both of Ramsey's reviews.It is in chapters 15,17,20 and 22 that Keynes developed and then applied his \\"inexact numerical approximation\\" technique ,involving probabilities with  both upper and lower bounds or limits,to the study of analogy and induction in Part III of the TP.None of the essays in this book deal with or mention Keynes's monumental accomplishment.Keynes is the first scholar in history to put forth a clearcut  mathematical technique to provide interval estimates.Keynes's approach was based on the original work of George Boole.Keynes also mentioned other approaches that could be used to specify his nonnumerical probabilities(intervals)in chapters 5 and 15 of the TP.	2004-11-07

Ramsey in two error filled reviews published in 1922 and 1926.Ramsey referred to Keynes's nonnumerical probabilities as being \\"mysterious\\".The economists cited above in the opening lines of this review just parrot Ramsey's conclusion.Muchlinski then makes these parroted statements the foundation of her assessment of J M Keynes's approach to probability.	2004-11-06

Ramsey in two reviews published in 1922 and 1926.These two reviews reveal that Ramsey did not have the slightest idea about what Keynes was doing in the technical sections of the TP.Let us know turn to the General Theory(GT).None of the authors have any idea about what the specification of Keynes's D-Z model ,introduced in chapter 3 and developed in chapters 20 and 21, requires.Simple integration(taking the antiderivative of Keynes's differentiation analysis)reveals that D,the expected aggregate demand function, must be equal to pO,where p is an expected price and O is real output ,which is a function of the amount of employment,N.Z, the expected aggregate supply function, must be equal to P+wN,where P is expected economic profit and w is a constant money wage.Setting D=Z generates a set of expected possible results,only one of which can occur at any given time.This set specifies the aggregate supply curve ,which is constantly confused by the authors with the expected aggregate supply function,Z.The actual aggregate demand function,Y,is then compared with the D-Z LOCUS in Keynes's theory to determine the amount of involuntary unemployment existing in the economy.However, none of the authors attempts to integrate even one of the derivatives specified by Keynes on pp.55-56,ft.2,pp.280-286,pp.304-306,p.126 or pp.271-278.The failure of the economics profession to integrate Keynes's clearly specified derivatives means that they write about Keynes's model even though they have no idea what that model is.This approach can only be categorized as anti-scientific,to say the least.	2004-11-06

Carabelli,B.Bateman,J.Runde and D.Moggridge concerning the meaning of the words \\"nonnumerical\\"and \\"nonmeasurable\\"used by Keynes in chapter 3 of the TP.Contrary to the above authors,Keynes meant that a single numeral could not ,in general ,be used to estimate a probability.Instead,it took two numerals to estimate a probability.Keynes is the founder of the interval estimate approach to estimating probabilities,where a lower bound and an upper bound specify the probability.Nonnumerical is clearly defined in chapter 15 of the TP on page 160 by Keynes to mean \\"...between numerical limits.\\"Of course, interval estimates are subject to problems of noncomparability,nonrankability and incommensurability.However,the intervals themselves are quantitative estimates of probability.Finally,it is simply incorrect to make the following  claim about Frank Ramsey:\\"He produced the first quantitative theory of how we make decisions\\".(p.777 or p.737).Keynes's interval estimate approach was combined by him with his index,w, to measure the completeness of the evidence upon which probability estimates are based and with his conventional coefficient of weight(w)and risk,c.The goal of the decision maker is to maximize cA,where A is some outcome.Ramsey,who started the misinterpretation of chapter 3 of the TP with his very poor reviews of 1922 and 1926,was second.Keynes was the first toput together a complete quantitative system of decision making.	2004-11-04

I highly recommend this book for the general interest reader.It contains a number of short,but informative,essays,each covering ,on average,2-10 pages.Each essay gives a short biography of an individual scholar who has made a relevant contribution to either theoretical or applied statistics or probability.The contribution is assessed and discussed.Those covered include Sir Ronald Fisher,de Finetti,Ramsey,Savage,Galton,Yule,Karl and Egon Pearson, Harold Jeffreys,and W. Lexis,to name just a few.Surprisingly,the contributions of John Maynard Keynes,George Boole and Benoit Mandelbrot to applied probability and statistics are not covered although each is briefly mentioned in essays covering others.Thus,for instance,Keynes is mentioned in the essay on Frank Ramsey,but no clue is provided the reader about Keynes's original contribution to probability,which was the first systematic exposition of an interval estimate approach to probability analysis based on the work of George Boole.Keynes's contribution is contained in chapters 5,10,15,17 and Part III of his 1921 masterpiece,A Treatise on Probability.Mandelbrot's work,demonstating that there is little,if any, support for the overwhelming use of the normal probability distribution in the study of price movements in financial,stock and commodity markets by financial analysts and economists,calls into question the entire foundation of financial theory that has been built upon the Capital Asset Pricing Model(CAPM)and the Black-Scholes equation.This reviewer feels that the editors could of at least devoted three pages to each of the above mentioned scholars.	2004-11-01

This book is a collection of the most important articles published in applied probability/decision theory through 1988.Some of the articles that are republished in this book are F Ramsey's &#34;Truth and Probability&#34;,H Kyburg's&#34; Bets and Beliefs&#34;,Kahneman and Tversky's &#34;Prospect Theory...&#34;,Issac Levi's &#34;Indeterminate Probabilities&#34;,Daniel Ellsberg's &#34;Risk,Ambiguity and the Savage Axiom's&#34;,Gardenfors and Sahlin's &#34;Unreliable Probabilities...&#34;,among others.This book is highly recommended for the specialist reader.The main criticism of the essays in this book is the complete absence of any discussion about J M Keynes's contributions to applied probability and decision science made in 1921 in his pathbreaking A Treatise on Probability(TP).Gardenfors and Sahlin(GS)make a major error in placing the 1926 Ramsey review of Keynes's TP as the book's first selection.Bertrand Russell was  making an understatement when he stated that the Ramsey reviews of Keynes's TP had the least value of any of Ramsey's published or unpublished work.Ramsey completely misinterpreted Keynes's definitions of the word's&#34;nonnumerical&#34; and &#34;nonmeasurable&#34;in Keynes's introductory chapter 3 in the TP.Ramsey mistakenly assumed that Keynes was arguing that in general a decision maker would be unable to estimate probabilities using numbers (or numerals as Keynes called them).Ramsey thus talks about Keynes's &#34;mysterious nonnumerical probabilities&#34; and/or&#34;mysterious degrees of belief&#34;.In fact,this reviewer can find no value at all in either of Ramsey's reviews with respect to his assessment of Keynes's TP.Contrary to Ramsey,Keynes is the first scholar in history to develop a systematic approach to estimating probabilities using intervals.Each interval has a lower bound and a upper bound.This requires two numerals,not one.Thus ,by nonnumerical Keynes meant that in general it would not be possible to estimate a probability using a single number(i.e.,nonnumerical meant &#34;not by a single numeral&#34;).Of course ,this introduced the problem of overlapping interval estimates.Problems of noncomparability,nonrankability, and incommensurability would complicate the evaluations of probabilities.Ramsey overlooked Keynes's analysis contained in chapters5,10,15,17 and Part III of the TP.Unfortunately,so do all of the other contributors to this book.None of the articles mention that Keynes was the first scholar to specify an index to measure the weight of the evidence.Letting w equal the weight of the evidence,w is defined on the unit interval[0,1]as 0&#60;=w&#60;=1.w measures the completeness of the relevant potential evidence available to a decision maker in order to calculate an estimate of probability.Finally,all of the contributors to this volume of collected essays overlooked Keynes's major contribution to decision theory,his conventional coefficient of risk and weight,c.c incorporates variables needed to deal with nonlinear probability preferences and weight of the evidence problems(Ellsberg calls the problem ambiguity while GS call the problem unreliable probabilities).The goal of Keynes's decision theory is to maximize cA,as opposed to the expected value rule(maximize pA,where p is a reliable probability and A is an outcome)or the expected utility rule(maximize pU(A),where U is a utility function).It is suggested that GS republish Keynes's chapter 26 from the TP in a revised edition so that the potential reader has all the evidence available on Keynes's contribution.	2004-10-31

Richard Jeffrey(RJ)has written an excellent book for the specialist reader.Such a reader needs to have already covered material equivalent to a bachelor's degree in philosophy plus have some familiarity with decision theory applied from a Bayesian perspective,loosely defined.The only objection I  have about  this book is the practically nonexistent treatment of the contributions to decision theory made by J M Keynes in 1921 in his pathbreaking work A Treatise on Probability(TP).RJ either ignores or is simply unaware of Keynes's original work on interval estimates done in chapters 5,10,15,17 and Part III of the TP.Keynes is the first scholar in history to provide an  indepth analysis of an interval estimate approach.Unfortunately,Keynes called his interval estimates &#34;nonnumerical &#34; or &#34;nonmeasurable&#34; probabilities.Keynes's reasoning in using these terms is impeccable.Given that a numerical estimate of probability refers to the use of a single numeral or number,nonnumerical means that one numeral or number ,alone,is not sufficient to specify the probability relationship.In general, two numbers,not one,must be used in order to measure a probability.Naturally, if the interval estimates overlap,problems of noncomparability,nonrankability and incommensurability will occur,greatly complicating an analysis of probabilities.However, it should be clear that interval estimates are quantitative in nature.Unfortunately,F P Ramsey completely botched his two reviews of Keynes's TP in 1922 and 1926,coming up with the strange conclusion that Keynes's nonnumerical probabilities were &#34;mysterious&#34; entities that used NO numbers at all.It is possible that RJ is implicitly relying on these two reviews,since he quotes portions of Ramsey's two reviews at different places in his book.RJ also ignores Keynes's specification of an index,defined on the unit interval[0,1],to measure the completeness of the evidence upon which to base an estimate of a probability.Keynes's called his variable, w ,the weight of the evidence,where 0&#60;=w&#60;=1.Finally,RJ ignores Keynes's conventional coefficient of risk and weight,c. c incorporates nonlinear probability preferences and weight of the evidence(also called the ambiguity,vagueness,or uncertainty of the evidence)into a clearcut decision rule. Keynes's rule specifies that the decision maker seek to maximize cA,where A is the outcome.Again,Keynes was the first scholar in history to specify such a decision rule.RJ needs to include this material in a future revised edition of the present volume.	2004-10-31

In fact,the general case occurring among decision makers in the real world would be of overlapping intervals.Consider the following simple example.Let probability one be estimatedby the interval[.4,.6].Let probability two be estimated by the interval[.5,.7].The probabilities have very specific numeric bounds,but they are ,in fact,nonrankable,noncomparable and nonadditive.It is not possible to say that one of the two probabilities is greater than,less than or equal to the other probability.Skidelsky has accepted at face value the extremely poor analysis of Keynes's TP done by F.Ramsey in two book reviews published in 1922 and 1926.Ramsey committed the fatal error of misinterpreting Keynes's chapter 3 terms in the TP,nonnumerical and nonmeasurable,as meaning that no numbers could in general be used to estimate the probability relation.Ramsey never read chapters 15 and 17 of the TP where Keynes made it clear that most probabilities could be represented as intervals.(The reader will find literally one dozen errors  of omission or commission committed on pp.58-61 and 67-73 of Skidelsky with regard to the issue of the use of numbers in Keynes's logical theory of probability).Skidelsky ignores Keynes's creation of an index to measure the weight of the evidence,w,where w is defined on the unit interval[0,1]and measures the completeness of the relevant potential evidence available upon which to make an estimate of a probability.Skidelsky overlooks Keynes's conventional coefficient of risk and weight,c,that solves all of the paradoxes of subjective expected utility theory.Keynes was the first scholar in history to devise a decision rule incorporating nonlinear probabilities and weight of the evidence(later called ambiguity of the evidence by D.Ellsberg in 1961).Lastly,Skidelsky has overlooked the mathematical specification of Keynes's theory of effective demand that Keynes derived from his Y model of chapter 10  and from his D-Z model of chapters 3,20-21 of the General Theory in 1936.Let us define w to equal a constant money wage,p to equal the price level,w/p to equal the real wage,MPL to equal the marginal product of labor in the aggregate,MPC to equal the marginal propensity to spend on consumption goods, and MPI to equal the marginal propensity to spend on copital goods.Keynes then arrives at the following general result:w/p=MPL/(MPC+MPI).The classical and neoclassical(monetarism,rational expectations,real business cycle theory,etc.)theories are all special cases which require that MPC+MPI=1.Skidelsky's claim that Keynes did not provide a mathematical model of his theory of effective demand in the GT (see pp.537-542,especially p.540)is an error in magnitude equal to the errors made by Frank Ramsey about the meaning of the terms \\"nonnumerical\\" and\\"non measurable\\".The specialist will be disappointed with this volume of Skidelsky's biography of J.M.Keynes.	2004-10-24

Keynes  finally published his pathbreaking work in 1921 in his A Treatise on Probability(TP).A specialist  can only come to the conclusion that Keynes made no breakthroughs in his TP after reading Skidelsky's bare bones treatment.This is most likely due to the fact that Skidelsky is a historian who has no training in the fields of mathematics, probability and statistics.It is true that Skidelsky limits his discussion of the TP in his first volume because he wanted to make an extended discussion of it  in the second volume.Unfortunately,the treatment of the TP in volume II is badly marred by a number of mathematical errors.The interested potential book buyer is advised to read my review of volume II.Skidelsky fails to mention anywhere in Volume I that Keynes is the founder of the interval estimate approach to probability.In general,excluding the cases of symmetry and series or sequences composed of homogeneous frequency data,it takes two numbers,not one,to correctly specify an estimate of probability.A probability estimate is thus made up of a lower bound and an upper bound.Further,Keynes specified a clearcut approximation method based on the original work of George Boole in chapters 15 and 17 of the TP.The reader should note that all of this material is present in Keynes's 1907 and 1909 fellowship theses that he submitted to Cambridge University.Also present in these theses is an index created to measure the weight of the evidence,w.Keynes used different terms to describe weight,such as value,before settling for the term weight in the final published 1921 version.w measure the completeness of the relevant, potential evidence upon which a decision maker is going to base an estimate of probability.w is defined on the unit interval between 0 and 1,i.e.,0<=w<=1.Finally,Skidelsky ignores Keynes's conventional coefficient of risk and weight,c.Keynes presented this coefficient in both the 1907 thesis and the 1909 thesis ,which was accepted.This coefficient is the first time in history that a decision rule incorporated nonlinear probability preferences, as well as the weight of the evidence ,or what D.Ellsberg later called the ambiguity of the evidence  in a 1961 Quarterly Journal of Economics article.	2004-10-24

Contrary to Gerrard\\"...Keynes's original meaning...\\"(pp.58-59) is crystal clear and in no need of any interpretation.This is because Keynes carefully compared his model with that of Pigou in the appendix to chapter 19 of the GT.That comparison leads to the following result.Pigou's special theory is that macroscopic full employment occurs where w/p=MPL, where MPL is equal to the marginal product of labor.Keynes's general theory is that w/p=MPL/(MPC+ MPI),where MPC equals b equals the marginal propensity to consume and MPI equals the marginal propensity to invest.Only in the special case of MPC+MPI equalling 1 will the two theories merge.We can conclude that, in the case of Keynes's GT,the problem is not \\"what did Keynes mean?\\",but\\" why can't economists integrate Keynes's derivatives correctly?\\".	2004-10-21

and &#34;nonmeasurable&#34; in chapter 3 of the TP meant that it was not possible,with some special exceptions,to use numbers to quantify an estimate of probability.Supposedly,this meant that the BEST a decision maker could do would be to ordinally rank probabilities SOME of the time.There is no support for this silly and grossly incorrect interpretation of Keynes's path breaking work on interval(set) estimates done in chapters 15 and 17 of the TP.Keynes also clearly alerted the reader to the importance of these chapters in chapters 3,5 and 10 of the TP.Of course, it is most likely that intervals will overlap.In these cases,problems of incomparability,nonrankability and incommensurability OF THE INTERVALS will occur if the standard ordering relations ,such as less than or equal to,greater than or equal to ,or equal to are used.These two errors in RA appear continuously throughout the book.On pp.78-82,the above twoerrors are committed numerous times .RA's third error follows from errors 1 and 2.It is a combination of nihilism and the antinomian fallacy that all theories are period or time specific and hence always relative to the specific social,legal,political and economic institutions of a particular historical epoch or time period.The conclusion is that general theories are not possible.It is impossible for this reviewer to find any positive redeeming value in this book .However,a reader may want to read this book to measure the degree of ignorance of the economics profession concerning the technical breakthroughs made by J M Keynes almost a century ago.The only other comparable case of economists ignoring pathbreaking work is the case of Benoit Mandelbrot.His work, started in the early 1950's,presents overwhelming evidence that a decision maker can not rely on the normal probability distribution to calculate outcomes in financial markets.Economists still claim that you can.	2004-10-17

Harris,in an article published in the May,1935 issue of the Quarterly Journal of Economics,had already provided a complete micro exposition of Pigou's macro model.A correctly shows that Richard Kahn,Joan Robinson and Austin Robinson were not able to follow the technical,theoretical argument made by Pigou ,that the private sector would always self adjust its allocation of resources over time so as to maintain itself on the boundary of the(PPF) Production Possibilities Frontier(static and dynamic) as long as there was \\"free competition\\"(pure competition)and no government interference in the form of tariffs,unemployment compensation ,social security,minimum wages or unions.It is precisely this conclusion of Pigou's theory that Keynes sought to demonstrate ,through a theoretical,mathematical argument,was a special case of a much more general case.However,since, as A demonstrates, Joan Robinson,Richard Kahn and Austin Robinson were unable to follow Pigou's technical analysis,they attempted to reinterpret Keynes's General Theory(GT) argument,which they  were never able to grasp at anytime during their lifetimes ,as being that the cause of involuntary unemployment was ultimately due to imperfect competition.Of course,imperfect competition was exactly what Kahn and the Robinsons had specialized in during the time Keynes was writing the GT.(A) successfully shows that the condition Pigou arrived at to demonstrate a constant full employment level of output was simply the macroscopic analogue of the microeconomic condition for optimal resource allocation in the private sector.Pigou's condition was that ,in the aggregate,w/p=MPL,where w/p is the realwage,w is the money wage,p is the price level,and MPL is the marginal product of labor.It is at this point that A drops the ball and fumbles as he was approaching the goal line.A bases his entire analysis of Keynes's \\"model\\" on chapter 3 of the GT alone,which has only an introductory ,grammer school ,pre algebra statement of the problem of generalizing the formal neoclassical model presented by Pigou in 1933 so as to integrate the aggregate demand side into the analysis.Keynes's analysis of the formal model of his GT is contained in chapters 10(pp.114-117,p.126),20(pp.280-286), and 21(pp.304-306).Keynes then compares his formal model with Pigou's in the appendix to chapter 19 of the GT on pp.271-278. A fails to present Keynes's generalization,which was that,in the aggregate,the condition for optimal resource allocation ,using the marginalist calculus of rational decision making of neoclassical economics,w/p=MPL/(MPC +MPI),where MPC=the marginal propensity to spend on consumption goods and MPI=the marginal propensity to spend on investment goods(the factories,plants,equipment and machinery used to produce the consumption goods sold in the marketplace).Only in the special case where MPC+MPI=1 will the special neoclassical theory of Pigou be equivalent to the general theory of Keynes.Of course, this requires that, at the theoretical level ,the private sector  of  the economy is always operating on the boundary of its PPF.On the PPF,resource scarcity holds and there is an inverse relationship between consumption goods and investment goods.Only voluntary unemployment would occur.There would be zero involuntary unemployment.Inside the PPF,there is a positive relationship between consumption goods and investment goods.Resource scarcity does not hold and there is some level of involuntary unemployment present due to the failure of business decision makers to invest in  maintaining an optimal,up to date,stock of capital goods intertemporally over time.This is a long run,nota short run,problem.A ignores all of Keynes's chapter 19 analysis and settles for the incomplete conclusion that Keynes simply disagreed with Pigou's conclusion.On the other hand,he correctly deduces that the Robinsons and Richard Kahn effectively sabotaged the Keynesian revolution with their gross errors of misinterpretation .This was most likely due to the severe lack of formal training in mathematics of the Robinsons.Kahn simply tagged alone due to his 50 year love affair with Joan Robinson.	2004-10-17

Selecta Volume E	Books	5	81	85	N	Y	A clear warning to all those financial analysts using N(0,1)	This book deserves to receive 6 stars.Mandelbrot serves up overwhelming  empirical,statistical,and historical evidence that financial decision makers are dead wrong in assuming,contrary to the available evidence, that a normal probability distribution describes the outcomes accurately in financial markets .In fact,the Cauchy distribution is substantially more relevant than the normal distribution.Mandelbrot's work simply means that the standard theoretical models taught in all colleges and universities,the CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL(CAPM) and the BLACK-SCHOLES equation,  give correct answers if and only if the relevant probability distributions about the movement of prices in financial markets over time are all normal.However, the evidence shows that they are NOT normal.Mandelbrot confirms ,by massive data analysis, Keynes's original 1921 objections to the misuse in application of (by merely assuming the applicability of such a distribution without examining the actual data)the normal probability distribution made in chapters 29 and 30 of the A Treatise on Probability(1921).Unfortunately,it appears that little,if any ,of Mandelbrot's scientific approach and analysis is being integrated into economics and finance.	2004-10-14

US	26802692	RUZYZNTWH40GY	0415068754	445250432	The Economics of Rationality	Books	1	2	5	N	N	Keynes's valuable contributions are overlooked in this book	Gerrard(G) and his fellow contributors to this book of collected essays on rationality overlook the major advances made by John Maynard Keynes to this discussion in his A Treatise on Probability(1921).Keynes's first advance was the introduction of the concept of an interval(set)estimate.In general,it takes two numbers or,as Keynes called them,numerals to specify the probability relation.These two numbers are called an upper bound and a lower bound.The only exceptions would be the case of symmetrical evidence and the case where the only relevant evidence consists of statistical frequencies,as in some areas of physics,chemistry,biology and engineering ,where the data has passed some kind of test demonstrating the stability of the frequencies(law of great numbers).Keynes's second major contribution to the rationality debate was his demonstration that rationality in science ,as it relates to scientific discovery by practicing scientists and the growth of scientific knowledge over time,must primarily be inductive,not deductive.Deduction can only rearrange the place settings on a table.It takes induction to add something new to the table.Naturally,Keynes demonstrated this in Part III of the TP by making use of his results from Part II of the TP on inexact numerical approximation(interval estimates)contained in chapters 15 and 17.The third major advance to the topic of rationality made by Keynes was his invention of  a decision rule,which he called a conventional coefficient of risk and weight ,c ,incorporating nonlinear risk preferences and a nonlinear construct to represent the weight of the evidence or the uncertainty of the evidence(what Ellsberg called the ambiguity of the evidence 40 years later in 1961)which Keynes measured on the unit interval between 0 and 1,i.e.,0&#60;=w&#60;=1,where w represents the weight of the evidence(this is the same as Ellsberg's rho). Keynes's contribution was the first time in history that such a decision rule had been specified.Of course, Keynes warned the reader that the decision rule would lead again to interval estimates,given his earlier discussion ,in chapters 3, 15 and 17  of the TP ,on the problems that arose if any of the intervals overlapped.Problems of nonrankability,nonmeasurability and incommensurability arose since it would not be possible to say that one interval(Keynes called the intervals &#34;nonnumerical probabilities&#34;) was greater(less) than or equal to another.Keynes's fourth contribution was his realization that much of the statistical data in the social sciences ,liberal arts ,financial markets,economics and everyday practical decision making could not be represented by a normal probability distribution.In Part V of the TP ,Keynes showed that a decision maker could rely on applications of Chebyshev's Inequality to form a lower bound .The upper bound could be given by the normal distribution.	2004-10-03

The basic problem with this economics textbook is that Mankiw is unable or unwilling to present an analytic,technically sound exposition ,at the Principles level, of the fundamental theoretical difference separating Keynesian and Neoclassical(Classical)economists in 1936 or today.These differences appear in the paradox of thrift.I have already covered this in my review of Samuelson's classic 1948 first edition.Basically ,neoclassicals argue that the economy is naturally selfadjusting under conditions of resource scarcity.Assuming two types of goods and industries,consumption and investment,any type of private sector miscalculation and/or forecast error of the composition of the product mix that businessmen sell is self correcting by means of inventory adjustment.Too many consumption goods and too few investment goods will lead to an inventory adjustment via the Invisible Hand that results in less consumption goods and more investment goods.There is an inverse relationship between the two sectors of the economy.Unfortunately,such an inverse relationship only obtains if the economy is operating on the boundaries of both the static and dynamic production possibilities frontier(ppf) curves.This requires that business forecasts of their capital stock(factories,plants and equipment)are always correct.In general,the private sector is operating in the interior of both ppf's due to the problem of insufficient investment in infrastructure because the capital stock can't be adjusted in the face of constant innovation,advance,and technological change.The physical capital stock is cast in concrete;it is irreversible,irrevocable and industry specific.This explains why investment is unstable,volatile and unpredictable over time while consumption is stable,predictable and nonvolatile.There is no tradeoff between the two kinds of very different goods.It is interesting that the \\"real options\\" theory of Dixit and Pindcyk has come to many of the same conclusions without citing either Samuelson or Keynes.However, there is a solution.Increased public sector investment in needed infrastructure will,through the multiplier process,generate additional income and sales that will create positive expectations of future expected profits for the private sector.This will lead the economy back towards the boundary of both ppf's where the neoclassical marginalist calculus of rational utility and profit maximizers would again become operational.This is the message of both Paul Samuelson and John Maynard Keynes.Mankiw never presents this position in a coherent fashion anywhere in his textbook.The result is that users of Mankiw's book will never have any idea of what set off the Keynesian Revolution and why macroeconomics is splintered.	2004-09-30

The latest edition of Samuelson and Nordhaus is still a very good deal.However,Nordhaus is probably responsible for watering down the exposition,just as Nordhaus is most likely the one responsible for eliminating Samuelson's brilliant exposition of the paradox of thrift in a previous edition of Samuelson and Nordhaus before it was restored.Of course,given that Samuelson is approaching 90 years of age,it is likely that  Nordhaus is going to be able to make further changes to the book that  will weaken Samuelson's evenhanded treatment of the Keynesian-Neoclassical Synthesis.This edition should be looked upon as the last one in a line of succession stretching back to the original 1948 edition.It is this edition that presents the microfoundations of the paradox of thrift analysis using the Production Possibilities Frontier Curve .Neoclassical theory is a special theory of an economy operating on the boundary of this curve(a statistical version would be that the average or mean position of the economy is on the boundary due to a business cycle consisting of minor  inventory changes over time as businessmen in the private sector correct for minor forecast errors made in their product mix).The interested reader can take a look at my detailed review of the original 1948 edition .Such a reader is also adviced to be on guard against \\"reviews\\" that claim that Samuelson said something,but provide no page citation or quote out of context by combining parts of different quotations from different pages of the textbook.	2004-09-30

McConnell and Brue do a B+ job in this book.However,it does not equal Samuelson's introductory textbook  in economics in explanatory power in a number of areas.In this review I will concentrate on just one point of comparison concerning the paradox of thrift.McConnell and Brue effectively discuss this paradox at the macro economic level using the short run aggregate supply curve's three ranges-the horizontal Keynesian range,the upward sloping synthesis range and the Classical-Neoclassical vertical range.If the economy is operating in the Keynesian range or the lower part of the synthesis range,then McConnell and Brue correctly show that more current savings will lead to less future savings due to a decrease in investment and a reverse multiplier effect reducing spending.On the other hand, they correctly show that if the economy is operating in the vertical range,more savings will reduce inflationary pressures while making it possible for investment to increase IF(and only if)businessmen have correct expectations about the future.Samuelson also goes through this analysis.However, Samuelson goes one step further. Samuelson first discusses the linkage at the microeconomic level between the paradox of thrift and its microfoundations in the Production Possibilities Curve(PPF).Essentially, if the economy is operating inside the frontier(on the horizontal Keynesian range or upward sloping portion of the synthesis range),then more savings is detrimental and moves the economy deeper into the interior of the PPF.On the other hand,if the ecomomy is operating on the boundary of the PPF,then more savings can potentially be transformed into more investment,assuming that businessmen, operating in the private sector,have correct expectations about the future.Samuelson demonstrates that in the interior the micro optimality conditions break down and are not operational.McConnell and Brue do not cover this in their textbook.	2004-09-27

(A) appears to lack such training.This is clearly demonstrated in A's unclear and inconsistent discussion of the paradox of thrift as it relates to savings.The paradox depends on where the economy is located in the PPF model. IF the economy is operating on the boundary of the PPF and the private sector has formed a correct forecast of future expected outcomes, THEN additional savings will be transformed into additional investment.On the other hand, IF the private sector is operating in the interior of the PPF and/or is unable to forecast future expected outcomes due to innovation, technological advance or change,THEN additional savings will result in the economy moving deeper into the interior of the PPF as decreased sales leads to decreased profits,increased inventories and a decreased capacity ulilization rate of the existing stock of capital goods.Investment will decrease.The downward spiral will then spread to the consumption goods industries as workers laid off in the investment goods industries stop spending .A reverse multiplier process leads to a further cumulative decline in the economy as a whole.Third,A is severely confused about the role of \\"hoarding\\" and/or savings in Keynes's theory of liquidity preference. Cash is not withdrawn from the banking system and stuck in a mattress. Instead,a higher rate of interest must be paid to the potential hoarder in order to compensate him for his increased preference for liquidity.It is the higher rate of interest, combined with lender's versus borrower's conflicts over risk considerations,that leads to a decline in investment. Fourth, Keynes never claimed that the classical economists assumed full employment at all times. What they assumed was that there was only frictional and voluntary unemployment. Fifth, Keynes never claimed that the classicals did not have a business cycle model. They had a model based on a incorrect,temporary misallocation of resources due to businessmen making mistakes in forecasting the particular future mix of products in their inventories. These errors in demand forecasting would be temporary. This type of cycle can at best explain a mild 6 month recession that is self correcting.It says nothing about the problem of investing in fixed durable capital goods over time or the fact that  such investments represent irreversible and irrevocable sunk capital. The \\" real options\\" approach to capital investment in recent neoclassical type models is an indirect tribute to Keynes's pathbreaking realization that the major cause of  macro failures has to do with a fixed capital stock that is always suboptimal in both the private and public sectors.The economy generally operates in the interior of the PPF.	2004-09-21

Ramsey's fundamental error was to misinterpret the meaning of the words \\"nonnumerical\\" and \\"nonmeasurable\\" as meaning that Keynes had concluded that numbers could not be used to estimate probabilities in general.Contrary to Ramsey,Keynes defined nonnumerical and/or nonmeasurable to mean \\"not by a single numeral but by two numerals\\".Keynesian probabilities are basically set theoretic interval estimates that require an upper bound and a lower bound(two numerals) to estimate probabilities in general.Keynes's axiomatic treatment on pp.135-138 of the TP holds for both determinate and indeterminate probabilities(point estimates and interval(set)estimates).Of course,if any of the intervals overlap,then it will not be possible to order or rank these probabilities.Addition and multiplication operations,in the conventional sense,can't be applied.O'Donnell's conclusion,that by nonnumerical Keynes meant that, excluding cases where the priciple of indifference could be applied to symmetrical evidence,the best a decision maker could do  would be to specify a weak ,comparative ordinal ranking ,in some instances,directly contradicts Keynes's analysis in chapters 15 and 17 of the TP of his \\"approximation\\" approach to interval estimation.It also conflicts with Keynes's implicit agreement that Ramsey's betting quotient approach could be used to elicit interval estimates,although not point estimates ,given incomplete and/or conflicting evidence.Nowhere in any part of his book does O'Donnell show how Keynes's logical approach to probability can be operationalized.A final criticism of this book is that O'Donnell skips all of Part III and Part V of the TP ON INDUCTIONAND STATISTICS. It is precisely in these parts that Keynes does operationalize his approach to probability.	2004-09-21

Robertson's Economic Journal articles).It has practically nothing to do with the work of JM Keynes as contained in his A Treatise on Probability(1921)or his General Theory(1936).A  potential problem for anyone considering reading this book is that D uses many of the same words  and variables Keynes used but gives them different definitions.First,consider Keynes's two basic mathematical models of the GT.The first model is that expected aggregate demand,D=f(N),CAN BE DEFINED AS D=D1+D2=pO,where p=the expected price and O=F(N)is real output,O is a function of total employment,N ,and Z=P+wN=g(N),where P equals expected future profit and w equals the current actual money wage being paid to the aggregate labor force N.Z obviously equals expected profits(P)plus total short run variable costs wN.Keynes called Z the expected aggregate supply function since it depends on future expected profit.Keynes called D the expected aggregate demand function because it depends on future expected prices.Keynes called the SET of all possible expected results the aggregate supply CURVE.It is the set of all possible D=Z INTERSECTIONS.Only one element of the set of all possible D=Z INTERSECTIONS can actually occur.Keynes called this the POINT of EFFECTIVE DEMAND.This outcome is specified by Keynes's SECOND MODEL Y=C+I=PO,where P equals the ACTUAL current price of aggregate output O,C=actual aggregate consumption and I=actual aggregate investment.Y obviously equals actual aggregate demand.D MUST equal expected aggregate demand because D1 equals expected aggregate consumption and D2 equals expected aggregate investment.Davidson ,following  the error filled model of Robertson and Johnson in 1955,redefines Z=pO and D=C+I,where D is redefined to equal actual aggregate demand and Z is redefined to equal the aggregate expected supply.Davidson's D =Z model is incoherent as the left hand side of his equation is  measured in actual values while the right hand side of his equation is measured in expected values.Davidson's error filled model ,which is identical to the error filled mathematical model of Robertson-Johnson first published in the Economic Journal of 1955,has been THE major cause of confusion about Keynes's actual model.There are many,many other parts of this book which are unclear.The potential reader is advised to  work out Keynes's modeling for himself in chapter 20 of the GT unless he is prepared to wade through a large number of logical confusions and mathematical inconsistencies.	2004-09-18

There are a number of other errors in the book.Only one will be covered in this review.F claims that Keynes's use of the term&#34;uncertainty&#34; means or translates as complete ignorance.Keynes never made any such definition.For Keynes,uncertainty ranges from complete uncertainty of evidence(ignorance)through partial or incomplete evidence to complete or certain evidence.Uncertainty can thus be measured on the unit interval from 0 to 1 in exactly the same way  that Keynes measured  the weight of the evidence,w,on the unit interval in the TP on p.315.Keynes then incorporated this index to measure the weight of the evidence into his decision rule c,which he called a&#34;conventional coefficient of weight and risk&#34;.(0&#60;=w&#60;=1).F's claim that a new synthesis of Keynes and neoclassicals can be made based upon incomplete information ignores the fact that Keynes already accomplished such a synthesis in 1936 in the General Theory.	2004-09-17

Samuelson's solution,like Keynes's,is for the public sector to provide an offset to decreasing levels of private investment spending by increased public infrastructure spending.The multiplier process will then lead to increasing incomes ,creating expectations of future profits for businessmen.Private investment will increase,moving the economy back to a position on the boundary of the PPF.Neoclassical economics would then be operational.In summary,no other principles book(or intermediate or graduate level textbook)has ever said it better than Samuelson.Master this book and you will know economics.	2004-09-14

Keynes's opposition to mathematical economics,or more strictly to abstract economics,...was part of a well defined philosophy,which is particularly crucial in understanding the General Theory....because Keynes regarded the economy as an unbounded and yet interrelated swirl of events,he did not think that it was meaningful to distinguish between the dependent and independent variables of the system,between the output and the levers.There are no truly independent variables,because everything influences everything else,and...theeconomic theory...cannot pick up all the interactions\\"(p.139;see also pages 139-145 for F's continued repetition of his claim).F seems to have confused Parmenides with Keynes.Nothing written by Keynes in his lifetime would support any of F's strange speculations.The mathematically literate reader need only turn to chapters 20 and 21 of the GT,followed by a reading of the appendix to chapter 19,where Keynes compares his mathematical model of chapters 20 and 21 with the mathematical model in A C Pigou's 1933 book ,The Theory of Unemployment,to see that F has no evidence to support any of his speculations .Naturally,F does not cover any of Keynes's mathematical analysis.All of Keynes's analysis ,involving the product rule of differential calculus,in chapters 20 and 21,as well as the so called\\"infamous\\"footnote 2 on pp.55-56 of the GT,can be reversed by simple integration and/or integration by parts in order to find Keynes's basic model  of dependent and independent variables.Thus,D=pO and Z =P+wN,where P=EXPECTED profit and p=EXPECTED price.Given O=f(N),D=f(N) and Z=g(N),the dependent and independent variables are clearly defined.	2004-09-10

There is nothing new and/or novel in this \\"economic\\" analysis of the Medieval Catholic Church and the Popes who led it.Once the Church leaders accepted Constantine the First's gift of the Papal States(20%of the land area of modern Italy)around 370 A.D.,the Pope had a dual role to serve as both a spiritual and a temporal leader.This dual role is,to anyone except the Austrian-Libertarian-Anarchist economists who wrote this book,directly contradictory to one of the basic maxims of Christianity.This maxim is one of service and help to one's neighbor's in a communitarian setting without the expectation of some type of pecuniary return.The purpose of the church leader(Pope) was to lever the use of the church's resources and organizational structure to maximize the provision of both the spiritual and human resources needed by the community in order to help its members to live a life according to the Ten Commandments and the Two Great Commandments-Love GOD and love your neighbor.That the church leadership was gradually beginning to sink deeper and deeper into corrupt money making activities that was in no way  aimed at fulfilling the above specified fundamental purpose and mission of the organized church was noticed by Francis of Assisi some 300 years before Luther.It is well known that the church authorities rejected the call of Francis for returning the Church to its original mission of service to the community.The wide selling of indulgences,noticed by Luther ,was just the latest Enron style method of a corrupt church bureaucracy setting pecuniary temporal goals above the spiritual and basic human needs of the community.This has been known for some 500 years.The five authors of this book merely substitute  a model of a corrupt,Enron style corporate monopoly ,emphasizing microeconomic analysis,instead of the usual macroscopic analysis of a corrupt Papal state attempting to manipulate the spiritual needs of the citizens of Catholic Europe so as to rip them off financially.This book suffers from a number of other basic flaws as well. For example, the authors fail to recognize that the Church's usury laws were ,in fact, based on the church's Scholastic,Thomistic philosophy that differentiated between risk and uncertainty.The fact that the Middle Ages were periods of great uncertainty,as opposed to risk,explains the theoretical underpinnings of these laws.J.M.Keynes ,of course,had already reached this conclusion back in 1936.In summary,a reader of this book will reach conclusions already taught in Catholic grammer schools around the late 1950's in the United States.	2004-09-07

Puttaswamaiah and the personal assessment of Samuelson made by F.Hahn.The rest of this review will correct the misstatements of a previous reviewer who appears not to have read the book he claimed to be reviewing.Two quotations are taken out of context from the 12th edition of Samuelson's ECONOMICS textbook written in 1985.No page citations are given. One of the quotations is a misquotation.On p.775,Samuelson states a fact:\\"What counts is results,and there can be no doubt that the Soviet planning system has been a powerful engine for economic growth.\\"The other reviewer skips 14 paragraphs and deliberately gives a misquotation.I will give Samuelson's actual statement and allow future readers of these reviews to make up their own minds as to the accuracy of the other review.On p.776,Samuelson states:\\"The Soviet model has surely demonstrated that a command economy is capable of mobilizing resources for rapid growth and awesome military power.BUT(reviewer's emphasis)it has done so in an atmosphere of great human sacrifice-even loss of life-and political repression.Is such a frightful human toll worth the economic gains?This is one of the most profound dilemmas of human society.\\"Again, SAMUELSON HAS STATED A FACT.	2004-09-06

The Lucas critique represents a small subset of Keynes's much,much larger critique of Tinbergen.Lucas restricts his critique to the effects of changes in government policy on impacting the changing expectations of private sector decision makers over time.Keynes's critique includes not only this variable but quite a few additional variables ,such as changes in technology and innovation,changes in consumer preferences,as well as changes in the existing institutional,political,social and international structure that creates new inductive patterns affecting expectations of the future.There is nothing in the Lucas critique that is new,original,innovative,novel or creative.Keynes gave a general and systematic criticism of Tinbergen which includes the criticisms of Lucas.A vastly superior book on the topics that H tried to cover is the book by Hugo Kuezenkamp,titled\\"Probability,Econometrics and Truth\\".It was published in 2001,the same year as the Hoover volume appeared.Not surprisingly,Hoover does not cite any of Keuzenkamp's published work.Keuzenkamp recognized that the \\"Lucas\\" critique had already  been done by Keynes in 1939-1940.Nowhere in Keuzenkamp's book is the \\"Lucas\\"critique mentioned.The reason is that its already all contained in Keynes's analysis of 1939-1940 ,which follows directly from Keynes's analysis in Parts III and V of the TP.Hoover needs to read this book if he ever intends to revise his own book in a future edition.	2004-09-05

Second,the claim that Keynes \\"... studied economics only briefly...\\"(Steele,p.2) before 1906 is not supported by any evidence.Keynes completely mastered Marshall's Principles textbook ,as well as the 20 plus pages of single spaced mathematical footnotes contained in an appendix at the end of that textbook.Third, S's claim that theTP is\\"...an attempt to outline a theory of probability that might be applied to unique events in a social context...\\",(Steele,p.2)is false.Keynes's TP applies to all propositions about any and all events in all contexts because it is a general theory ,not only of probability,but also of decision making.Fourth,S's claim that Keynes reached the conclusion that\\"...time is more usefully employed in persuasion that(sic)in research based upon sound analysis\\"(Steele,p.3)is directly contrary to Keynes's argument that persuasion is needed to convince ordinary citizens and government officials to accept the sound analysis.Fifth,there is no support for Steele's claim that Keynes attempted\\"... to formalise a new non-deterministic method of economics(Fitzgibbons,1988:129)\\"(Steele,p.21).Finally, the claim that  Keynes believed that \\"...short cuts across technical details do not matter\\"(Steele,p.22)for a theoretical analysis doesn't make any sense because chapters 20 and 21 of the General Theory contain all the details needed for a mathematically literate reader to follow Keynes's analysis.There are literally dozens of other errors scattered through out the book,such as the false claim that Keynes never defined \\"uncertainty\\"(lack of weight of evidence) in the TP(Steele,p.49).The potential book buyer can find Keynes's definition on page 315 of the TP in the last paragraph,where w is defined as being measured on the unit interval between 0 and 1,i.e.,0=<w=<1.	2004-09-05

Kyburg makes the same error again in his discussion of interval estimates on pp.113-115.Keynes is not mentioned.The second omission in this book is the failure to cover Keynes's index for weight of the evidence,w,which Keynes integrated into a decision rule which he called a conventional coefficient of weight and risk,c.There is no discussion of D.Ellsberg's very similar index to measure the ambiguity of the evidence,rho,which Ellsberg likewise integrated into a decision rule.The third omission is Kyburg's failure to discuss the contribution of Carnap in the last chapter of his 1950 book, titled Estimation.Pages 554-559 of Carnap's book are important in that  the reliability of an estimate of a probability ,in areas where statistical frequences are the only source of evidence,such as the atomic and subatomic particles of physics,the molecules of chemistry,and the cells,genes,and chromesomes of biology,is given by the standard error of the estimate,which is the same as Keynes's probable error of the estimate.Carnap's urn ball model and his discussion of it on pages 558-559 reaches practically the same conclusions as reached by Keynes and Ellsberg.Kyburg,unfortunately,restricts his discussion of Carnap only to Carnap's degree of confirmation c(h,e) and the theoretical state and structure descriptions listed by Carnap in the first half of his book	2004-08-06

The three aspects that they deal with in their theory are the irreversibility of costly fixed plant and equipment,the uncertainty of the information base upon which the probabilities will be estimated,and the timing of the investment project over a series of future time periods.DP correctly point out that the NPV rule does not deal with the uncertainty of the information base upon which the probabilities will be calculated while also ignoring the question of the timing of a project,given that additional new relevant information on the potential expected profitability of a project may be forthcoming in future time periods.Thus, there is a value that can be assigned to waiting for this additional relevant evidence to occur in the future.The Net Present Value( NPV) rule or the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)only deals with risk,not uncertainty.Both of these rules assume the existence of a unique,well defined probability distribution that satisfies the law of large numbers.A decision maker need only concern himself with the variability of the outcomes over time. This is measured by the standard deviation.DP demonstrate that the standard approach to investment theory discounts only for time and risk while ignoring uncertainty or conflating uncertainty with risk.DP advocate an additional discount for uncertainty.DP obtain this result using the calculus of variations, optimal control theory,stochastic control theory and dynamic programming.These techniques,while interesting ,are not necessary in order to obtain the given result.A much less advanced mathematical approach was used by John Maynard Keynes to obtain approximately the same result.A criticism of this book would be the failure on the part of DP to mention the similarities between their theory and that of Keynes.Keynes's theory is covered in chapters 11,12 and 17 of Keynes's 1936 book ,titled the General Theory(GT).In chapter 17 ,Keynes makesa very important addition to the theory of the previously mentioned chapters on pages 239-241 where Keynes points out that the decision maker must also discount for uncertainty as well as for risk and time preference.Keynes's footnote on page 240 of the GT directs the reader to his technical model contained in chapter 26 of A Treatise on Probability, called a conventional coefficient of weight and risk c.In order to obtain approximately the same result as obtained by DP,one needed only multiply Keynes's NPV model of chapter 11 of the GT by the c coefficient.	2004-07-23

Davidson,D.Vickers,etc.).H incorrectly claims that Keynes's correct analysis showing that,due to technological change,advance and innovation over time,the study of the determinates of fixed investment in long lived ,physical ,durable capital goods is not homogeneous over time means that\\"...Keynes is inconsistent since this implies that economic theory must be related to historically specific material.\\"(Hodgson,p.223)This simply does not follow,which explains why Keynes correctly ignored the historicists and institutionalists when it came time to write his General Theory in 1936.This is because the problem of investing in costly, fixed ,industry specific capital(factories,plant and equipment,etc.),which is irreversible and irrevocable once it is in place,has been a major decision problem since the dawn of history.The threat of technological obsolescence to the presently existing stock of capital by future innovations has occurred in the past and present and will occur in the future.Of course,there will be similarities and dissimilarities in different periods of history.Keynes has a general theory that explains why the private capital stock in every period of history will be suboptimal.It is suboptimal because investment is suboptimal in the private sector due to the uncertainty,ambiguity(D. Ellsberg's term)or lack of evidential weight(Keynes's term)of a sufficient amount of information upon which to plan such projects over a multiperiod future.This insufficiency then leads to involuntary unemployment.Of course,all this is far beyond the intellectual grasp of H.A similar conclusion applies to V.Chick,who H approvingly cites:\\"Chick's argument underlines the fact that the General Theory was not,in truth,a general theory(since) it applied to a historically specific set of capitalistic institutions\\".(p.224).Chick's fallacious statement is a very good example of the antinomian fallacy .	2004-07-21

Salsburg(S) does an excellent job discussing the historical development of the field of statistics in the 20th century.He has a way of writing that blends current statistical theory with the development of statistics over time from a historical perspective with the individuals who made it all happen,such as Neyman-Pearson and Sir Ronald Fisher.In this book he is close to Ian Hacking in the manner in which he weaves his story.This reviewer has a few quibbles.First,in S's discussion of the personalist(subjectivist)theory of probability,only de Finetti and Savage are covered.Since Frank Ramsey's 1922 and 1926 contributions to the subjective theory of probability,unfortunately combined with error filled critiques of John Maynard Keynes's logical theory of probability,were published BEFORE the work of de Finetti and Savage,he definitely deserved to have a prominent place in any book dealing with the history of probability and statistics.Second,there are a number of errors made in the all to brief discussion of Keynes and his logical theory of probability in his 1921 book,A Treatise on Probability(TP).Contrary to S(p.112,p.305),Keynes never received a doctorate in philosophy for writing the TP because the TP is not a doctoral dissertation.The TP was a thesis submitted for a fellowship, successfully, in 1909 at Cambridge.Keynes added a Part V to his thesis in the period from 1910-1914 to complete his TP.S commits another error when he characterizes Keynesian economic policy as the manipulation of monetary policy.It is the manipulation of both fiscal and monetary policy.Finally,Keynes's probabilities are primarily intervals with a lower and an upper bound,not ordinal rankings as suggested by S.S's flawed appraisel involves a failure to translate Keynes's definition of the term &quot;nonnumerical&quot;,which means&quot;not by a single numeral but by two numerals&quot;.Finally,S is in too much of a hurry to take the side of Neyman,a deductivist, in his debates with Fisher,aninductivist,about significance levels(p-values) and confidence intervals.Neyman's justification for confidence intervals is badly flawed.It essentially boils down to an arbitrary &quot;act of will&quot; on the part of the researcher.Fisher,who was well acquanted with Keynes's logical theory of probability,realized that Neyman's &quot;reasoning&quot; was actually an evasion.Unfortunately,Fisher never was clear about his reservations .Fisher simply needed to come right out and say that a 95% confidence interval means that the researcher is 95% confident that the particular parameter,say the mean,lies in that interval.Of course,this conclusion follows from the proportional syllogism,which is part of the logical theory of probability.Neyman,who was a frequentist,ends up in a quagmire of his own creation because he did not want to allow any &quot;inductive&quot; concepts into his theory.	2004-07-17

They are,first,that \\"Keynes rejected the frequency as well as the subjective interpretations of probability in favour of a ...logical theory...This 'logical' theory of probability,together with his insistence that most probability relations are not measurable...\\".Keynes never rejected either theory.Keynes held that they were both special theories that were sound and valid in a limited number of cases.The logical theory of probability was a general theory that included these other theories within it.Keynes did not object at all to Ramsey's suggested use of betting quotients in order to estimate probability bounds.Likewise ,all  Keynesian probabilities can be measured by either one number or TWO NUMBERS.PS have,like Ramsey misinterpreted the meaning Keynes gave to the terms\\"nonnumerical\\"and/or\\"nonmeasurable\\"(PS,p.144).This same error is committed in essays written by T.Lawson,A.and S.Dow,G. Hodgson and A.Carabelli.Secondly,the claim that\\"...the lesson of The General Theory is that there are no stable economic relations.\\"(p.147),ignores the fact that the consumption function is stable.It is the investment function that is highly unstable and volatile over time ,due to the fact that such irreversible spending on plant and equipment is highly susceptible to becoming obsolete,due to constant innovation and technological change,before the owner of the physical capital good has been able to recover any substantial portion of his huge ,initial, fixed cost.In conclusion,PS alsocorrect the many errors about the Keynes-Tinbergen debate which are incorporated into a number of essays in the same book in which the PS essay appears.The PS essay thus refutes the essays by J.Klant,J.Pheby and T.Lawson.	2004-07-11

The majority of Ellsberg's work is truly original and can be readily applied in the present.Some of the things that Ellsberg does had already been done by J.M. Keynes in his A Treatise on Probability in 1921.Unfortunately, due to the misplaced influence of two error filled reviews of Keynes's approach by Frank Ramsey,95% of the reviews being based on the first 4 chapters of Keynes's book,Keynes's imprecise interval approach,which Keynes called nonnumerical or nonmeasurable probabilities , in order to emphasis the need to use TWO numerals in the estimation of a probability,came to be looked on as some \\"mysterious nonnumerical probabilities\\" that did not obey the laws of probability.Finally,in chapter 26 of A Treatise on Probability , on page 315 and page 315,footnote 2,Keynes specifies an index w ,where w equals the weight of the evidence and measures the degree of the completeness of the relevant evidence upon which the probability estimates are based.W is defined as 0<=w<=1.Keynes then incorporates this index into a decision theoretic criterion rule which he called \\"a conventional coefficient of weight and risk.\\"Letting c designate the \\"conventional coefficient\\",the goal of Keynes's decision rule is to maximize cA,where A is equal to some outcome.In this reviewer's opinion,Keynes's decision rule is,in an overall evaluation, equivalent to Ellsberg's rule .There are some minor differences,since Keynes's representation  incorporates nonlinearity into his weighting function while Ellsberg works with a linear representation.It is the nonlinearity effect which is contributing to the creation of some(many?) of the anomalies and paradoxes in standard SEU theory.Both Ellsberg's and Keynes's work goes a very long way towards correcting these deficiencies.However,Keynes got to the mountain top first.On the other hand,Ellsberg found both a shorter,quicker way(you need to carefully read mainly one chapter,chapter 7,while in the TP you need to read chapters 3,5,6,10,12,15,17,20,22,26,29,and 30)to the top and planted another flag[in addition to rho(Keynes's w),Ellsberg also planted alpha,adapted from Hurwicz.This is a measure of optimism-pessimism.Keynes did not deal with this in the TP.In the General Theory,Keynes dealt with it informally with his conventions and animal spirit concepts].Ellsberg's chapter 7 model can thus supply a complete,formal explanation of Keynes's theories of Liquidity Preference and Marginal Efficiency of Capital in decision theoretic terms that incorporate micro maximizing behavior while simoltaneously explaining macro phenomena.This review has been revised to correct errors made by the reviewer in the original review.I now would assign this book  5 stars.The potential reader will gain much just by analyzing the various examples.For a full understanding,a reader should have taken courses in statistics,probability,and philosophy at the upper division level or have studied the equivalent on his own.	2004-07-07

Consider the following claim made by B:\\"Keynes refused to acknowledge that the probability of x could be defined by the frequency of its future(or past) occurrence\\".(B,p.51).Of course,Keynes did no such thing.In chapter 8 of the TP(1921)Keynes made it very clear that a frequency interpretation of probability was a special theory that had limited applicability.Within its range of application,it is valid and sound.Let us suppose that the only available evidence that is relevant is statistical frequencies,which have passed the Lexis Q test for stability(Law of Large Numbers).The estimate given by a logical theory of probability will be the same as given by a frequency theory.Of course, if there is additional evidence consisting of unique events and/or infrequent events ,which is relevant to the case at hand,a logical probability estimate will start to diverge from a frequency estimate.This is due to a basic defect in frequency theories that deny any relevance to unique and/or infrequent events.This brings us to Frank Ramsey's special subjectivist theory of probability, built on a betting quotients approach,that is supposedly able to reduce all probability estimates to unique,precise, single number answers.According to B,Keynes is supposed to have capitulated to Ramsey in a New Statesman review article published in 1931.Keynes was responding to Ramsey's two error filled reviews published in 1922 and 1926.According to B, this was because   Keynes realized that his nonnumerical and nonmeasurable probabilities could be quantified using betting quotients.Now Keynes would certainly be open to some sort of betting quotient approach.What he would never agree to is that such an approach will in general lead to precise ,single number answers.This is because Keynes viewed most probabilities as being imprecise interval estimates.Nonnumerical and nonmeasurable were defined to mean not by a single numeral or by a single numerical measure.The set of probabilities is then made up of two subsets:precise numerical probabilities and imprecise nonnumerical probabilities requiring TWO numbers to estimate the probability.SUCH ESTIMATION KEYNES CALLED \\"APPROXIMATION\\".It is presented in chapters 15,16 and 17 of the TP.It is based on the original work of George Boole and forms the foundation for the main result derived by Keynes in Part III of the TP for analogy and induction on pp.234-237 and 253-257 of the TP.This result also serves as the foundation for Part V of the TP.                                                                 B's last error is to confuse 1920's Big Business -Big Banking arguments that reforms such as Social Security,Medicare,minimum wage laws,unemployment compensation,and environmental,health,occupational and public safety regulations will \\"undermine\\"business confidence ,\\"causing\\"them not to invest in future plant and equipment,with Keynes's theoretical concept of the weight of the evidence,a deficiency of evidence leading businesses to postpone spending on new plant and equipment due to the uncertainty brought on by the possibility of technological change making their new equipment obsolete before sufficient returns have been generated to cover the huge costs of building a new plant or factory . Keynes always challenged this specious \\"cost of production\\"fallacy that is regularly put forth by various chambers of commerce whenever raises in the minimum wage are being considered in the USA.	2004-07-04

McCann(M)does an above average job in this book except when it comes to evaluating J.M.Keynes's 1921 A Treatise on Probability(TP).Like so many other economists,philosophers and psychologists ,who have written on the TP,he treats chapter 3 of the TP as if it was the most important chapter in the book instead of an introductory chapter in which Keynes seeks to distinguish informally between probabilities which are measurable numerically by a single number and nonmeasurable,nonnumerical probabilities which require TWO numbers to estimate the probability relationship.80% of M's references concerning the TP are to chapter 3 alone.Unfortunately,M's reading of chapter 3 is deficient,leading M to conclude,incorrectly,that Keynesian probability is fundamentally ordinal in nature.In chapters 15,16,and 17 of the TP,Keynes systematically shows how Boole's approach can be adapted and interpreted formally as an interval estimate technique.In chapter 15,Keynes also mentioned other informal methods.Keynes calls this approach &quot;approximation&quot;.M incorrectly states that&quot;...in fact,Keynes's Chapter 15...is devoted to the exposition of a method allowing for the calculation of numerical probability(albeit a rather primitive presentation).What Keynes contended was that numerical probability is not the sole subset of probability theory...&quot;(McCann,1994,p.40,ft.83).This is all incorrect.In chapter 15 ,Keynes presents a technically advanced method for calculating interval estimates using upper and lower bounds or limits.Further,Keynes divided probability into two subset only.They are numerical(precise)probabilities and nonnumerical(imprecise)probabilities.Numerical probabilities require only one number in order to estimate the probability.Nonnumerical probabilities REQUIRE TWO NUMBERS to estimate the probability.Of course,nonnumerical probabilities are not mathematically tractable.Problems of noncomparability,nonrankability,and incommensurability easily arise whenever theinterval estimates overlap.A simple example can be illustrated by considering the following two Keynesian nonnumerical probabilities [.4,.6] and [.5,.7].You cannot say that one or the other is greater than,less than or equal to the other.M's treatment of Induction and Analogy,discussed in Part III of the TP,ignores the crucial fact that Keynes's major result,underlying all of Part III as well as Part V of the TP,on pages 234-237 of the TP and on pages 253-257,is built on a modified version of one of the approximation problems Keynes solves in chapter 17 of the TP.Finally,it may be the case that all we presently know is that the probability is greater than 0 and less than 1.Given Keynes's comments in his lifetime about being precisely wrong versus generally right,he would probably designate this probability by the interval[.01,.99].	2004-07-03

This book is badly marred by the author's failure to carefully differentiate between the classical theory of probability,which was founded in the 17th century,and the logical theory of probability,which J M Keynes started early in the 20th century.Rudolph Carnap made additional contributions in the mid-1950's to the logical theory of probability. In this reviewer's opinion,pp.93-103 contain so many errors of both omission and commission that a novice reader will come away from reading this book with serious gaps in his understanding of what probability means and how it is applied in the real world.The fact that Baron is a strong supporter of the Ramsey-de Finetti subjectivist approach does not justify the very misleading appraisals of the relative frequency and logical theories of probability in his book. Contrary to Baron,Carnap's approach makes use of all the available evidence,including statistical data and relative frequencies.Carnap's approach also makes use of the betting quotients technique used by subjectivists.It simply is not true that\\"Likewise,the logical view is ordinarily useless as a justification for making probability judgments,except in textbook(or casino)cases of\\"fair coins\\"....\\".The second major draw back of this book is the author's strong belief that all probabilities are precise,exact,definite point estimates.Baron apparently believes that there is always sufficient information to represent the probability by a unique single number . (see Baron,pp.94-96). Baron appears to be completely ignorant of J M Keynes's interval valued approach or of the work of Walley ,Levi,Kyburg and The Society for Interval Valued Probability Theory and Application(SIPTA) in reviving Keynes's long dormant approach.	2004-07-02

Keynes then based his entire analysis of analogy and induction in Part III of the TP on a modifiedversion of one of Boole's problems on pp.235-237 and pp.253-257 of theTP.Let's summarise Keynes's position.Given the fact that most probability estimates are impecise intervals rather than precise single number answers,problems of nonrankability,noncomparability and incommensurability will occur.However,ALL probabilities are measurable by either one number or by two numbers.Ramsey was never able to grasp this very straightforward approach of Keynes's.He should have taken the time to read all of Keynes'book .	2004-07-01

M. Keynes and/or his logical theory of probability.Describing Keynes as a&quot;belief dogmatist&quot;is way off the mark given Keynes's penchant for changing his mind as new and/or relevant information and analysis became available over his lifetime.Secondly,it is bizarre for Hacking to claim that Keynes had no use for frequency-type probability theories and jeered at the idea of relative frequency holding in the long run because in the long run we are all dead.(Hacking,pp.146-151).The only frequency theory Keynes ever rejected was that of John Venn.Keynes always considered frequency theories to be accurate and correct for some cases.However,they were not general in scope but limited in their applicability.The interested reader should consult chapter 8 of Keynes's A Treatise on Probability(1921).Finally, Keynes rejected the fallacy of long runism or conditional apriorism because of its unsound argument.The fact that in the long run some process may converge to a particular outcome in the limit offers no support to a do-nothing policy in the present.If the only available relevant evidence bearing on the probability of a proposition is frequency data then the logical probability is the same as the relative frequency estimate.The only caveat Keynes would add would be that the frequency data should have passed the Lexis Q Test for stability.	2004-06-29

Gillies(G)does a very good job covering the subjective,frequency,classical and propensity theories of applied probability.His discussion of his co-authored intersubjective approach,which is to be intermediate between subjective and logical theories of probability  ,is interesting but not convincing to this reader.G fails in his exposition of logical theories in general and Keynes's logical theory specifically.G bases his discussion of Keynes's approach on two chapters of the A Treatise on Probability(1921)[TP],chapters 3 and 4 plus the error filled F.Ramsey reviews of 1922 and 1926,as well as Keynes's 1931 4-page review of Ramsey's published works.G thus commits the same error made by Ramsey in his two reviews.Ramsey completely confuses the meaning of \\"non-numerical probabilities\\" as well as the meaning of nonmeasurable.Keynes meant for chapter 3 of the TP to be an introduction aimed at interested readers with little or no training in mathematics,logic or statistics.A CAREFUL reading lends no support to Ramsey.On p.34,paragraph 3,Keynes clearly states that by nonmeasurable he means not by \\"any numerical relation\\".Thus most probabilities are \\"non-numerical\\",which means \\"not by a single numeral or number\\".It is in chapters 5,10,15,16 and 17 of the TP that Keynes explains his statements on pages 31-32 of the TP about \\"numerical limits\\" and \\"...since the probability lies between(emphasis added by Keynes)two numerical measures.\\"For Keynes ,ALL probabilities are either precise point estimates(numerical probabilities)or non-numerical interval(set)estimates which are imprecise.Imprecise probabilities are nonmeasurable because they are non-numerical.They are non-numerical because two numbers,not one,are required in order to specify the probability relationship.Consider the two following interval(set)estimates[.4,.6] and [.5,.7].They are Keynesian non-numerical probabilities.They are noncomparable,nonrankable and incommensurable.On pages 135-138 of the TP,Keynes provides a generalized axiomatic analysis of the addition and multiplication rules for probability[conjunction and disjunction]that apply to both numerical and non-numerical probabilities.The axioms operate on sets of propositions.Keynes makes valuable extensions to these axioms in chapters 8 and 15.Unfortunately,neither Ramsey nor Gillies read any of these chapters.All of Gillies'references in this book are to chapters 3 and 4.Given that Keynes builds his entire approach to induction and analogy,in Part 3 of the TP ,on both numerical and non-numerical probabilities,Gillies needs to rewrite those parts of his book dealing with Keynes's logical theory of probability.	2004-06-28

The failure to read anything in the TP beyond chapter 3 and a few other scattered pages selected at random is illustrated in the essays written by McCann,Jr. and Meeks.Contrary to Meeks,it simply is not true that\\"...for the full story,see CWVIII,especially Part I,Chapter 3\\".Not a single essay provides even a hint of Keynes's interval estimate approach,except for the mysterious and unsubstantiated claims of Fioretti that Keynes built his interval estimate approach on J von Kries.Keynes himself stated that he was building on the work of the genius George Boole.Not a single essay in this book demonstates for the reader HOW Keynes's approach is operational,excepting cases where the Principle of Indifference is applicable.The reader can learn much more about the applicability of Keynes's system by reading Chapters 29-30 of the TP concerning the use of Chebyshev's Inequality for providing a lower bound for probability estimates.	2004-06-27

These types of probabilities are thus \\"non-numerical\\"because you are not using a single numeral.In 1922 and 1926,Frank Ramsey reviewed Keynes's book based on his reading of chapters 1-4 plus 3 pages from Part two and 4 pages from Part five.Keynes's discussion of non-numerical probabilities takes place in chapters 5,10,15 and 17.Keynes then applies his new approach to induction and analogy in chapters 20 and 22,using his concept of \\"finite probability\\"which applies to both precise numerical probabilities and imprecise non-numerical probabilities.All of Keynes's discoveries ,however,were ignored by the ignorant Ramsey.To this day(2004)one can regularly read about Keynes's \\"strange,mysterious,unfathomable,undefined\\"non-numerical probabilities in literally hundreds of economics and philosophy journal articles based on Ramsey's reviews.Keynes then showed that interval estimates,because they overlap,would very likely also,in many cases,be noncomparable and/or  nonrankable if a decision maker used such order preserving operators like\\"greater than or equal to\\"or \\"less than or equal to\\".While this is quite obvious,it went completely over Ramsey's head.                                                             Keynes's second major advance was to create his \\"conventional coefficient of weight and risk\\", (...) The goal of the decision maker is to Maximize cA.This decision rule solves all of the paradoxes and anomalies that plague subjective expected utility theory.In Part 5 of his book Keynes showed how one could use Chebyshev's Inequality as a lower bound to the normal probability distributions overly precise point estimate . Part 5 of the Treatise  also includes Keynes's advocacy of the Lexis Q test for stability of a statistical frequency[law of large numbers].This will then bring the reader back to Keynes's chapter 8 of the Treatise where he presents his own logical frequency interpretation of probability as a special case of his general logical approach to probability.	2004-06-21

Keynes presented a generalization of neoclassical theory.Keynes starts the GT in chapter 2 where he analyzes the neoclassical theory of the labor market.He notes that the most advanced technical treatmant was presented by Pigou in his 1933 book,The Theory of Unemployment.Keynes demonstrates in the appendix to chapter 19 that Pigou's model of his theory is a special case of Keynes's general model developed in chapters 20 and 21.The primary result of neoclassical theory is that an optimum result (full employment)is obtained in the aggregate labor market if the aggregated real wage(w/p) equals the marginal product of labor(mpl) derived from an aggregated production function(O= phi(N)).This is expressed as w/p=mpl,where w is the money wage,p is the price level,and mpl is the aggregated marginal product of labor.In chapters 20 and 21 Keynes presented his mathematical analysis.This leads to his generalization of the quantity theory's equation of exchange,MV=PO,to incorporate uncertainty and the speculative demand for money besides risk and the transactions demand for money.There are two such generalizations.Chapter 20 analyzes the labor market and the commodity market.Mathematically,there are two ways of expressing Keynes's first generalization in chapter 20-w/p=mpl/ep or the more convenient w/p=mpl/(mpc+mpi).Unless the elasticity ep=1(ep can range from 0 to 1) or the mpc + mpi=<1,the RHS of both equations will rise .This requires that the money wage also rise.Neoclassical theory requires that the money wage fall.The condition that the elasticity ep equal 1 means the economy is operating on the boundary of the aggregate production possibilities function curve because the labor market clearing condition,w/p=mpl, is an economically efficient outcome.It is thus allocatively efficient and productively efficient.             In chapter 21,Keynes presents his generalization of the neoclassical equation of exchange with the money market added to the labor and commodity markets.The mathematical generalization now becomes w/p=mpl/e,where e is the elasticity that\\"... measures the response of money prices to the quantity of money in an aggregated economy\\"(GT,p.305-306).Unless e=1,where e can range between 0 and 1 ,as implicitly assumed by neoclassical economists,the RHS of the above equation will rise and it will be impossible for labor,in the aggregate, to cut its money wage as claimed by neoclassical theory in order to reduce unemployment.Again,the money wage will have to rise.         The final point that needs to be cleared up is that Keynes's aggregate supply function is correctly specified and analyzed mathematically in chapter 20 on p.283 and in a footnote on pp.55-56 of the GT.The reader must be able to apply simple integration to Keynes's derivatives.I give the steps below:         Go to footnote 1 on p.283 of the GT.Keynes defined P to be expected economic profit.The second line from the bottom of this footnote reads as \\" = delta P \\", which is the same as\\" = dP\\".That should actually be \\" = delta P w subscript\\" due to either (a) a typographical error made by the printer in the GT or (b) because Keynes felt that it was obvious,since he divided D=Z through by w,to get Dw subscript = Zw subscript,which means that you must divide P by w.P is AUTOMATICALLY DEFINED IN TERMS OF WAGE UNITS.Pw subscript is equal to Dw subscript-N.Thus dP(or dPw subscript)=d(Dw subscript - N) =dDw subscript -dN.Simple integration gives the following result- Pw subscript=Dw subscript-N.Divide through by w and you obtain P=D-wN.Add wN to both sides.You get P+wN=D=pO or Z =D.Z=P+wN.w is the money wage.N is aggregate employment.p is the expected price level.O is real output,which is a function of N.D,the expected aggregate demand function,is thus equal to expected total revenue.Z,the expected aggregate supply function,is equal to total variable cost plus expected economic profit.     The same analysis and result is contained in footnote 2 on pp.55-56 of the GT.Keynes defines the derivative dZw subscript/dN=dphi(N)/dN =phi'(N)=1,where you use \\"d\\" instead of \\" delta \\" notation used by Keynes.Integrate to obtain Z=wN + C,where C is a constant of integration,after you divide through by w.We know that D=Z by definition and that D=pO from chapter 20.We get wN +C=pO or C=pO-wN once we subtract wN from both sides.By definition,C must be equal to actual profit if p is an actual price and expected profit if p is an expected price.Of course,if P=0,then you get Z=wN = total variable cost.(This is the case of constant returns to labor.Note that Keynes covered this case explicitly at the top of p.284, as well as on p.306 of the GT ,in chapter 21.)This,of course is the mistake that Don Patinkin made continuously from 1976-1989 in 3 books and 5 articles-failing to consider that Z is linear in both the diminishing returns and constant returns to labor cases.Of course,in the case of constant returns to labor,you would get a linear 45 degree cross representing the aggregate supply curve.The same mistake is made by all Post Keynesian economists like Sydney Weintraub, Paul Davidson,Douglas Vickers,Jan Kregel, Victoria Chick,Nevile,Skott and Dutt,etc.They fail to consider that Keynes worked with both cases, diminishing returns to labor as well as constant returns to labor,in his microeconomic analysis contained in chapters 20 and 21 of the GT.It is not surprising that the Post Keynesians can not deal with the technical analysis contained in chapters 20 and 21 of the GTand expressed by Keynes in the form of elasticities.Instead,they build their analysis on the claims of a mathematically illiterate economist named Dennis Robertson.It was Robertson who claimed that Keynes's theory of effective demand(D-Z analysis)was contained in chapter 3 of the GT.All Post Keynesians base their work on the assumption that Robertson was correct.Post Keynesians also confuse the D=Z locus,the aggregate supply curve,with Z,the aggregate supply function.All of these errors can be traced back to the original errors made by Dennis Robertson in correspondence with Keynes in Feb.-Mar.,1935 about the first 17 chapters of the GT.Keynes told Robertson very clearly that the analysis of his D-Z model was in a chapter called the Employment Function.Chapter 20 of the GT is titled,\\" The Employment Function \\".After seventy years it is time for economists to read this chapter upon which KEYNES SAID EVERYTHING DEPENDS.   The reason why ed <1 ep <1,e <1, and mpc+mpi<=1 is that the decision to invest in long lived durable capital goods ,within an economic environment of technological and financial change,advance,and innovation,thus creating the problem of technological obsolescence,is made under conditions of Keynesian uncertainty or Ellsbergian ambiguity.Neoclassical theory postulates that there is no uncertainty or ambiguity,only risk ,which is universally represented as the standard deviation of a normal probability distribution.This means that aggregate investment expenditure will not be erratic,unstable,and insufficient over time.Involuntary unemployment can't result   Keynes argues,as does Daniel Ellsberg implicitly,that the assumption of normality is a special case.Hence ,Keynes's generalization that covers ambiguity and/or uncertainty.This means that aggregate investment will be erratic,unstable,unpredictable,and insufficient over time.Involuntary unemployment will result.	2004-06-18
