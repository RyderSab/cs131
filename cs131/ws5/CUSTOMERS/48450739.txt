This is a good field guide, and the drawings of different birds are nice. I especially like the fact that there are, very often, drawings of juvenile birds alongside the drawings of the adults, and there are usually drawings of both male and female adults. However, the listings for each type of bird are rather short and don't offer much detail. This book is good for visual identification of different birds, but I'll have to stick to other books if I want a more in-depth look at behavior, breeding and nesting habits, etc.	2004-10-28

Fortunately I managed to get past the first chapter of \\"Sound of a Miracle\\", where author Annabel Stehli says \\"I became more and more determined to find a way to become 'just a housewife' and do it justice. I found myself envying uneducated, bovine women who took it all in stride and gloried in seeing their faces reflected in their clean, shining plates.\\" Yuck. I can't believe Stehli wrote something so insulting and ignorant, but the book did get better.<br /><br />The book's main focus is on Stehli's relationships with her two daughters, one of whom is autistic and one of whom has leukemia, and her attempts to get effective treatments for both of them. I found past attitudes toward autism to be both shocking and interesting. At one point, Stehli is grocery shopping, reaches into her somewhat messy tote bag for her wallet, and is told by someone she hardly knows, \\"How do you expect Georgie to be able to organize herself when you're in such a mess?\\" Sadly, such comments seemed to be typical.<br /><br />The first half (or perhaps a bit more) of the book is undoubtedly the most interesting part, and I practically flew through the pages. Stehli's grief, depression, guilt, and society's (and the medical establishment's) attitudes made for a fascinating read.<br /><br />Eventually Stehli's autistic daughter Georgie undergoes auditory therapy in Europe, and at this point, the book became a proud mother's love letter to her daughter. Apparently after Georgie's treatment, she never has another problem again, masters everything she attempts immediately, and is the smartest, most beautiful girl in the world. OK, I can understand Stehli's pride in her daughter's accomplishments, but I still kept wondering...surely Georgie's life couldn't have been that perfect.	2004-10-28

However, in every case, the story ended abruptly, with no warning. I turned the page after the last paragraph in the first story, expecting the story to continue on the following page, and was shocked to discover that the story was at an end. While the stories do progress to what seems to be a foregone conclusion, I still found myself totally unprepared for the endings. There is no winding down; the stories suddenly end, almost as if the concluding parts were lost and never recovered. <br /> <br />	2004-10-28

S.D. Tower has nicely avoided all the usual fantasy cliches--there are no immortal Elves (thank goodness!), no fantastic animals, and no evil deathless rulers. There is a very small bit involving some \\"magic\\" and ancestral spirits, and the tale does not take place in \\"our world\\", but that's it when it comes to the fantasy elements. <br /> <br />The novel is about Lale, a young orphan who is exiled from her village when she accidently loses an item of value. Lale is later adopted by a kind-seeming ruler, who takes her home and places her in a school with other orphaned girls, all of whom adore the ruler they now call \\"Mother\\". After her schooling is finished, Lale is sent for further education--this time to become a spy and assassin. <br /> <br />\\"The Assassins of Tamurin\\" was somewhat predictable. I was never really surprised by any turn of events, and the novel seemed to lack tension. I never felt that Lale was in any real danger--while I did enjoy the character, she was so skillful that failure, or even a minor goof, never seemed like a possibility. While Lale herself is somewhat interesting, most of the other characters in the story were not fleshed out enough. <br /> <br />This book was a quick week-end read, and fine if you're not looking for anything too engaging.	2004-10-28

Prior to reading \\"Uppity Women of the Renaissance\\", I'd only ever heard of Vicki Leon's \\"Uppity Women\\" series, but hadn't read any of them. I found the title to be both intriguing and amusing. Having finished \\"Renaissance\\", I'm not really sure whether I want to read the other books in the series or not. In only 300 pages, Leon covers the lives of 100 of the Renaissance's most uppity women. As you can imagine, 100 women crammed into 300 pages doesn't leave much room for a lot of detail. Many of the women discussed seemed to have been mentioned briefly in old records and not much is actually known about them, other than the fact that they may have, for example, owned a successful business. <br /> <br />Leon attempts to weave modern jokes and cynicisms into the stories, as in \\"Busier than a two-career car-pooler with three kids, La Grosse Margot was one of many women who...\\". Sometimes I found these dashes of humor to be laugh-out-loud funny; other times, they were annoying. <br /> <br />It was really nice to read about so many interesting women. I'd never read or heard anything about most of them before. I just wish there had more detail...a lot more detail. Much of the time, the brief stories seem like sketches or outlines for a wonderful full-length book. Won't some kind-hearted author out there please write a nice full-length book on one of these women? The life of Christian Davies would be a good one to start with! <br />	2004-10-28

I have to admit, I was worried that I wouldn't even be able to finish the book when I ran across this unintentionally hilarious sentence in chapter four, when the diplomat's assistant sees the tall, broad-shouldered pilot for the second time: \\"The same vibrations that had shuddered through her back in Frankfort erupted again now with seismic force...\\" Fortunately, I didn't notice any other writing along those lines, although the author did seem to be obsessed with beautiful, busty women. It's funny the way that male authors so often write about some average-looking, over-the-hill guy who ends up with a drop-dead gorgeous sweet young thing. Personally I would have found this book a lot more fun if the pilot had been a middle aged woman and the diplomat's assistant had been an Orlando Bloom clone!	2004-10-28

Exiting Nirvana&quot; is a mother's account of her autistic daughter, Jessy, and Jessy's life from her teens until the time the book was was published, when Jessy was in her early 40s. I found that the way the chapters of the book were presented was a little bit odd. Instead of starting with Jessy's teens and moving forward, showing her progress that way, the author divides the chapters into aspects of Jessy's behavior and life: i.e., the way Jessy talks and the ways she thinks. I found that some of the chapters seemed to be haphazardly written. Ideas didn't seem to flow easily from one paragraph to the next and were hard to follow. The author spent a lot of time discussing Jessy's obsession with numbers and this portion was especially confusing. I wasn't sure exactly what point the author was trying to get across...other than the fact that Jessy was obsessed with numbers and tended to look at the world that way. Later chapters, however, were quite well written, and I think the author had easier time discussing Jessy's life when Jessy herself was easier for the author to understand.<br />In many ways I thought the book was too short. I wanted to know more about Jessy, particularly about how she interacted with her father and her siblings, which the author barely touches on. We know that Jessy has siblings, but how Jessy fit in with them and interacted with them is rarely mentioned. There is a brief mention of Jessy moving the family cat's water dish, but that was the only clue that the family had any pets, so I was also left wondering how Jessy interacted with the family's pets.<br />However, I do think that &quot;Exiting Nirvana&quot; is helpful in understanding the way an autistic mind works, and is an interesting read for that alone.	2004-06-17

The way the story is presented in &quot;Strange Fits of Passion&quot; is unusual and interesting. Shreve writes of Maureen English, alias Mary Amesbury, who is a victim of domestic violence, in an almost detached manner. Maureen/Mary has finally had enough, takes her 6-month-old daughter and a few hundred dollars in cash, and flees to a small town in northern Maine, where she lives for 6-7 weeks, until her abusive husband finds her. Each chapter is told from a different point-of-view, usually Mary's, but also that of the reporter who is writing an article on Mary, as well as that of the townspeople who live in Maine. The tale starts when Mary first meets her husband and ends after he finds her and their daughter hiding in the Maine cottage. &quot;Strange Fits of Passion&quot; takes place in 1970/1971, when spousal abuse was little known and rarely discussed.<br />Shreve's detached manner in writing the story is, I think, deliberate and is what makes the story interesting. This is not one of those cheesy &quot;woman in jeopardy&quot; stories, but is more a study of the effects of abuse on the victim and how she is viewed by others (and herself). There is some suspense, as we are told from the beginning that &quot;something awful&quot; happened the night that Mary was found by her husband, although it's not hard to figure most of what happened as the tale unfolds. Overall, &quot;Strange Fit of Passion&quot; is a tragedy presented in a nonjudgmental way, and one that lets the reader make up his/her own mind when it comes to the guilt or innocence and circumstances involved in the abusive relationship.	2004-06-17

The writing is beautifully done and the story itself is touching, heartbreaking, surprising, and thought-provoking. It isn't always an easy book to read -- I was worn-out by the time I finally reached the end, but it was worth the ride.<br />The novel is told from the point-of-view of Ellen, an ambitious, successful, intelligent woman who quits her job and returns to her small college town to nurse her mother, who is dying of cancer. While Ellen's mother's cancer is an essential part of the story, &quot;One True Thing&quot; is most effective in its focus on family relationships, how we view and remember those relationships, and the mistakes we make in how we view relationships and each other.<br />One part of the story I especially enjoyed was a conversation between Ellen and her mother, Kate. They were reading &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; and Kate, a warm and nurturing housewife, has a rather interesting opinion. &quot;I remember admiring it but being a little put off by it, too, because it does that cheap thing that people do, it makes the sister who is sweet and domestic and good a second fiddle to the one who is smart and outspoken...It didn't seem fair to me, that Jane was so good and yet Elizabeth is the one who is admired...Jane Austen should have known better than to make women into that kind of either-or thing...Women writers of all people should know better than to pigeonhole women, put them in little groups, the smart one, the sweet one...&quot; This conversation between Ellen and Kate is in many ways the backbone of the story.<br />Also, I was very surprised by the revelation made at the end of the book. Isn't it great when an author can fool you about something? I must admit that I never saw that coming, and up until that moment, the book had not made me cry. It did then.	2004-06-17

Comparisons with the Middle East are hard to ignore.<br />Irustan is a planet where women have no rights whatsoever. The story interweaves the tales of two women: Zahra, a &quot;medicant&quot; (doctor), who lives on Irustan, and Jin-Li Chung, a woman from Earth who works on Irustan and who is masquerading as a man. When Zahra becomes sickened, frustrated, and horrified by the abuse she sees happening around her, she takes matters into her own hands.<br />Character development is excellent here, and the plot moves briskly along. At times this story is gut-wrenching and hard to take, but it's nevertheless a real page turner.	2004-06-17
US	48450739	R1TCJIIYVP2V3U	0739401572	874197698	Vigilant	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Enjoyable.	James Alan Gardner is one of the few male authors I've read who does a good job when it comes to telling a story from a woman's point-of-view. I loved his first novel &quot;Expendable&quot;, and was pleased to see the protagonist, Festina Ramos, show up in &quot;Vigilant&quot;. Festina is more of a supporting character here; the first-person narrative is told by Faye Smallwood, a 40-something woman living on the planet Demoth in the 25th century. Faye becomes a member of &quot;The Vigil&quot;, a watchdog organization that ferrets out government corruption, and the story takes off when Faye becomes a target of assassins who are killing off members of The Vigil.<br />I had a few minor problems with &quot;Vigilant&quot;. Faye's first person narrative annoyed me in a few places. I found it odd that a 40ish-year-old woman living in the 25th century kept using 20th century slang. In several places, I felt the story was underdeveloped, particularly when it came to Faye's relationships with her family. It was interesting that Gardner didn't take the easy way out here and have Faye's &quot;group marriage/commune&quot; life-style fade away as she got older, but Faye's spouses were barely mentioned and when they were, I could never remember which one was which. I would have liked to have gotten to know them better.<br />I also would have liked more background on the how the human/alien Oolom relationship developed on Demoth. The Oolom settled on Demoth first and far outnumbered humans, and yet the Oolom had adapted many human mannerisms instead of the other way around.<br />Overall though, &quot;Vigilant&quot; was a fun read and quite a page-turner. I enjoyed it.	2004-06-17

It's not a very long book, nothing much happens, but I couldn't put it down. The story is about 50-year-old Nan, who begins to question her life and simply drives off one day. She has no destination in mind, drives where she pleases and stops whenever it suits her. She is not really &quot;running away&quot; or looking for a new life -- she knows she'll go back home, but she needs time away. The novel is a series of letters that Nan writes to her husband and of journal entries that she makes in her brand-new diary.<br />One of Berg's strong points as a writer is that she seems to know exactly what women are thinking, feeling, and how they talk. Whenever I read an Elizabeth Berg novel I always get the feeling that it's autobiographical -- that she's letting me share her innermost thoughts and experiences. This is silly, of course, but it always gives her books a truthful feeling that is rare to run across.	2004-06-17

Talk Before Sleep\\" is the story of Ann and Ruth and their friendship, told from the point-of-view of Ann. We learn right from the start of the story that Ruth has been diagnosed with breast cancer, that there is nothing else that can be done for her, and that she is dying. The book shows the development of the womens' friendship from the time they meet, and more than anything else, I think the author tries to show the strong bonds of love and friendship that exist between the women and how special and unique a \\"best friendship\\" can be. Much of the time, it almost feels as if the novel is nonfiction, and Berg admits in an author's note that she lost a friend to breast cancer and wanted to write about that experience.<br />The novel is short, around 200 pages, and I finished reading it in only a few hours. I have to admit that I found the story very difficult to read--not because it was badly written, but because it was so tragic and sad. It did make me a cry (a lot), but the tears didn't feel cathartic. I hate to sound so dramatic, but I felt depressed and grief-stricken by the time I reached the end.	2004-06-17

There is no absolute right or wrong here, and in addition to being entertaining, it's a story to really make you think.  I can hardly wait for the third book in the trilogy to be released.	2004-06-17

This is a great book for anyone interested in learning about the birds who visit our backyard feeders. There are some good tips here--what types of feeders to select, what types of food to offer, how much cover is needed, etc. There is also a wonderful section on how to tell the difference between diffferent breeds of birds that look very similar, i.e. the House Finch and Purple Finch. Quite a bit of the book includes interviews with backyard feeder enthusiasts from different sections of the USA. I was pleased to see one from a town that is very close to my own.<br />The second half of the book lists, with photographs and commentary, the 50 most frequent visitors to backyard bird feeders in the USA. I really wish the list had included the top 100 (or more!) birds, as I'm often seeing birds at my feeders that are not on the list. Also, in some cases, there is only one picture of the named bird, and I much prefer it when there is a picture of both the male and female of the species in question.<br />It seems like I'm grabbing this book a lot though, so it has been quite a help to me.	2004-06-17

It's eerie and suspenseful, and often left me wondering &quot;what the heck is going on here?&quot; while keeping me up way past my bedtime.  There is a subtle but definite feeling of dread that starts in the first chapter and never lets up.<br />The story revolves around a young woman, Ruth, who is fleeing a past of psychological and physical abuse.  Ruth's closest relationship is with her brother Alex, and she heads to the small English town where Alex has recently gotten a teaching job.  When she arrives, she finds that Alex is missing, and the local residents and police are either not helpful or downright hostile.  She visits the school where Alex was teaching and is told by a group of children that Alex was taken by &quot;The Gray Man&quot;, who is apparently a spirit of local legend.<br />The dread builds as Ruth finds herself arrested; she catches glimpses of her former abusive lover, Matt--is he stalking her?  Is he even really there?; she spends an afternoon digging through a field because of a compelling dream; and through it all she will briefly see, from the corner of her eye, a gray vision.<br />&quot;The Lonely Places&quot; ends up being a novel about the psychological consequences of domestic abuse and extreme trauma.  I would have given it five stars, except that the ending was somewhat disappointing and felt rushed.	2003-03-08

On one hand, some of the writing is very well done and some parts of the story, particularly Dave's first meeting with the Dalrei, are moving and enjoyable to read.  On the other hand, the story isn't very original and I never felt very involved with the characters.  The women in particular seemed to be poorly drawn and weren't very likable.<br />The story revolves around five college students who have been brought to the fantasy land of Fionavar, a Middle Earth-like world which Kay tells us is the one true world.  The world of the college students, which is our own world, is but an imperfect reflection.  Kay tells us that problems in Fionavar will be reflected in all other worlds, including our own, but never gives any examples of this.<br />The biggest problem with the trilogy is that the students interact amazingly well with Fionavar and its inhabitants right from the start.  I never understood why it was necessary to have the students originate in our world, because the story as a whole would change very little (and would make more sense) if they had been born and raised in Fionavar.  The students never use the knowledge and skills they've gained in their own world to aid Fionavar.  For instance, when they travel back home, why don't they take firearms and manuals on how to manufacture gunpowder and grenades with them on their return to Fionavar?  Fionavar is a world at war with an ancient evil, and yet they never mention or express a desire for any modern weaponry or a modern means of communication or transportation.  Furthermore, the students never get homesick, they never have trouble adjusting to this new and different culture, and oddly enough, when one of them is killed, no one ever wonders what they'll tell his family and friends back home.<br />After the students are taken to Fionavar, Kay also adds King Arthur and Lancelot to his tale.  For some unexplained reason, Guinevere has been reincarnated but Arthur and Lancelot have to be resurrected.  Once in Fionavar, Arthur and Lancelot don't actually do much and almost seem to be superfluous.  Arthur's dog actually comes across as more heroic and has more personality Arthur does.  It felt like Kay couldn't decide whether he wanted to write an Arthurian novel or a fantasy novel and so decided to blend the two, with results that are less than satisifying.<br />There is a subtle current of sexism running throughout the trilogy that made me uncomfortable.  While some of the most powerful people in Fionavar are women, the women are all involved in either religion or mysticism of some sort.  When it comes to battles, the women are either kept on the sidelines and expected to heal the injured or are left at home.  Kay describes nearly every woman as being earth-shatteringly beautiful and seems to feel that a woman must be beautiful to be important.  Part of Fionavar's history involves a woman called Lisen, who apparently never did anything more than look beautiful and act as an aid to her husband, yet the entire world still mourns her passing.<br />...	2002-10-19

McGregor writes a story that switches from the Franklin expedition of the past to the present day tale of a mother trying to save the life of her ill son.<br />The chapters of &quot;The Ice Child&quot; which are told from the point-of-view of a member of the Franklin expedition are remarkably well-done, involving, and educational.  While we can already guess the ultimate fate of the Arctic explorers, I was still engrossed by their story and was delighted to learn what life as an 1845 explorer was like.<br />The novel's present day story pales in comparison however.  Nothing about the present day characters particularly grabbed me and I never felt emotionally involved with their tale.  The central character suffers so much tragedy in such a short time that I felt I never got to know her.  She merely moved from one tragic event to the next without ever becoming a fully developed character.  This part of the novel was very weak, and for that reason I'm giving it 3 stars.<br />However, two weeks after reading the book I find the story of the Franklin expedition popping into my mind at odd moments.  I'm still haunted by their tale, and believe &quot;The Ice Child&quot; would have been a much better story if it had stuck with the Artic exploration alone.	2002-10-19

After reading part of \\"Fire Bringer\\", I have to wonder exactly what he meant when he states \\"It is one of the best anthropomorhic fantasies know to me.\\"<br />I love WD and have read it many times over the last twenty years.  All of the plot elements are well known to me, which is why an annoying stench began to arise from \\"Fire Bringer\\" somewhere around chaper 4.<br />\\"Fire Bringer\\" starts out well enough, but quickly fails deliver any sort of originality.  The story felt so familiar that it left me angry and disappointed.  Here we have a young deer named Rannoch who is born into a herd that has been taken over by an evil, power-mad despot.  Rannoch and a few other deer are forced to flee because Rannoch bears markings that indicate he is part of a prophecy which will bring about the evil tyrant's downfall.<br />After fleeing, some of the young deer become frightened when they hear wolves howling, so the deer settle down for the night and tell a tale of Starbuck, the great deer hero of legend.<br />A few pages later, Rannoch discovers a bird who has become trapped between two logs and helps free the bird.  The grateful bird then helps Rannoch & Co. escape the evil tyrant's lackeys by showing them how to cross water by using a bridge.<br />After crossing the bridge, the deer meet others who are perfectly willing to let Rannoch and his crew join their herd.  Rannoch, however, feels that something is not quite right with these deer, and a little investigation reveals that the deer are...surprise!...living in a place called a \\"park\\".  The deer are fed by humans, humans protect them from pedators, and in return, the deer agree to be hunted by humans.<br />If you've read \\"Watership Down\\", you'll understand why I stopped reading \\"Fire Bringer\\" at this point.  A little originality goes a long way, and there is almost none in \\"Fire Bringer\\".<br />\\"...one of the best anthropomorhpic fantasies known to me.\\"  Indeed!none in \\"Fire Bringer\\".<br />\\"...one of the best anthropomorhpic fantasies known to me.\\"  Indeed!	2002-07-11
US	48450739	R9RFMI0J7K7MK	0451458109	857184251	The Iron Tower Omnibus (Mithgar)	Books	1	22	36	N	N	Unoriginal and full of cliches	...  I hated this book, and here's why:  Professor Tolkien was truly an expert at languages and world-building.  His words leap off the pages and into our hearts because everything about his Middle-Earth seems utterly real, true, and historical.  McKiernan is simply a ..., and not a very good one.<br />There is very little attempt to give Mithgar a history or a backstory.  The world and its characters are plunged into war almost immediately.  With almost no glimpses of the good in the land, we don't know what makes Mithgar worth saving.  The characters themselves also have very little history.  I wondered, for example, how Laurelin and Galen met, and why Laurelin was staying with his family instead of her own, but no explanation is ever given.  There is a lack of interesting, complex characters like Tolkien's Gollum, Gandalf, or Eowyn.<br />The languages he has his characters use are a complete ... of Tolkien, particularly the Dwarf language.  However, the way the characters speak (especially the Warrows) is inconsistent.  One minute they sound like Spaniards, the next like pirates, and the next like some insane British/American redneck crossbreed.  It nearly drove me nuts.  McKiernan needs to leave invented languages to the experts.  (It took Tolkien more than twelve years to write LoTR, and the languages were something he worked on his entire life.)<br />I was confused by the way McKiernan described the weapons used by the Warrrows.  He says they use bows, and then goes on to tell how they fletched or loaded an arrow, a quarrel, or a bolt.  Well, which was it?  I'm not an expert, but it's my understanding that arrows are used with bows, and quarrels or bolts with crossbows, but the Warrows freely switched between all three.<br />I was forced to skim a great deal of the book because of endless pages that began something like &quot;On the first day...&quot; and told how many miles the host had ridden and where they camped for the night.  Then &quot;On the second day...&quot; there is more of the same.  And the third and the fourth and fifth.  Boring!<br />Now, I know that it's supposed to be OK for men to cry, but this book goes beyond silly with the amount of tears.  The hero Tuck cries on practically every other page, and at one point I was actually giggling out loud because I could not believe that Tuck was sobbing again already.<br />And finally, this book contains the ultimate in cliches:  a kidnapped princess.  Oh please!  We've already seen this storyline 1000 times.  Where's the originality?	2001-06-03

I liked the characters and the setting.  The dilemas they faced were interesting and exciting.  There is a feeling running through both books that is both poignant and bittersweet  Many times I had to stop reading after I'd finished a chapter and take time to think about what I'd just read.<br />&quot;Heaven's Reach&quot; just didn't effect me the same way, and I was disappointed.  I can understand that perhaps the author wanted to delve further into the whole Uplift universe that he's created, and to see what other wonders were lurking there.  However, I felt like too many things were introduced and the orginal storyline seemed to get lost.  The planet Jijo is never revisited, so we don't know what happened to the inhabitants there.  I wasn't nearly as interested in the fate of the five galaxies as I was in the fate of the kidnapped dolphin, Peepoe.  Too many of the characters became flat and uninteresting.  Gillian Baskin in particular was dull and lifeless, but even Emerson and Sara didn't do, say, or think anything memorable.<br />There is a lot going on in the book, and those who like a lot of speculative science as opposed to strong character development may find &quot;Heaven's Reach&quot; an enjoyable read.  We do finally find out the fate of The Streaker, although I was a little disappointed in the way the ending of Streaker's saga was handled and in Herbie's identity.  Several mysteries are simply left unanswered.  Who/what were The Progenitors?  What joke were the Buyur planning, and where did they go?  Why were the Noor/Tytlal present on Jijo?  What happened to Peepoe, Nelo, and the other residents of Jijo, and what about the Jophur ships spotted near Jijo at the end?  What ultimately happened to Creideiki &amp; Co.?  It was a let-down to find that these questions were unaswered, since they were mentioned many times in the books.	2001-04-19
US	48450739	R196QVRB4IB5MP	0812589556	482479809	Dragon Weather (Obsidian Chronicles)	Books	3	3	5	N	N	Neither good nor bad	This book wasn't awful, but it wasn't particularly good either.  &quot;Dragon Weather&quot; is the tale of  Arlian, a boy who is the lone survivor when his village is destroyed by dragons.  Looters find him, only to sell him to a mining company where he works as a slave for seven years before he escapes.  He vows revenge against both the looters who sold him and the dragons who wrecked his village.<br />A lot of the book is pure fantasy fluff.  There are sword duels, magical illusions, and evil villains.  There is also some disturbing, even horrifying, torture and maiming, although I admit that I wasn't strongly effected by it because I never really became emotionally involved in the story.  The characters just didn't seem real to me.<br />For example, Arlian escapes the mines where he lived as slave on meager rations and never saw sunlight or breathed fresh air.  Yet he is described as both big and strong, and doesn't seem to have suffered much during his time as a slave.  His first encounter after escaping the mines is with a brothel full of warm and willing prostitutes, who let him sample their wares for free and then aid his escape.  He hasn't even had a meal or a bath yet, but the author plunks him into the arms of willing woman already?  This was ludicrous, and left me feeling like I was trapped in teenage-boy fantasyland.  Believe it or not, things just go uphill for Arlian after that, as he becomes extremely wealthy and influential, makes a loyal and lasting friend, and becomes pretty darn good at wielding a sword too!  I was also a little put-off by the &quot;Alien&quot; rip-off at the end, but at least the book was a quick and easy read and well-paced.	2001-04-19

I swiped his copy and read it after he was asleep, thinking we'd have a lovely story to dicuss the next day, the way we did after he read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;Ender's Game&quot;.<br />I was wrong.<br />The problem with &quot;Anthem&quot; is that there is simply no story here.  The book might as well have been a non-fiction essay, because it repeatedly beats you over the head with the author's views.  There is no attempt at subtlety, so the book becomes preachy.  The point the author is trying to make is something that we all already know anyway, so I didn't read the book and come away thinking &quot;Eureka!  I really see the world differently now!&quot;<br />There is a big difference between a beautifully written story that is able to blend the author's views into a masterfully crafted and entertaining tale (like Orson Scott Card often does) and a plain old boring statement that just wants to get the point across to the reader, which is what this book is.<br />Frankly, I'm disgusted that my son had to waste his time with this book.  No wonder it's so hard to get kids to read when they're force fed this stuff.	2001-03-12
US	48450739	RYDOJRMCBDPD7	0553573306	229747971	Brightness Reef (The Uplift Trilogy, Book 1)	Books	4	3	4	N	N	I really enjoyed Brightness Reef.	I've seen several lukewarm reviews for this book, and I can understand why a lot of readers didn't particularly like it.  The pace is rather slow until the end, the PoV switches with each new chapter, and there are a lot of characters to get to know.  It does take a while to get totally immersed in the world of Jijo.  However, once I became familiar with the setting and the characters, I found the planet Jijo and its inhabitants to be fascinating.<br />Most of the book involves the six races of beings, including humans, who live (illegally) on Jijo.  They've managed to overcome their differences and live in relative peace, but are always fearful of a &quot;judgment day,&quot; when their colonies may be discovered.  And then a ship lands on a Jijo, an enigmatic and seriously injured stranger is discovered, and a local youth sees monsters in the oceans.<br />The slow pace didn't keep me from enjoying Jijo and all its wonders.  Brin takes his time introducing us to each new character and tries to get us to understand the six races, their histories, and the ethical dilemas they and their members face.<br />For those of you who thought the fate of The Streaker would forever be unknown, this book gives a small hint of things to come.  The pace picks up at the end of the book, and we learn just what beasts dwell within the oceans and the identity of the stranger.  By the time I read last sentence, my heart was pounding with anticipation.  I can't wait to dive into Infinity's Shore.	2001-03-12

The book is a collection of true stories that explore the special bond between humans and their pets or, in some cases, their wild animal friends.  Because each story is written by a different author, there is a great deal of variation in the writing styles and in the stories themselves, but almost every story is touching in some way.  A lot of the book did leave me in tears, but it was still such an enjoyable read that I finished the book in less than 24 hours.  My only complaint is that I felt too many of the stories focused on death or ended in death.  Our pets lead such short lives, and I would have preferred a few more humorous or heroic tales.<br />Some of my favorite stories in the collection:<br />&quot;Delayed Delivery&quot; is the story of an elderly widow who is spending her first Christmas alone, until she becomes the recipient of a very special gift.<br />&quot;Turkeys&quot; is an amusing little story that is worth sharing.  A young girl, sick with the measles and a high fever, wakes up to discover that her bed is full of baby turkeys.  Is she dreaming?<br />&quot;Doctola&quot; is the only story in the collection that actually sent shivers down my spine.  A young vet, working as a Peace Corps volunteer in Africa, is able to save the lives of two puppies.  He is assured by the local &quot;medicine man&quot; the puppies will some day repay him, and they do, in a manner that left me both thoughtful and spooked.<br />&quot;Babblers Anonymous&quot; is the story that I could relate to more than any other.  It's a short and humorous look at a sensible woman who is determined to treat her cat with the dignity he deservers, and to never ever be caught in the &quot;baby talk&quot; trap.<br />Enjoy!	2000-12-21
US	48450739	R5IZTJVPKL1P3	0345417623	786105285	Timeline	Books	2	0	0	N	N	This isn't a novel.  It's a thinly disguised screenplay.	I enjoyed the first part of &quot;Timeline&quot; quite a bit.  I love the &quot;What in the world is going on here?  This is a fascinating mystery.&quot; feeling that some books inspire.  Unfortunately, after everything is explained, the book takes a turn for the worse and reads more like an action movie screenplay than a novel.  This wouldn't have been a problem except that the action scenes and near brushes with death are so cliched and familiar.  For instance, one of the characters is locked in a cage and slowly lowered into a pit of oily black water.  A fight ensues as his friends battle for their lives and for control of the winch that is lowering him to his death.  This whole scene was so reminiscent of the second &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; movie (but without the humor or the charming rogue of a hero) that it actually left me feeling disgusted over the lack of originality.<br />A further problem was that the characters simply weren't interesting enough for me to care what happened to them.  We're only given a very sketchy description of each one before they are sent into danger, and once they begin their journey, they don't do much except run, hide, and fight for their lives.  There is very little meaningful dialogue or emotion.  Two of the characters are killed almost immediately, but the others never mention it or show any concern.  One of the protagonists, Andre Marek, has an ultimate fate that is so glaringly obvious that the ending is no surprise.  We know what will happen to him from the moment he is introduced.<br />The plot involves a rescue attempt by a group of history students who must find their professor, who is trapped in the past and unable to return to the present.  They are sent back in time, to a date when they know the professor is in trouble.  According to the book, there can be no paradoxes in time travel, so I didn't understand why the students entered the past on that particular date.  Logically, they should have gone back to the point atwhich the professor first entered the past, before he got into trouble.  Furthermore, since there can be no paradoxes, why weren't the two characters who were killed rescued as well?  It would have been simple enough to, again, send someone back to a point in time a minute before they arrived and warn them. <br />There was, however, one paragraph in the book that I found to be profound.  From chapter 01:13:52:  &quot;In other centuries, human beings wanted to be saved, or improved, or freed, or educated.  But in our century, they want to be entertained.  The great fear is not of disease or death, but of boredom.  A sense of time on our hands, a sense of nothing to do.  A sense that we are not amused.&quot; -page 443  Very true, Mr. Crichton, and I thank you for the insight.	2000-12-02

The story is too unsophisticated for adults and is too full of sexual references for children.  It might have made a fine &quot;young adult&quot; novel if not for the frequent sexual content.<br />The first chapter reads like some sappy &quot;true confession&quot; romance magazine and involves a sex scene between a 13 year old girl and a 14 year old boy, which occurs not long after they first meet.  There seemed to be no reason for the children to have had sex.  Why not have them share a first kiss instead?  Or, if the sex serves some purpose, why not make them older?<br />The heroine of the story, Rhapsody, is just too good to be true.  She begins the book as the most beautiful woman living, but a few chapters later, she transforms herself into a goddess-like being who is the most beautiful woman who has ever graced the planet.  She is good and kind to all she meets, talented at everything she attempts, and humble too.  Every single man she meets, from the youthful to the elderly priest, from friend to enemy, is filled with lust at the sight of her.  A child might have accepted this description and been able to view Rhapsody with admiration, but an adult reader is quickly going to be grinding teeth over Rhapsody's perfection.  It is nearly impossible to identify with her, or to want her to succeed.<br />The story is full of holes and leaps of logic that, again, will leave an adult frowning.  For instance, during her transformation into the goddess-like being, Rhapsody also regains her virginity.  How this is done is never fully explained, but let's look at it logically.  Rhapsody and her lovers apparently still have their sexual memories, so if she knows that she's had sex, how can she possibly be a virgin?  And as any doctor will tell you, there is no physical proof of virginity.<br />Prior to the start of the novel, Rhapsody worked as a prostitute.  Her previous occupation seems to make no sense, given what else we learn about the character.  Since the author makes Rhapsody talented at virtually every skill there is, why would she choose such a profession?<br />Rhapsody is miserable throughout the entire story because she's been dragged forward in time and desperately misses her family, especially her mother.   Yet Rhapsody admits that she ran away from home as a young girl.  She was apparently gone from home for years, but she made no effort to write to her family or to travel to see them.  During a brief stay, Rhapsody &quot;adopts&quot; some children that she meets and during the rest of story, she worries about them, she writes to them, and she stops to buy them gifts.  If Rhapsody is such a caring person, why didn't she show the same concern for those she claims she loved most of all?<br />Rhapsody's major talent in the book is her ability at music and singing.  She is apparently able to change the very nature of reality with the power of her voice, as is shown when she sees an abusive father and his son and is able to completely change their relationship.  If she is this talented, why doesn't Rhapsody use this incredible power to to fix, for example, the murder/war situation that occurs with Achmed's people?  And finally, if she is so lonesome for home, why doesn't she sing her way back in time?	2000-11-24

I hate to say it, but I've spent too much time with these characters, and it's becoming hard to care what happens to them.  I especially have a hard time with the way women are portrayed in this series.  At first, I found it refreshing to see such a large number of strong and influential female characters.  However, after spending thousands of pages reading about them, it's becoming clear that, first of all, almost every woman in the series is a carbon copy of every other woman, and second of all, that Robert Jordan has a tough time writing from a woman's point-of-view.<br />Nearly every woman in this series has a horrible temper.  She manages to get her way by either &quot;the temper tantrum&quot;, &quot;the frosty glare&quot;, &quot;the sniff&quot;, or some combination of the three.  She believes it is her solemn duty to keep a man from getting &quot;a swollen head&quot; or &quot;too big for his hat.&quot;  She calls every man a &quot;big-headed fool.&quot;  When there is a group of women, they spend a great deal of time discussing men and men's shortcomings, punctuating every sentence with an exasperated &quot;Men!&quot;  The problem here is that women don't really act that way.  I haven't seen that kind of behavior since I was in jr. high school, but the women here act that way all the time.  Even the Ogier women control the men.  It's silly and repetitious.  The male characters are much better, because each one has separate and identifiable personality.<br />Since the Aes Sedi play such a large role in the series, let's look at them at little more closely.  First of all, every member of the Red Ajah is exactly the same as every other member.  They're all just cold, unfeeling, rabid man-haters.  Jordan tells us that the Red Ajah has always been the largest Ajah.  Their purpose is to find men who can channel.  OK, but prior to the start of this series, men who can channel were very rare.  So why does the Red Ajah have so many members, and what did they do with themselves in the years between finding that rare man who did channel?  Members are the Brown Ajah are always dreamy and distracted and usually have an ink stain somewhere on their faces.  Do members of the Yellow Ajah, the healers, ever heal anything besides battle injuries, and where did they get their bedside manner?  All Aes Sedai seem arrogant and distrustful.  No wonder the general populace fears and dislikes them.  They have so much power, but they don't use it with any compassion.  The only time an Aes Sedai shows much real human emotion is when her warder is killed.<br />The repetition of the descriptions in the series is also starting to be monotonous and annoying.  Every dress is &quot;slashed with cream&quot;, every meal consists of &quot;turnips and peas&quot;, items are always &quot;thumb-thick&quot;, braids are always &quot;wrist-thick&quot;, and wool clothing is always &quot;stout&quot;.  Every woman in the series &quot;crosses her arms beneath her breasts&quot; at least twice a day.  It's time to describe things in a new and fresh way.  Please!<br />The final problem I have with the series is that there are way too many foretellings, dreams, and visions.  Are there any suprises left to come?  We know what will happen to Rand, we know what will happen to Mat, we know what will happen to Thom and Moiraine.  Even if one of the characters frequently wishes for something to happen, it does.  (i.e. Nynaeve thinking that &quot;stilling&quot; could be healed, and the way everyone kept telling Egwene she'd be the Amyrlin Seat if she worked hard enough.)<br />In conclusion, there's just too much repetition here too hold my interest.  If the series had been shorter, it would have been a classic.  Instead, the same things are repeated over &amp; over &amp; over.  They were good the first time, but now it's time to move on.emselves in the years between finding that rare man who did channel?
