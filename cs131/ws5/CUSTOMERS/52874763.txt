Her Gentilized remake of this remarkable Jewish woman is almost laughable, were it not laced with subtle anti-semitism.  As a Jewish feminist, I do not judge my Catholic sister; but Cunneen seems oblivious to how much she projects her own alienation from Catholicism onto Mary -- as though de-judaizing this woman of faith is the best way to make her a model for Gentile feminists.	2001-04-12

In fact, this guys gets it more wrong than any of the poor folks he attacks.<br />For instance, Podles misrepresents St. Bernard of Clairvaux, very badly, and the Church's Marian dogmas and devotions in the process.  And St. Ambrose and Origen are sneered at a bit too much.<br />But that's not my problem. It's Podles' tone: Smug and strident, shrill and self-righteous, and so patronizing...<br />Consistently, he shows a hyper-critical attitude towards others (like Pope John Paul II); all the while posturing himself as &quot;more-macho-than-thou&quot;.  In the end, he ended up sounding more than a little bit effeminate, at least to this reader.

Wills is a good writer, and he CAN be a good historian.  But when he deals with issues pertaining to his own religion, there certainly appears to be a big blind spot.  The visceral replaces the analytical. Arguments give way to screeds.  And political correctness displaces objectivity.  Even for those of us who agree with his positions against the Roman Pontiff (I'm not Catholic), it's clear that this book should have been thoroughly overhauled, if not deep-sixed, instead of being published as is.	2000-12-12

Granted, it's only the first volume, but if Hahn and Mitch can maintain this high quality in future volumes, the Ignatius Study Bible will become a landmark in Catholic Bible publishing for centuries to come.<br />It has everything: outlines, maps, cross references, and commentary that opens up the doctrinal and spiritual and apologetic significance of key texts.  What stands out as the best feature is the constant recourse to Old Testament texts and traditions.  The typology reminds me of Jerome and Augustine. The use of patristic interpretations is my favorite part, by far.    <br />While I appreciate the Navarre Bible, the Ignatius Study Bible is MUCH better.  <br />A few criticisms are in order. For one thing, the side margins are way too small. People who use Study Bibles (like me), also write in their Bibles.  There's no room.  Besides, the layout of the pages looks much too crowded without wider margins.  Second, it looks too much like a pamphlet; instead, it ought to be bound like a booklet, with a real spine with title and author.  That way, we can know what we're pulling off the shelf. One more thing, the authors' names (Hahn and Mitch) ought to be on the cover, like all other Study Bibles.	2000-10-30

I have never read a more compelling description of the beauty and truth of the Catholic faith.  Scott and Kimberly Hahn give a very moving account of their intellectual and spiritual journey, as well as their personal struggles in becoming Catholics.  It's aimed at the level of the average Christian, so non-experts like me can see the biblical basis for Catholicism.  I appreciated how they didn't take cheap shots at Protestantism, but focused on their discovery of the Catholic Church.  As a Presbyterian, that's exactly what I needed.  <br />To think that Protestantism was established, as a matter of historical fact, on the basis of two unbiblical slogans: &quot;Sola Scriptura&quot; and &quot;Sola Fide,&quot; is such a sad testimony to intellectual pride and the separatist spirit.  It seems like such a shame that people are still wasting their personal energies coming up with elaborate defenses of something that comes down to, as another reviewer described it, &quot;Luther's intemperate sound-bytes&quot;.  Perhaps it's time for us to get over it.  More than ever before, I find myself longing for peace and unity in Christ's Church.  So I guess it's time for me to let it begin with me...	2000-09-29

I found this to be a truly remarkable book.  Hahn has obviously achieved a  high level of biblical scholarship.  But he always manages to distill it in  very readable prose.  Unlike so many other Scripture scholars, he wears his  great learning lightly.  In every chapter I discovered profound insights  into important and difficult texts of Scripture, interwoven with a warm and  engaging sense of humor.  It's clear that Hahn writes to feed God's people  the Bread of Life, and not simply to impress his scholarly peers. By the  end of the book, I was overwhelmed with a new sense of appreciation for the  rich harmony between the Old and New Testaments.  As an evangelical convert  to Catholicism and a newly ordained priest, I speak for many fellow-priests  and former seminarians in saying, THIS is how Scripture ought to be taught!	2000-09-19

Over 35 years ago, Garry Wills wrote &quot;Politics and Catholic  Freedom,&quot; and I respected him for it, even though I disagreed with  much of what he had to say.

Apparently, Wills cares little for  either.  As I read this book, I kept wondering if the author ever stopped  writing long enough to figure out that he was writing about a faith that he  no longer holds.  Yet, it's not as though he lost his religion.  He simply  traded it in for a new one.  This became obvious once I noticed how he  unquestioningly accepts every &quot;politically correct&quot; dogma of  democratic liberalism, and with such docility.  Then, he turns around and  uses his new-found infallible authority to clobber his old one.  Honest and  courageous?  Only for fellow devotees and fawning reviewers.	2000-09-03

The Lamb's Supper combines solid scriptural scholarship and theological  orthodoxy, and delivers it at a popular level.  The result is potentially  life-changing. It is disconcerting, then, to read some comments made below  by the reviewer from Drexel Hill, who managed to squeeze almost as many  misrepresentations into his brief review as the puns Hahn sprinkles  thoughout an entire chapter.<br />First, the &quot;essential point&quot; that  the reviewer says &quot;Hahn fails to mention&quot; is found, according to  my count, at least four times (read pages 23-24, 28, 36, 150), and that in  a book of only 163 pages!  Take heart, Fr. Groeschel, you and Dr Hahn may  not be heretics after all.<br />Second, the Drexel Hill reviewer seems to miss  (or misrepresent) the essential point of the entire book, that the Mass is  a true participation in Christ's high priestly sacrifice, which is the  liturgy of heaven.  Much like Luther and Calvin, the reviewer fails to  recognize how the Apocalypse depicts Christ's heavenly activity as high  priestly and sacrificial. Like the Reformers, he reduces Christ being in  heaven simply &quot;to adore the Father and intercede for the Church,&quot;  as he puts it.  That misses the  essential point of John's Revelation,  where Jesus is constantly depicted as &quot;the Lamb standing as though it  had been slain,&quot; for the purpose of highlighting his high priestly  sacrifice, which stands at the heart of the heavenly liturgy, and the Mass.   <br />Third, what the reviewer calls Hahn's and Groeschel's &quot;fatal  flaw&quot; appears rather to be his own.  I took his advice and read  Paragraph #1085 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church.  What I found is  exactly what The Lamb's Supper presents, &quot;the Paschal mystery&quot; is  identified with &quot;the Cross and Resurrection,&quot; not with Calvary  alone.  That is why the Catechism goes on in the next five paragraphs to  describe how, &quot;in the earthly liturgy... we participate in the  heavenly liturgy&quot; (#1086-1090).<br />Fourth, Hahn was careful to run his  &quot;scriptural ruminations&quot; by other dogmatic theologians (I was  one), as well as liturgical specialists, biblical scholars, and orthodox  bishops. Perchance, one of his approving readers has been a member of the  Pontifical Roman Theological Academy. Indeed, apart from this churlish  review, nobody else has expressed any doubt about the orthodoxy of The  Lamb's Supper, or Fr. Groeschel. At the end of the day, some old-fashioned  soul-searching may be in order, should there be any professional jealousy  or envy.  Do not just study, learn from the Little Flower.	2000-08-03

Meanwhile,  one of the members of the Bible Study has adopted it as a text for his  Religion class at a local Catholic high school.  He says they love it too.

As a Bible-believing Christian myself, I would strongly recommend it, especially for anyone who's willing to listen to and  learn from a very sensible presentation of why a die-hard Protestant like  Hahn would feel compelled by the Bible to become a Catholic. Even though it  is clearly written and charitably argued, it's probably not the best book  to give someone who prefers public debates or polemical writings, like a  previous reviewer who seems to be looking for a fight. (Just for the  record, his critique was not only saracastic, but unreliable--James White  told me himself that Scott Hahn NEVER agreed to a debate him.  Likewise, if  he truly read the book, he'd know that the Hahns went to a  non-denominational Evangelical seminary--Gordon-Conwell is not  Presbyterian.  Oh well.)  In my opinion, any sincere Bible-believer who  reads this book with an open mind will be challenged, as I am, but  certainly not disappointed.	2000-01-06
