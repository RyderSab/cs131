Rather it also introduces the flora, habitat, and physical geography of Vietnam, and it covers all slipper orchids of southeast Asia in very complete detail.<br />The last 2/3rds of the book is a treasure of information about the individual species of Vietnam slippers. It contains lots of field pictures, closeups of the flowers, flower diagrams, and distribution maps. I was impressed with the completeness of the treatment for each orchid. This is a superb slipper orchid reference book.<br />If you are a Paphiopedilum orchid book enthusiast - times are very good. There are presently three absolutely outstanding slipper orchid books in press: &quot;The Genus Paphiopedilum&quot; by Braem, Baker &amp; Baker, &quot;The Slipper Orchids&quot; by Catherine Cash, and &quot;Slipper Orchids of Vietnam&quot; by Leonid Averyanov, Phillip Cribb, Phan Ke Loc &amp; Nguyen Tien Hiep. Each book sets the highest standard of excellence. We slipper orchid hobbyists are truly blessed to have such talented and passionate writers on this subject. I reference each of these books several times each month. They are great additions to my orchid library.<br />There is total concensus over 2/3rds of the species in all of the books. But there are major disagreements over much of the rest. Discussions in the text are filled with little daggers about what the other book authors had missed or misinterpreted - it is facinating! Since Slipper Orchids of Vietnam was written after the other two books, Averyanov &amp; Cribb have the last word in the arguement. But I suspect that new books from Braem and Cash are already in the making.<br />It's a great time to be a slipper orchid enthusiast. You gotta buy this book!	2003-07-11
US	52989581	R28KPF15NGP8MB	0881921831	328412529	The Slipper Orchids	Books	5	19	19	N	N	Ultimate slipper orchid reference	The book contains about 220 pages composed of: 17 pages on orchid anatomy, biology, and basic taxonomy overview, 18 pages on growing conditions, 35 pages on the genus Cypripedium, 56 pages on the genus Paphiopedilum, 5 pages on the genus Selenipedium, 15 pages on the genus Phragmipedium, 61 pages on hybridization and a historic review of crosses, and a 13 page bibliography. The book contains 225 color photographs (most are 3&quot; x 4&quot; in size). Each photograph displays an orchid in flower and each plant is identified to species or variety. Pages are large, pages measure 8 1/2&quot; x 11&quot; in size.<br />Approximately 140 species are described with great detail. Each species is listed with geographic distribution, cultural notes, plant description, flowering season and other comments. The author continues in most sections with an detailed discussion concluded with an assortment of opinions, conclusions, and predictions. It is a facinating, thought provoking, and important body of work. I loved it!<br />The author, Catherine Cash, makes bold assertions throughout the book. I found myself arguing with many of her opinions and conclusions. I was amazed. Not that I disagreed with some of her statements, but that her statements actually got me to put the book down, think about what she had said, and then eagerly go back to read more. Books about plant taxonomy is usually pretty dry stuff. But Ms. Cash has made reading about the slipper orchids a rare treat. It is a carefully written reference book.<br />Her chapter on the hybridization of orchids is alone worth the price of the book. This chapter is an outstanding read. Cash challenges many of the current philosophies about orchid science and hybridization. She is clear, crisp, and wonderfully opinionated.<br />It is a complete work. 2/3rds of the book contains facts, details, and photographs - a great referrence section. 1/3rd of the book contains commentary, discussion, and opinions - a provoking insight to the field of orchid science.<br />This is a must have book for any slipper orchid grower.field of orchid science.<br />This is a must have book for any slipper orchid grower.	2002-10-31

Sadly, this is not a well written book.<br />The text is boring. The descriptions are flat and uninteresting. Photographs are blurry and display unattractive flowers. Content is poorly organized. For example, photographs do not accompany the text description. Photographs are rather all lumped together in the center of the book. There are no maps. I have no clue where Borneo is and a map would be extremely helpful. In addition, I would have liked to have seen distribution maps for each species. Also, I would like to see comparative displays of the plant anatomy, rather than a drawing here and a drawing there. Was I suppose to flip through the pages to compare how species &quot;A&quot; differs from species &quot;B&quot;? Couldn't a visual taxonomic key have been written?<br />The book has major flaws. Still, I gave it a 4-star rating. Why? Because the remaining material is so critically important. There is an outstanding wealth of information about Phalaenopsis in the book. It contains historical reflection and modern observations. Major taxonomic changes are introduced and discussed. Much of the data is new and has not been observed before, at least not in this amount of detail. It contains excellent plant sketches and voluminous descriptions about plant anatomy. Unfortunately, it is cluttered with enough scientific terminology to make it worthly of a fine dust collector on your book shelf.<br />I am hugely disappointed with the book. It has so muchimportant information that I will not likely reference because it too damn difficult to find in this book. For example, which Phalaenopsis have a fragrance? These details are in the book somewhere, but I would have to look up every species, one at a time, in order to obtain this answer.<br />Great information. Poorly written and awkwardly organized. If you love Phalaenopsis, this is a must have book. Just accept the flaws and use it the best you can.	2002-10-31

Sections are Annuals (29 pages), Bulbs (29 pages), Fruits (34 pages), Herbs and Vegetables (30 pages), Houseplants (30 pages), Lawns (26 pages), Perennials (30 pages), Roses (28 pages), Shrubs (32 pages), Trees (30 pages), and Vines & Groundcovers (30 pages). <br />What makes the book unique is that each section discusses the material for every month (hence the title, \\"month by month\\"). Each month contains about 2 pages of instructions for planning, planting, care, watering, fertilizer, pests, and pruning. Each section starts with several pages introducing the topic.<br />Example of Melinda Myers advice: Tree section (April), \\"Do not prune Oaks and Honeylocust once growth begins. Wait until the dormant season to avoid disease problems\\".<br />Oops, I wish I would have had this book earlier. I did prune my Oak in April a few years back, and I now have a disease problem.<br />Besides the great plant instructions, the books contains amazing maps of Wisconsin (page size maps with county names). Maps contain USDA Cold Hardiness, Annual Precipation, Average First Frost, and Average Last Frost. Also includes lists of crop dates, UW Extension Service addresses, dry tolerate perennials, and much much more.<br />This is an excellent wealth of plant tips for anyone gardening in Wisconsin. It's a must have book!	2002-07-19

Book contains about 154 pages and is divided into 6 sections. The sections discuss Light, Artificial Light, HID Lamps, Reflectors, Setup, and Electricity Basics. Appendices include Radiant Energy, Requirements of Plants, Troubleshooting, Types of Lamps, Glossary, and Index.<br />The book is a mixed bag of great information and cluttered lists of data. The major theme of the book wanders about. Some of the discussions contradict each other. For example, Van Patten does a masterful job describing why useful light for plants should not be measured in lumens. But then he goes ahead and displays his huge listing of light readings in lumens. Why? You made your point, use PAR Watts.<br />In another section, Van Patten decribes every possible detail about horticultural lamps and reflector systems, but draws no summary with a specific list of brands and models. Don't get me wrong, he lists lots of data. Pages and pages of spreadsheet like lumen data for over 115 models of bulbs. Pages and pages of 54 three dimensional charts. Yah, great, you did lots of research - but I don't need to see all the raw data. Just tell me which bulb I should buy. Maybe give me a top ten list. Should I really care what the lumens are for the 97th best bulb?<br />Many conclusions are very vague. For example Van Patten actually writes, &quot;we still do not know which lamp is best&quot;. Gee, that a great reason to write a book.<br />I'm torn as how to rate this book. The book contains many jewels of information that are well researched and finely written. Some of Van Patten's findings are exciting, extremely interesting, and even thought provolking. But in between is a littered jumble of confusing tables and charts. It's disorganized. There are lots of typographical errors throughout. He should have hired a book editor before publishing this (or hired a smarter one).<br />If you plan to garden indoors with HID lights, you must buy this book (you have no other choice but this book, because there are no other texts available). The book is most valuable to purchase BEFORE you select a HID system. It will save you from making a costly mistake.<br />PS: I use two HID lamps, a 400 watt Agrosun and a 400 watt Sunmaster Warm Deluxe. Both are installed in identical Hydrofarm Super Grow Wing Systems. I love the results - I can grow anything!	2002-07-19

Book contains about 298 pages divided into three sections. The sections are Orchid Cultivation &amp; Description (15 pages), Species Encyclopedia (270 pages), and Glossary &amp; Index (13 pages).<br />The focus of the book is the orchid species encyclopedia. Each orchid is listed with information on genus, tribe, etymology, and a paragraph describing the characteristics of the orchid and its history. About 2/3rds of the species also include a photograph.<br />Photography is excellent. Hundreds of clear, crisp, and properly identified images fill the book. It is truly an illustrated encyclopedia.<br />I love this book! It is exactly the kind of reference book I needed. Being new to orchids, I have a difficult time seeing a name in a catalog and relating it to an image of an orchid flower. This book is great, it has helped me discover many new and interesting species. Well, at least they are new to me :-)<br />My library contains several books on orchid culture that gives me clues to growing the plants. But this book identifies hundreds of genera, and 1100 species. Best orchid species encyclopedia that I've seen. Great reference book!	2002-07-19

Book contains about 250 pages and is divided into 14 sections. Sections are Trees, Conifers, Shrubs, Perennials, Annuals, Climbers, Roses, Bulbs, Alpines, Aquatic, Cacti, Orchids, Ferns, and Grasses. Each section contains a general introduction, followed by a detailed list of 150 to 300 plants. Each plant is identified to species and variety. Each contain a paragraph or two of information (like flower color, bloom time, hardiness zone, etc). About five pictures per page (about 2&quot; size). Pictures are very crisp and clear. Solid photography.<br />This is a great plant encyclopedia, lots of excellent information!<br />Another fine encyclopedia is the, &quot;American Horticultural Society A To Z Encyclopedia Of Garden Plants&quot;. I own both books and both are great values. You can never have too much plant information :-)<br />The &quot;Encyclopedia of Garden Plants&quot; is a valuable source for plant identification and horticultural facts.

Book contains about 425 pages divided into 4 major sections:  Annuals, Perennials, Bulbs, and Trees &amp; Shrubs. Each section describes 100 plants (hence the title, &quot;400 Best Garden Plants&quot;). <br />Each plant is described by habit, leaves, flowers, light, soil, fertilizer, pruning, propagation, uses, etc. The information is fairly meager, about one sentence per item. Many of the sentences are repetitive and extremely general. For example, &quot;fertilize with 5-10-5&quot;, is listed as advice for 97 out of 100 annuals. I'm not saying the advice is wrong, I just wonder why it must be repeated 97 times. At the beginning of the annual section, couldn't they say &quot;fertilize most annual with 5-10-5&quot;, then go into details about the three plants that get treated differently. (By the way, the 3 special case plants are Amaranthus, Basil, and Flowering Maple).<br />The photography is a high point. Images are crisp and clear, most pictures are large (6 inches height). Unfortunately, the species or variety in the photograph is never identified.<br />The information is very general. For example, one of the 100 Best Perennials is listed as Anemone (Windflower, European Pasqueflower, Japanese Anemone). Egads! There is an extreme difference between two inch tall Windflower and three feet tall Japanese Anemone. Then they list uses as &quot;cut flowers&quot;. Yeah, right! I can just see them now, on their hands and knees, harvesting the tiny flowers from the two inch tall plant. Listing characteristics of Windflower, European Pasqueflower, and Japanese Anemone in the same discussion is not useful gardening advice.<br />I have mixed feelings about this book. It's a great beginner's guide, but not a complete encyclopedia. Expert gardeners will find little of value in the book. For beginners, it's a 5 star book. For garden experts, it's only a 3 star.	2002-07-19

The sections are Environment, Nutrients, Rooting Medium, Hormones, and Cuttings. The book contains several hand sketches.<br />The book is well written and covers many fundamentals about growing plants indoor. Also, it's original information. This book is not just a re-write from Van Patten's other book, &quot;Gardening Indoors with HID Lights&quot;. It is completely different information. All new writing.<br />This is a solid beginner's guide. Although, the book does make the process sound way too simple. In my first attempt, all my cuttings died. Yes - I did follow the instructions. But it's not as simple as it first looks. It takes several attempts to get good at propagating plants.<br />I wish the book had a troubleshooting section. Answering questions like, &quot;why are my little plants turning yellow?&quot; <BR>It's a small book, but packed with information. A good value.	2002-07-19

Each genera is described in about 12 paragraphs with comments about specific growing needs, species and hybrids, tips for success, and about 5 photographs of representative plants. 1 page on orchid suppliers and a 4 page index.<br />When I bought my first orchid, I purchased it with an excellent book called &quot;Easy Orchids&quot; by Mimi Luebbermann. The Luebbermann book got me through the first several months (and the first 6 orchids). The Ortho book adds to the excellent information that you obtained with Luebbermann. Ortho gives you that vital information necessary to take your orchid addiction ... er, I mean, your orchid hobby to the next level (and another 6 orchids). <br />Ortho's All About Orchids contains excellent information for the beginner.

One hundred days later, not only is the orchid still alive, but the flowers are still in bloom! Gee, I guess I can grow orchids, especially with guidance from this book.<br />Is growing orchids addictive? Well, I started with one orchid. One hundred days laters, I now own six plants ... and I'm looking to buy more. All because of this damn book :-) <br />The book is a great introduction to growing orchids for the beginner.

This section also includes about 90 photographs. Photos appear rather dull and faded, not high quality printing. Most images are also rather small.<br />The second section contains a 95 page tropical plant encyclopedia, 11 page plant list for different environments, 3 page plant nursery list, and an 11 page index. The encyclopedia describes 101 plants giving common name, scientific name, native growing zone, gardening tips, and typical cultivars. Each description includes a small photograph of the plant.<br />Information in the first section is mostly fluff. Long wandering sentences that lead nowhere. This is supplemented by the same old garden design stuff that you can find in many other books. My first impression when I put the book down was that this was a book written in the 1950s. Nothing special.<br />The second section is the encyclopedia, and while nearly one full page is written about each plant - little is said. Garden advice is weak, no specifics are given. Most plant tags contain more real information.<br />The only bright spot is a brief chapter on overwintering tropicals. This chapter becomes modestly interesting, but ends way too soon.<br />Overall, the book is a disappointment. Small snippets of important information are scattered amongst the text, but mostly it just rambles along.<br />It a nice book to buy as a holiday present for that relative you've never been real fond of :-)	2001-09-07

Great layout of information with a photograph of each plant. Too bad this isn't the major concentration of the book - because this section is awesome!<br />Overall the book is a good general guide to designing with tropical plants.

Whether your interest is as a botanist, horticulturalist, conservationist, or perennial gardener, you will find the information to be complete and exceptionally well written.<br />The book is a monograph on Trillium. It is the single key source of information on this genus. It is such a great blend of botany, horticulture, and inspired writing, that all other genus specific books will have to be measured against this work.

Several other B&amp;W photographs are scattered about the book.<br />The book is about growing Bromeliads, or at least growing Bromeliads in Australia. It occasionally has some local reference to an Australian city or region, but mostly the information is generic. It does suffer from regular references to the metric system and Celsius temperatures. For this reader, being a Yank and living on the frozen tundra up here in Wisconsin, metric &amp; celsius measures don't make much sense.<br />Facts in the book are modestly interesting and modestly informative. It tends to chase around the facts. For example, &quot;overwatering will rot the plants&quot;. Dah - yah think? So, what exactly is the proper amount of water? The book is not always crisp about specifics.<br />It's a good book, but not a great book. There is much information, but the book's structure makes it hard to find. Plant photographs are not adjacent to their descriptions - you have to page around to find the photo. The text is small and therefore reading gets to be a chore.<br />I like sections of the book, but other sections could be much improved. The book is inexpensive, and by that measure you get good value. For the money, it's a good introduction to growing Bromeliads.	2001-09-05

Excellent information and easy to follow instructions. Every page contains a tip or trick about plant propagation.<br />My favorite section is the 16 pages of plant specific propagation notes and comments. Hundreds of plants  are listed. It's like reading Mother Nature's secret diary! Everything you every wanted to know about how to make more plants (but growers never would tell you) is contained in this section. All alone, these  propagation notes are worth the price of the book.<br />If you want to get your hands dirty, this is a great &quot;how to&quot; guide for plant propagation. You'll recover the cost of this book over your next garden season.<br />Excellent information!	2001-06-20

It is better described as a beginners guide to  shade gardening, with some reference to Hostas.<br />The book contains: 83 pages on general shade gardening,  garden design, seasonal garden observations, soil  preparation, and plant propagation. 15 pages on Hostas (17 species and 37 cultivars), each receiving one small paragraph of information. 30 pages about 119 other  shade plants, again each receiving one small paragraph of information. 1 page listing plant suppliers and 1  page listing societies.<br />Book has a 4 page index. Both cover pages contain a paper fold to act as a page place holder (when you put the book down, you can find where you left off - a nice touch).<br />Photography is great. Images are clear, colorful, and show interesting plants. Most pictures contain a comment line that properly identifies the plant to species or  variety.<br />The book is not a great reference manual on Hostas. It merely introduces the beginning gardener to shade plants  and describes the more common Hostas. Information is  solid and helpful, but there is not a lot of depth.<br />If you're looking for a lightweight introduction to shade gardening - then this is a very good choice.<br />It's a thin book that is priced around $[price]. Overall, it's  a bargin!	2001-06-20

I can't tell the difference between a House Finch and a Purple Finch even if they're sitting side by side.<br />Here was my normal birding routine. I poured myself a  cup of coffee. I looked out the window and saw a little  gray bird. &quot;Gee&quot;, I wondered, &quot;What is that?&quot; I pulled the North American Bird Guide off the shelf and three cups of coffee later, I'm still wondering what I saw.  But, I had it narrowed down to a mere four dozen birds.<br />Birds of Wisconsin makes this search a snap. First, there are only 111 birds in the whole book - and they are birds that I actually see in Wisconsin! Second, there is a large picture (4&quot; x 6&quot;) of every bird with a description on the opposite page - what a great idea! Third, there is a Wisconsin state map showing  the range of the bird (summer, winter, year round).<br />Each description contains information on size, male / female / juvenile characteristics, nest, eggs,  incubation, fledging, migration, food, and notes.  The notes point out which bird looks similar and what  to compare. Also contains interesting facts and  comments. Did you know a House Sparrow was really  a Finch?<br />The book contains a two page index / checklist (when  you only have 111 birds, you can fit them on two pages).<br />Identifying birds is once again fun. I actually can find the bird that I'm after, and often before it flies away.<br />Book images are crisp and clean. Excellent information and interesting notes throughout. Very easy to use, and fits nicely in a jacket pocket.<br />Great book for Wisconsin birders!<br />PS: The little gray bird was a White Crowned Sparrow :-)	2001-06-20

A great book.<br />Thirty pages on the botany, anatomy, and classification of grasses. Twenty pages on native habitat, thirty pages on designing with grasses, and  twenty pages of growing and propagating grasses. 170 page encyclopedia  listing 400+ species / varieties of grasses. Each species is described in a  paragraph or two of text along side a clear photograph of the plant. In the  back of the book, you find a 2 page glossary, 5 page bibliography, 2 page  grass nursery listing, USDA and European hardiness maps, and a complete  index of all grasses by common name. Very complete book.<br />As a bonus, the  book is also filled with awesome photography.<br />If you garden with  ornamental grasses, this book is a must buy. Excellent information, well  worth the money!	2000-01-28

Something you look at once, then never touch again. Clearly not a reference book.<br />The first 85 pages discuss forcing hardy and tender bulbs. The remaining 68 pages talk about house  plants, twigs, and cuttings. About half of the book is pictures, and much  of the text from the other half is double spaced. There is not alot of  information about forcing in this book.<br />Another problem, the book has no  index. So when you wish to find information on forcing Amaryllis, you must  page through it manually. No appendix in the back, no tables, no charts,  and no reference section at all (except for a meager list of two dozen  garden catalog companies).<br />There are pockets of detailed and interesting  facts. But the poorly organized format makes it a chore to find this  info.<br />On the plus side, the plant photography is great. It is the most  worthwhile part of the book. Hundreds of photos of interesting, clear,  crisp, and properly identified plants populate this book (unfortunately,  since there is no index, you'll never find the picture you want - when you  want it).<br />Nice coffee table book, but not much more.	2000-01-28

The book is okay, but it is not a great reference book. It has several faults:<br />First, the book is suppose to be about grasses,  yet 25% of the text discusses garden flowers.<br />Second, many of the photos  are cluttered or blurred. There were few species specific photos that  displayed a single clear crisp grass variety.<br />Third, the book rambles and  takes the long way to discribe a simple observation. Some readers will  enjoy this style, but it's not for me. I want something that gets to the  point.<br />Fourth, the species reference (called 'Selected Plant Catalogue'),  is sparse and dated. For example, Calamagrostis x acutiflora 'Overdam' is  covered in just three words, 'outstanding variegated form'. Gee ... somehow  I was expecting more information. There is not one photo of Overdam in the  entire book. Likewise, there is no photo of Festuca glauca 'Elijah Blue'.  These are two very popular grasses to have been leftout.<br />On the positive  side, there are some neat winter photographs of grasses, and the book  contains some useful information (but it is difficult to find it when you  need it).<br />This is the kind of book that you're suppose to sit and read  from cover to cover. A pleasure reading book. Not what I do with garden  books, I read them rather like an encyclopedia - and this is not a good  choice for a reference book.	1999-12-25

And these pages  contain some of the best information that I have ever read in a garden  book.

The info is perfectly arranged with two pages of text per each  species. Each contain a paragraph on  when to plant, where to plant, how to  plant, care, additional info, and other varieties. My kind of book - all  the info in one place and easy to find.<br />If you garden in Wisconsin, this  is a must have book!<br />Unlike all my other garden books, I actual know of  every species talked about in this book.

And best, Myers tells us about some popular plants that  don't do well here (I wish the plant nursery would have told me this before  they sold me many wrong varieties). I learned this by trial and error.<br />My  only criticism about the book is that I wish she had written another  volume. Great information!	1999-12-25

It contains 128 photographs of individual plant varieties. Great clean bright photos make identification easy (well as easy as it gets with grasses).<br />It contains an 'Encyclopedia of Grasses', some  104 pages of text that contain two or three paragraphs about each variety.  There is also 40 some pages on general ornamental grass information, and 50  additional grasses in the garden photos.<br />It's a good book on ornamental  grasses, and almost a great book. Worth the money, especially if you have  no other reference book on ornamental grasses. Still, there are some minor  criticisms:<br />First, the book is only 4-1/2 inches wide. I lose it in the  bookcase, I find it hard to hold, and the damn thing won't stay open to the  page I was reading unless I hold it open.<br />Second, the picture is on one  page, and the text is someplace else. Couldn't we put the picture and the  text on the same page. Doh! - what a concept.<br />Third, some of the  information is very exact, while other information is vague. For example,  some growing conditions are listed as 'sun or shade' - well, that just  about covers it. Could we be more specific, like 'it grows best in sun, but  tolerates shades'.<br />Don't get me wrong, I do like this book. I use it  frequently and it's the best ornamental grass book that I own. Clearly  worth the money.	1999-12-25

I own nearly 100 garden plant books, if my home caught fire and I could only save one book - this would be it. I buy nursery plants through mail order and I look for new and unusual plants to add to my garden. Everytime  I look up a plant in this encyclopedia I find it, along with growing  details, comments about species or varieties, and a color photograph. Very  comprehensive, very complete, and great information.<br />The only downside is  that this 1100 page book is so heavy it takes two hands to lift it out from  the bookshelf (I guess that's a small price to pay for completeness). If  you can measure information by weight, than this book is a bargin!<br />Every  serious gardener must have this book. The next time you come across a plant  name that you don't know, you will be very pleased that you own this  encyclopedia.	1999-01-26
