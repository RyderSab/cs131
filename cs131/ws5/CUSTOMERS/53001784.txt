It opened up what was, in that day, the wilderness.<br /><br />It also stirred up a hornets nest of political and financial battles that made and ruined the careers of many men. And it's on these battles that Bernstein focuses most of his attention.<br /><br />This is not a book in the same vein as McCullough's book about the Panama Canal or Ambrose's handling of the transcontinental railroad. Bernstein spends precious little time on the actual building of the canal, and even the map support is pretty weak-- just one big and not very detailed map of the canal path in the front of the book.<br /><br />There's extensive background on canal building, a thorough explanation of the political background of the time, and a full and vivid depiction of some of the critical political figures (particularly De Witt Clinton, who emerges as the main character in this tale). The building of the canal is put in clear and cogent context; it just isn't shown very much.<br /><br />If you want to know how the country and New York found a way to get the canal built, what it meant, what effects it had, why is was important in US history, this book does a superlative job. If you want to know what it was like to actually build it, you may be a bit frustrated by this work.	2005-06-26

It is easy to create a main character who is, even in her struggles, perfect and saintlike. <br /> <br />Goska creates a character whose journey is sometimes hard to watch, sometimes painful to read. It is not as neat and warm and fuzzy as, say, a pleasant afternoon read for the Oprah crowd. Sometimes her main character is open, honest and giving-- in other moments, she can be a self-ceneterd jerk.  <br /> <br />But at all times this woman is real and believable and completely absorbing, and her struggles to find a love and purpose and hope that can fill her up are moving and touching and altogether real.  <br /> <br />This is a challenging work, but it is a challenge worth meeting.	2005-06-26

Even McDougall isn't so sure about that. But he manages to find a path that hasn't been beaten down. <br /> <br />Where the tendency of American historians has been to find One Big Peg on which to hang their histories, McDougall pitches a big tent and tries hard to fit everybody under it. He works hard to tell the whole story without trying to shape it to lead to a particular moral. <br /> <br />For example, McDougall's approach to America's Christian roots. He doesn't try to minimize them and pretend that they weren't really there or didn't really matter, but neither does he try to elevate them into a thesis about Americans being God's Chosen People. He acknowledges them and presents them thoroughly without trying to shape them to prove something. <br /> <br />If McDougall has a point of view, it is that of a mild cynic. His one thesis is that Americans have always been hustlers in both senses of the word-- hard workers and scammers. This gives the work a tendency to shy away from Big Deep Ideas and philosophical cant. Where many historians have tried to layer American history in fancy clothes (This cigar is really a symbol of the repressed oppression of growing economic anti-humanistic struggling), this book leaves the impression of a more direct view (This is a cigar). <br /> <br />Beyond that, most of his organizational tools are about analysis rather than interpretation. His language is relaxed, cleasr and sometimes even colloquial, and his reach is considerable. There's a great deal of information here, but explained and organized so that the reader comes away with a clear view of a large picture. <br /> <br />If I were a high school history teacher, I'd be begging for sets of this book to teach from. A great and clear read.	2005-06-26

A fantastic book, with a story that a novelist would be proud to have invented. <br /> <br />However, the one rather large shortcoming of the book is the lack of photos. Larson creates a compelling, fascinating, suspenseful tale of the struggle to build the white city, but we can't see it. <br /> <br />So I recommend THE CHICAGO WORLD'S FAIR OF 1893 A Photographic Record with text by Stanley Applebaum, from Dover books (ISBN 0-486-23990-X) which has a fabulous assortment of photos of the completed fair. <br /> <br />Larson's juxtaposition of the race to create and run the giant Fair with the story of America's most horrific mass-murdered just a few blocks away is compelling and exciting. Larson is a great story teller and a thorough historian, and as many many people have already said, this is a book well worth reading. Just get some pictures so you can see it, too.	2005-06-26

He also does a great job of sketching in the principals as living, breathing characters. <br /> <br />At the center of this tale sit Jay Gould and Jim Fisk, an unlikely team-- one a stiff, and tightly self-controlled, the other a flamboyant high-roller who lived openly with his mistress. How they hatched a plot which nearly trashed the entire US economy is more adventure than detective story. <br /> <br />Ackerman has put his tale together with a good assortment of sources (once the gold scheme blew up, lots of people had lots to say, some of it in court), and he manages to give us just enough background for understanding without wandering off down some side street. And he shows how the fallout included the beginnings of federal regulations to protect the US economy. <br /> <br />Originally written in 1988, this is a great piece of work and a welcome reissue (though filled with an extraordinarily large number of typos). Highly recommended.	2005-06-26

Here we discover that he can also write history like a great short story writer.    McCullough fans will recognize some of the characters and material included here-- characters from Teddy Roosevelt's American West, the Roeblings of the Brooklyn Bridge, and some remarkable drawings that they left behind. These slightly familiar portions are a treat, like finding little \\"extras\\" left over from McCullough's other books.    But there are other characters here as well. Other writers like the extraordinary Harriet Beecher Stowe, whom everyone knows about, but not very much. Or Harry Caudill, a modern day lawyer who became an Appalachian activist. Some of them, like Alexander von Humbolt the South American explorer, will lead the reader to think first, \\"I've never heard of this person\\" and second, \\"Why haven't I?!\\"    Some of these are works of history; some are really works of journalism. And while all are loosely linked by themes of human courage and dedication, what really links them is that McCullough saw something important in these stories and so wrote about them.    This is a great book to introduce someone with a not-quite-a-whole-book attention span to top-notch historical writing. And for McCullough fans, it's a great chance to see his magazine writing collected.	2005-06-26

Finder's story, set after the first attack on the WTC, is a bit spooky in how it manages to anticipate some of what did occur years later. Details about the world of terrorism and counter-terrorism that may have seemed merely nice detail work originally now have a special kind of resonance. For that reason alone, this book would be worth a look.<br />But that's not all it has to offer. Finder combines the tech-savvy detail of Clancy with the personal drama and driving suspense of Ludlum. We get a whole cast of characters that are drawn well enough to engage us in the story without stopping the narrative push.<br />Action, surprises, twists and a grippingly real premise-- the book manages to entertain and give you something to think about when it's over. A great read. I can only hope that the release of Finder's new novel Paranoia will fuel interest in his earlier works so that this sees print again, because it deserves to be out there.	2004-02-16

Horwitz manages to see both Cook the heroic discoverer and Cook the harbinger of the destruction of non-western civilizations. He can also balance the sweep and majesty of his historical material with the detail and grit of ludicrous modern bar-hopping.<br />Along the way Horwitz manages to give shape and form to what most of us sort of half-remember about Cook, while uncovering new bits of hard information and interpretive insight. And all through he uses a the deft hand and keen eye of a journalist to bring it all alive.<br />It's witty and funny and informative and gripping and moving all at the same time, as if Spielberg directed a documentary written by the History Channel but cast with the correspondents of the Daily Show. This does what the best history writing can do-- engage you even if you didn't think you knew or cared about the subject in the first place.	2004-01-01

Mind you, that's not a bad thing. But this is not the usual King scarefest; it's one of his quieter works.<br />There's no Major Menace, no Big Scary Something that is threatening the characters. The biggest issue is really a more ordinary one-- will a young man recover from the untimely loss of his father?<br />There is the titular car-that-is-not-a-car that has periodically spit out otherworldly stuff, but nothing that has threatened life as we know it. It is a mystery, and one that King pointedly tells us he is not going to explain. <br />But mostly this is a meditation about how an older generation salvages those who come after and how we live with the Big Black Something out in the shed and whether we allow its unknowable, almost random, issuance to dominate our lives, or not.<br />It's a thoughtful work, very warm and human and skillfully structured. It's not particularly scary, but it does linger a bit on the psychic palate when it's done.	2004-01-01

It says something about this book that Michael Moore and Ariana Huffington both have blurbs on the back cover.<br />Maher's strength is that he hews to no particular party line. On one page he agrees with conservative right-wingers and a page later he's letting loose with a rant from the liberal playbook. The great thing about him is that he has an opinion, and he states it, and he doesn't worry about what box it all should be filed in. As such, he's a great antidote to the intellectual laziness of most of our pundits.<br />Given, that, you can expect that at least once in this book, you'll shake your head and think, &quot;No, that's just not right&quot; and on some other page you'll think, &quot;Dang-- that's exactly it.&quot; Maher cuts through a lot of the fuzz, smoke and mirrors of the post-9/11 political landscape , and even if you have to think a bit to figure out why you disagree with him, that's certainly more than any political figure has done in the last year.<br />Maher is not polite or nice, but every society needs someone who's willing to tell the fat girl that she shouldn't wear spandex.

It is one big honking book published in four chunks.<br />In pacing and plotting, it reminds me of a 100-issue run of a comic book. There's a continuously unfolding series of events, building out from the center, but not necessarily toward ever increasingly dramatic climaxes.<br />What Williams has done here is ingenious. He really hasn't created any new plot devices or directions; you'll see few things here that you've never ever seen before. What he has done is to combine them all.<br />Sure, we saw (for just one example) human minds wired into vast virtual reality in the Matrix, but we have no idea how they got there. Plenty of government conspiracies, plenty of power-mad scary guys. But ordinarily these works get fuzzy around the edges, and the writer asks us to accept that some things just ARE so he can get on with the main story.<br />What Williams does is shuffle these several different novels together and set them up to lean on each other. And where other authors follow a narrative thread only so far and then say, \\"Well, yeah, there's another story over there, but we don't have time for it, so come on back here,\\" Williams shows us all of everything, and shows us some combinations of plot elements that we might never have imagined.<br />If you like reading these multivolume works for the enormous drama and a payoff whose operatic grandeur is proportional to the page count, you may nod off around book three here. And the characters are moving and effective, few stick in your head weeks after you've finished the work. But what Williams gives us instead is a vast, far-ranging, multi-character, multi-multi-themed tapestry that is enormous in scope and which has to be walked over a section at a time.	2002-08-14

One of the things that is so engaging about the book is the breadth of his discussion (even Eminem and napster make appearances in this book).<br />There a points when the book becomes a discography in paragraph form and the straight-ahead listing of who recorded this next and when become a bit numbing. But at its best, the book gives you tidbits that surprise, pictures that enlighten, and a desire to run out and look for a particular recording of the songs you thought you knew so well.<br />Bottom line; if you think the idea behind the book sounds interesting, you'll like the book.	2002-08-14

Neither of the two cases is particularly engaging, and Kinsey herself doesn't seem to learn or grow this time out, and we don't really learn anything about her that we don't already know.<br />Grafton can still outwrite most of the detective writers around with one hand behind her back, but this outing is definitely a bit shorter on spark than the usual.	2002-08-14

But even if you don't care about Proper Behavior, this book is a great read. Miss Manners is a great writer; her work is pointed, sharp and funny. She has the gift of making me laugh out loud as I read about matters that I don't even care much about, and hardly a chapter went by without my learning something useful.<br />Someone wisely chose to include letters written to her column; it's in her byplay with her readers that she shines brightest.

But at the same time, it manages to support themes about technology, human evolution, and love and loyalty that are handled with as much thought and heft as any &quot;serious&quot; work.<br />The only gripe I've ever had with this book is that it ends way too soon, and in fact is screaming out for sequels that have never come. Not that the plot isn't fully wrapped up-- it's just that you hate to leave the company of these people who are so funny, profound, and warmly human. <br />This is a must-have book for any SF reader.	2002-02-09

But if you can't do that, the second best thing is to broadcast your bias loud and clear. <br />By going the second route, this book provides not only a historical account of the robber barons, but a pretty clear picture of the Marxist perspective on them in 1934. <br />It's interesting at times to watch Josephson struggle for balance. On the one hand, he seems to almost admire the big capitalists when they're creating collectives by crushing the little capitalists. On the other hand, when they start tromping on the workers, they're clearly Very Naughty. And he addresses the rampant religious fervor of most of the barons, but never really figures out how to make it fit the picture other than by suggesting they're just enormously hypocritical.<br />The story of railroad, steel and banking essentially taking over the country is here, nicely organized so that we can follow relevant threads without getting to caught up in chronology. Josephson sometimes lets his billowing prose and sweeping characterizations overwhelm detail and fact; his style is definitely not for all tastes.<br />Ultimately it's a double history, not only of the Robber Barons themselves, but of the singular vantage point of the mid-thirties. Yes, Josephson is not the most objective of chroniclers, but his bias is so clearly stated and in evidence that it is easy to filter out, and his point of view becomes an interesting subject of this study in its own right.	2002-01-29

On the surface, there's a simple suspense tale about a young girl and her brother caught in the grip of a profoundly dysfunctional family. Beyond that, it is a study in the faces and origins of evil, and how evil finds its way into people's lives. Do we invite it, does it charm its way in, or does it sneak up on us without our realizing it.<br />The narrator's mother is an intriguing character, a woman with a desire for love and a taste for self-destruction who brings mortal peril into her own home. Her son pines for a convicted killer that he's never met. <br />Some sweet quirky chracters, some twisted ones, a few surprising plot turns (though a couple perhaps not quite so surprising as the author expected) and a lovely poetic voice make this a good read.

At the same time he also provides a primer about Tibet and Chinese politics.

His voice is chatty and personal; this is like getting the story of civilzation from your Uncle Ed on the back porch.<br />How can you not love a book that includes lines like: &quot;There is no denying that philosophers' attempts to think clearly have often rudely backfired. (Any subject that is responsible for producing Heidegger, for example, owes the world an apology).&quot; <br />Gottlieb puts philosophy back into the study of the world, pointing out that philosophy gets a bad rap in part because as soon as a philospoher discovers something useful, such as planetary movement, he's reclassified a scientist.<br />This gives a great overview of some lesser-known philophers and provides a nice, clear picture of better-known thinkers such as Socrates and Plato. He's refreshingly clear of cant and doesn't appear to be intent on selling any particular school or point of view. This is great teaching in book form-- clear, understandable, and direct. <br />This is a great introduction to philosophy up to the Renaissance, and for those who are already familiar with the territory, it's a great work for putting everyone into place in the bigger picture.

Disaster seems to want to be a lively, fiction-style approach to the events, but suffers from a lack of depth and from the absence of any usable central characters. So we don't quite get a point of view strong enough to paint a compelling subjective experience, nor enough depth and detail to create a strong objective study. <br />Instead we land somewhere in between. Not a bad book, though some of the historic conclusions seem open to debate. It does have some nice little anecdotes, and can be read cover to cover in a light afternoon, so this might make a good overview or starting point for someone approaching the subject. Young readers would also find this handy.<br />If you want to see this type of historical writing done well, pick up David McCullough's book about the Johnstown Flood.	2001-06-10

But there is nothing else like this book out there; nothing else gives you such a thorough picture of how the business of music in the 20th century has affected what we hear and buy and listen to.<br />The whole century is here: how the ASCAP/BMI battle raged for years and influenced everything from swing recordings to attitudes about rock and roll; how records and juke boxes and radio and movies changed the way writers made money; how recording artists &quot;became&quot; composers. And yes, here's one more way in which the Beatles changed the face of popular music.<br />In some ways the book can be disheartening for those who always figured that the world of popular music was a true capitalist meritocracy. But as the battle over napster and the net rages, it's interesting to see how the gulf between writers, performers, and the public has ALWAYS been a horrible morass of money, power, laws, unwritten rules, and manipulation.<br />This is a work of thorough and inpeccable scholarship. It's as if he knew that no one else was going to try to tell this story, so he'd better include every last tidbit. Fascinating in its detail, amazing in its scope, this is a must-read work for any student of American popular music.	2001-02-25

Because the victim here is Kinsey's first husband, there's a fairly seamless mix of the mystery du jour and Kinsey backstory in this novel. The ystery itself unfolds nicely and with a minimum of sheer luck. The incidental characters are a nice mix, and Grafton manages the now rather hefty task of touching base with most all of the characters and elements that have been part of the series. And as always, Kinsey learns, suffers, grows, and comes face to face with more hard truths about herself. <br />After so many entries in the series, there is still more to know and love about this character, and the formula remains familiar but fresh. This is still one of the sharpest, snappiest gumshoes in the business. If you have enjoyed other novels in the series at all, this one will not disappoint.	2001-01-07

This is not one of those books.<br />Mostly this is an excuse to mount a medieval adventure tale. SF elements are fairly minimal, and much of this we've seen before (a money grubbing corporate guy who wants to use science to set up a lucrative entertainment event--gee, sounds familiar). The medieval adventure is finely detailed although every other page one of the protagonists is separated from the others, in mortal peril, etc etc etc. Pacing is relentless and unmoderated.<br />Sometimes Crichton can graft in ideas to give the work depth (chaos theory in Jurassic Park, dangers of technology in Congo) but there really aren't any ideas in this book other than the middle ages didn't suck as much as we've been told, but they were still plenty brutal.<br />So, not as good as Jurassic Park, but better than the execrable sequel.	2000-12-29

It doesn't tell you what to do, it doesn't preach, it doesn't prescribe-- what it does is provide a clear roadmap to territory that most of us find confusing and disorienting.<br />There are many stories and examples.

At first, Steinbeck merely  dips his feet in the waters. The first &quot;chapters&quot; are  nearly-exact &quot;translations&quot; of Mallory into modern English, with  very little added or taken away. Then, slowlby but surely, Steinbeck's  voice begins to emerge and he begins to not just translate but retell the  tales. Steinbeck grows into the task, telling the stories with greater and  great power, conviction, energy, excitement and style and then-- well, then  it just stops. For students of Mallory or Steinbeck, this is an interesting  work, a unique collaboration 500 years in the making. If you're looking for  a good version of the Matter of Britain, however, this will disappoint in  its incompleteness.	2000-09-15

RWE is one of the great articulators of the American  mind. For better or worse, here's a distilled vision of what we think.  RWE's positive and powerful view of human thought can be uplifting, though  some may occasionally experience a desire to snort &quot;Oh,  puh-lease!&quot;  A great source of pithy quotes and sharp insights, RWE  also provides considerable depth if you wade all the way into his works.

Now when I go back to this trilogy I'm amazed at what  a model of compact efficiency it is! (If only Robert Jordan could get to  the point this quickly). Some groundbreaking works don't age well; their  ideas are expanded and improved by those who come after. But Tolkein is a  scholar, a thinker, and a gifted writer, and no one who's copme along since  can handle this kind of material as well as he did. The writing is  beautifully crafted, the characters vivid, and the tale built on a solid  foundation of mythic story-telling. You read golden age SF so that you can  understand the roots of what came later, but you read the Lord of the Rings  because it's just that good. A timeless classic, this, so good that I'll  take the time to write this review even though it will probably go unread  and unclicked simply because this work DESERVES to have a boat-load of  glowing reviews attached.	2000-09-13

But the cumulative effect is to show just how harsh and difficult life in  the late 1700's could be. On that emotional level, this book is not unlike  the first twenty minutes of Saving Private Ryan. <br />Much of the events of  this novel take place right in my own neighborhood, and it's stirring to  realize how tough life was here at one time. We don't ordinarily associate  Pittsburgh, PA or Wheeling, WV with tough frontier life, yet here they  are.<br />Eckert remains for the most part very even-handed and unafraid to  show these people in their complexity-- heroic on one occasion, venal and  nasty on another. This is living, breathing history. Highly recommended.	2000-08-30

This is still a fun book. Byrne sometimes tries a bit too hard to be clever, and I particularly wish that when quoting tv shows or movies he showed the courtesy of citing that actual scriptwriter.<br />But these are quibbles. For about a half-cent per quote this is a good deal. There's something fun on every page, and the organizational approach of allowing one topic to flow into another related topic allows this to flow much better than other similar books (an index still lets you find particular quotes on demand).<br />If you enjoy this, Laurence Peter's Quotation collection is a somewhat higher quality work with the same sort of attitude.	2000-08-12

Leiber sees time travel ability as a step in the  development of the species, and puts that little philosophical gem into  this tight little piece. Not quite a novel (it really does read like a  stage play) this actually ends up as a bit of a whodunnit.<br />Characters put  the next stage of human development in the context of ordinary human  foibles and frailties, and as always Leiber is able to slip in some big  ideas without adding slack to the plot. Lord knows there are lots of  authors who could have ladeled on a hundred more pages of lard.<br />Yes, if  your idea of a time travel story is one more adventure of Biff Beefwhacker  battling it out with ancient giant ratbeasts, then this will disappoint. If  you think the time travel episodes of Star Trek make perfect sense, this  will probably hurt your head. But if you want a tightly written,  thoughtful, taut, tense, small scale adventure with large scale ideas  underneath, this is your book.	2000-08-11

Too much history and it's not  good fiction; too much fiction and it's unsatisfying history. Rutherford's  solution is to write large sprawling works that are really short story  cycles. In Sarum, he pulled it off beautifully, with nicely linked tales  that added up to a greater whole. Ruska didn't quite make it, and  ultimately comes across as barely related short stories featuring  characters with recycled names.<br />London splits the difference. Not quite  as tightly woven as sarum, but with more unity than Ruska, this series of  tales builds a detailed and impressive picture of London through the  centuries. It's peopled with a multitude of nicely drawn characters who  show their family ties and wear their family history well.<br />Rutherford has  a particularly fine eye for geography and architecture, and while it may  seem that the story occasionally sags while we take a short travelogue,  it's this attention to detail that is one of the book's great pleasures.  And Rutherford saves a neat little plotting device (reminiscent of  Michener's Centennial) to give some closure to the whole thing.<br />Think of  the city as the main character, keep one finger on the page with the  character's family trees (but try not to peek ahead!) and enjoy!	2000-08-08

The book has a sharp, sassy,  punchy, pointed sensibility (which only lags, unfortunately, in Dr. Peter's  own added asides which are uniformly below the standard of the rest of the  book). This is a quotation book that you will read cover to cover.

On the one hand, there's the writer of Twilight Zone-esque (before the TZ existed!) stories that are exciting or just plain creepy (The Illustrated Man, R Is For Rocket). On  the other hand, there's Bradbury the stylist, who can write page after page  of poetry in prose form (Dandelion Wine). Not everybody likes both.<br />But  in this novel the two Bradbury's meet. His love for boyhood, the beauty of  a small town, the love of a father are all captured in gorgeous writing  wrapped around a truly creepy tale. The Wonder Years meets Dracula? There's  really nothing else like this work: it can stand up right beside To Kill a  Mockingbird and a Tales From the Crypt collection.<br />Oh, and whatever you  do, don't watch the movie version.	2000-07-18

Here, as he did with the Fantastic Four, he not so much re-invents as clarifies the character. All of the fat and foolishness  is stripped away, and new details are added that fit so well that you  wonder how the feature went fifty years without them. Byrne is totally  respectful of what has come before, and yet makes it all fresh and new.  This is truly Superman reborn and reinvigorated.

This work has more in common with the adventures of Horatio Hornblower than Bilbo Baggins. Particularly in this first half of the duology, there's little hint of any fantastic elements whatsoever. The non-fantasy feel is  further accented by Russell's creation of a world that is so clear,  specific, and well-grounded.<br />There's politics, travel adventure, and a  bit of love(lust?) interest-- this could almost be a costume drama set in  18th century France! If you can relax and let this work take you where it  will without waiting for a big furry mgic something to pop up, the work has  some rewards-- strong characters, grown-up plot, intrigue, and sailing  adventures.

This is a great bedtime read-aloud book for younger kids. There's lots of characters (great chance  for some goofy voices, parents). and here, as in most of his books, the  adventure is somewhat picaresque so it's not to hard to take a break at the  end of chapters.

Cronon presents the history of Chicago and the midwest as the history of commodities and  trade. It's an interesting approach, and he shows the global implications  of many of his insights-- he correctly observes that much of what he  demonstrates with Chicago could also be shown with other cities as well.  Some of his insights didn't strike me as being nearly as unexpected as he  seems to think they are (the interdependence on commodities wholesalers and  their markets, for example), but most of his ideas are well-argued and  supported. Ultimately this is not so much about Chicago's history as it is  about using Chicago and the west as a case study to show how cities grow,  and how city and country are inter-related.	2000-06-27

Strong, stylish and effective graphics (think Alex Toth) merges with writing that mixes grand epic fantasy with strong character work and  riotous slapstick humor.

It is not even an up-to-date reading of what post-nuclear earth would look like; much more recent scientific speculation  contradicts some of the picture here.<br />But it does give you what Shute  does best-- ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. What would you  do if you knew that you, and every other human around you, were about to  relentlessly, unavoidably, painfully die? This is a powerful haunting  hopeless book, but for my money the most realistically frightening picture  of the end of human life ever set on the page.	2000-06-20

The &quot;sequel&quot; to that march in the town of Alice is an equally adept picture of how  ordinary humans rebuild life and beauty in the midst of strife and  emptiness. Some readers find the work structurally odd, thinking that Shute  has slapped together two stories that are only loosely linked by character,  but I find here a solidly unified tale, the story of a woman who descends  into the realm of death and despair and then marches back out again. It's  touching and inspiring and a reminder of what can be best in all of us, but  without being treacly or preachy.	2000-06-20

Never mind the racial elements-- they truly don't matter to Conrad's purpose. And do force yourself to work through every meaty, carefully drawn sentence. This work  is a model of compactness, a work in which every single line  counts.<br />Consider it as the Anti-Huck Finn-- Marlow travels up a river  (instead of down) and as he leaves more of civilization and restraint  behind, he becomes worse (instead of better). Compare it also to *Lord of  the Flies* (look, in particular, at LOTF last paragraph) as a treatment of  what lies within the deepest part of humans.<br />It's a challenging and  unsettling work, but it has great rewards both in writing and in the ideas  contained.	2000-06-18

This book lets you feel what  the sweep of American history felt like for ordinary folks in ordinary  towns. The detail is extraordinary yet not distracting, the drama moving  yet cut from the events of ordinary lives. There are no great literary  ambitions here-- Santmyer has no great point to hammer home other than,  &quot;This is how it was.&quot; But when the end of the book arrives, I  felt sad to leave behind these people that I had come to know so well. It's  not very often that you pick up a book this lengthy and leave it feeling  that it was somehow too short. Not a beach book, but a winter novel, to be  read wrapped up in a comforter with a mug of hot chocolate next to the  fire. If you missed this the first time it appeared, grab it now.	2000-06-18

On the one hand, we have the story of the westerners versus the evils of big business-- it's the  kind of grim social realism that many of the late-19th century Zola  followers produced, dramatically stirring and morally outraging. But in  this novel we also have the floridly romantic tale of the shepherd Vanamee  and his lost/reincarnated love.<br />In college I thought Norris was trying to  write a novel that actually combined the Romantic and Realist strains of  American literature. Later I wondered if this novel weren't the drawing  board prototype for magic realism. Whatever the case, I think Norris is not  just trying to send society a wake-up call; he is trying an ambitious  literary development as well. A stirring read and a fascinating display of  craft.	2000-05-29

For me, this work did not quite live up to that standard.<br />The history side is fine. Russia's history is pretty dramatic all by itself, and Rutherford manages  to get to most of the highlights one way or another. Maybe, though, the  canvas was just too big-- ultimately the work didn't quite hang together  for me as whole. The technique of multiple family lines becomes stretched  to the point of breaking. I felt as if I were reading several short books  that had no connection other than setting, that successive generations did  not build upon or add to those that preceded or followed them. The parts  never quite added up to a greater whole as they did in sarum.<br />Still glad  I read it, and I would still recommend it for its historical sweep, but he  did this better in sarum.	2000-05-29

SPHERE is a taut and engrossing thriller that grabs  you till the very last line. Oddly enough, these three works actually  require LESS intellectual gymnastics than his more lucrative works-- these  function quite well as adventure/thriller yarns.

Fuller's work provides a nice window into the 50-60's era of UFOology,  before we were paranoid and weirded out by the X-Files et al. At some times  these works may seem naively tame, at others just innocently silly, and I  suppose that if you are a True Believer, these should be required reading  as among the first works to take a look at UFO sightings through a  reasonably legit lens, rather than scribblings from the lunatic fringe.	2000-05-21

Haggard combines his two most bankable stars-- Ayesha and Quartermain-- and it ought to be twice as much fun. The problem ultimately is that we know from page one that nothing is going to happen that might conflict with  any of the history established for these characters in their other books.  Particularly in Ayesha's case that's mighty limiting-- we know that Allan  is going to pass through her life without making any particular mark,  because all the significant people in her life are already accounted for.  Consequently, the work doesn't really show anything new about either  character, and instead of two great prizefighters duking it out, we get a  couple of characters dancing around trying not to make a mark on each  other. Still the basic two-fisted Anglo-Saxon hambone adventure that  Haggard does so well, but there's a little less zip in this outing.	2000-05-18

For Lovecraft completists, this is a fascinating look  at what other sorts of work he could do when he chose to, but for folks who  love his better horror stories, this will come as rather a disappointment.	2000-05-18

On TV this woman impresses the living daylights right out of me. I approached this book with interest and high expectations-- maybe that was my problem.<br />Some of the book is highly practical, very useful indeed. The  exercises are good for providing focus and make a nice reference for later.  But as I worked my way through, I was increasingly distracted by the  authors constant presence in the book. I felt as if I were in a counseling  session with a mentor who mostly wanted to talk about herself. Again, may  have been part of my expectation problem-- had I picked this up as an  autobiography, I think I would have been very moved and inspired and  impressed. But as it was, I ultimately felt that the book's focus was badly  torn between the reader and the author.	2000-05-11

The more recent books are likewise good, but seem to have been trying a tad too hard. This is the one to start with. Like Miss Manners, Cecil transcends his material or subject  matter-- his sharp, witty voice is the real treat here. However, it should  also be noted that unlike most authors of trivia and odd-knowledge  compendiums, Cecil actually applies Real scholarship to his answers,  instead of the usual assortment of second-hand hearsay. A great gift for  the smartass on your list...	2000-05-11

Multiple plots and personalities weave tightly through the work, and just when you think that the novel is nothing but a big pile of disconnected  pieces, Cozzens turns just a couple of corners and the whole things snaps  into place in a stunning moment of revelation. It's masterful craft, and  both emotionally and intellectually moving.<br />On top of that, Cozzens  manages to write for grownups in a world where compromise, settling, and  just muddling through are sometimes as heroic as it gets-- sacrifices must  be made, and it's NOT always a bad thing. If you find Steinbeck a tad too  mushy, Hemmingway too mannered and ballsy, and Fitzgerald too melodramatic,  this underappreciated author may be for you, and this novel is a great  place to start.	2000-05-11

How can anyone manage to create so many vivid, original characters in such a small space? This is the kind of  beautiful and exciting story that can ONLY be told in print; as visual and  striking as this work is, it could never be properly realized on film. The  second book is not properly a sequel, but really the rest of this work--  save time and buy it at the same time.	2000-05-09

This book stands out from the pack for two reasons: first, the attention to detail and character that brings  these men alive in all their human strength and frailty; second, the  absolutely stunning photography. You will find yourself paging through this  book again and again, taking in the images here, both terrible and  beautiful all at once.	2000-05-09

Everyone remembers that they burn books in this novel-- what they forget is why. Bradbury's world is one where-- --anything  that might offend any special group is repressed --anything that might  require people to think is repressed --people sit and stare endlessly at  wall-sized tv's --suicide is rampant and unremarkable --people lead life at  breakneck speed to avoid thinking or feeling In short, Bradbury has created  a world which is frighteningly close to the one in which we live. Even if  you THINK you remember this work, it is time to reread it. Book burning is  by far the least scary prediction Bradbury has made here.	2000-05-08

This is &quot;human literature&quot; at its finest, writing that most authors only dream of on their best days. Images, colors,  character-- there is always more to find in this work, always more to  unpeel and discover. Characters are complicated and layered; no &quot;good  guy&quot; or &quot;bad guy&quot; notions fit here. The plot weaves spins,  turns back on itself, twists and surprises-- the quality of story-telling  alone makes this book worth your while. Its rewards are numerous and deep.	2000-05-08

What can we call this-- romantic satirical physics fiction? There's a cute little love  story, some sharp satire from the world of research science, some nice  application of chaos theory and, well, not much else.  Ultimately this is  fluff, but well written, well informed, and funny fluff.	2000-05-05

A bit darker than Narnia, easier to grasp than Middle Earth, this is thrilling stuff-- I can still remember tha chills I got during the  climactic scenes of this book long ago. A great read from a terribly  under-appreciated author...	2000-04-11

This is one of Laumer's best, with a nice balance between his silly and his  serious sides. Highly recommended-- hope it's back in print soon.	2000-04-11

But although people refer to this work as Dickensian, it is better than that. Most incredibly, this twisted convoluted intricate plot makes sense without resorting to Dickens's usual  coincidence and accident. Moreover, there is a psychological darkness and  depth here that Dickens never quite touched.	2000-02-27

When I was done, I didn't know whether I wanted to give Chaplin a big hug or slap him upside the head. This is a tale of what happens when irresponsible romanticism meets harsh reality. When it's  all done, you don't know if Chaplin really learned or understands anything,  yet at the same time, you know the depth of his culpability because he has  told you himself. I don't know if it's possible to write with complete  honesty about one's own part in such horrific events, but he certainly  gives it a shot. This book is quite an unusual and moving read.	2000-01-21

His voice is personal and open, so you're free to accept or reject his personal attitudes which are in plain sight, rather than hidden in some  musty scholarly construct. A bright, enjoyable and enlightening work.	1999-06-21

Sills does a great job of laying out the territory in a plain and easily understandable manner; so much of the romance landscape makes sense with the perspective that her  work provides. And like Excess Baggage (her other must read work), this  book gives you the understanding you need to chart your own course; no  preaching or judging, just a clearer understanding that can only lead to  better choices.	1999-04-14

The language is gorgeous and awe-inspiring; the dense beauty of poetry combined with relentless story-telling. I feel (and I must use presente tense because one is never entirely done reading these works) riveted to scene after scene, hypnotized by the sheer beauty of the images, and yet compelled to move on and watch the story unfold. Lord of the Rings is juvenile compared to this. MYST is a child's crayon sketch compared to this. It is the most hauntingly beautiful work I have ever read	1997-09-08

The implications are wide-ranging and profound, yet applicable on a day to day basis; there is more to the universe than the simple winding down of entropy, and disorder and chaos are not necessarily the enemy	1997-09-08

Where other self-help classics catch a piece of the internal puzzle, Sills somehow sees the greater picture. Most importantly, Sills understands that basic human truth-- that what we are is sometimes our greatest blessing and sometimes our greatest curse. The book offers understanding and practical advice for finding balance, rather than offering abstract notions for &quot;fixing&quot; some personality flaw. Buy this book and Scott Peck's The Road Not Taken, and you won't need any other self-help book in the store	1997-09-08

If you found the brief (semi-accurate) glimpse of Chaos theory in Jurassic Park intriguing, this is your path to deeper understanding. This is completely accessible to the layman, and so profound in its implications that it should be required reading. The basic asumption of our era, that knowing enough, understanding enough, would make the universe perfectly predictable and our systems absoluterly efficient, is so clearly destroyed by this work that you will never look at the world the same again	1997-09-08
