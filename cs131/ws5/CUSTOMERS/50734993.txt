I am certain the author can't have been too happy with anything but the money he got.  For one thing, it is totally wrong for a therapist to sleep with her patient.<BR>Streisand, who has always purported to be so sensitive to social issues, should have known that this is  a no-no.  <br />I can't help thinking that she made the movie to show off her manicure.

There's some great storytelling  mixed in with the overwrought, purple prose. <br />My favorite character was the Great Dog Chippy.  The male banter is pretty cute, too.  <br />The first part of the book was simplistic, especially the<BR>stereotypical depictions of girls and women, all of whom seem to have stepped out of Seventeen or Vogue.  However, the descriptions of Rome and Venice were brilliant.  Also, lovingly woven in are descriptions of luscious meals created by the food/travel critic-narrator.<br />Still, you have to get by this to be treated to some of the most<BR>fascinating and harrowing stories you'll ever read in any book.  This is Conroy's forte...the individual stories. <br />As a Jew, I was both touched and embarrassed by Conroy's interepretation of Holocaust history and Jewish culture.  It's always a bit strange to hear your experience described in detail by someone who hasn't actually lived it...I suppose it's how some Black people feel when a Caucasion writes about Black culture.  Still, it had its interesting moments. Of course, it's always suspicious when the Jews (or Blacks) are depicted as Huge Heroes and Heroines (as in Max, the \\"Great Jew.\\")  It makes them outsized, and to some degree eradicates their normalcy , their ordinariness as simple human beings... <br />But then, everyone in this novel is out-size...larger than life. That's one of the problems with the book.  Every single person and thing is huge, including the fish.  If you will note from another great novel, \\"Moby Dick\\" - the only giants were  Ahab and the whale.  That kind of put things in perspective.<br />Still, a noble attempt and for the sheer joy of great storytelling, it's a \\"must\\" read.	2002-07-15

I did not care for the author's writing style.  It felt stilted.<BR>His sentences are start-stop-jumbled.  I don't know.  It<BR>just didn't work for me.<br />I found the portrayal of the women's friendship interesting.<BR>It supports the theory that Lee Oswald acted alone in the shooting of JFK and I do believe he was ONE assassin.  I think he was set up by others...that someone else \\"helped\\" to  make sure Kennedy was killed, and that Oswald would<BR>be the fall-guy because his position in the Book Repository was so high-profile.  <br />What I found weird was the author's attempt to \\"clear\\" Ruth<BR>Paine when I wasn't aware any of us thought she was responsible for anything in the first place.  I do believe the author wrote this book because he knows Ruth Paine and/or her family, and, with his agent, realized they could milk a good celebrity book out that friendship/aquaintance.  <br />I also found it weird that Ruth was so persistent in her pursuit of Marina Oswald, and that the author would make it seem that Paine was a good friend, caring person or at the very least sweetly naive because of this, when I see it as foolishness and co-dependency.  It is just downright stupid to think that Marina Oswald was a free agent right after the assassination.  She was besieged, surrounded on all sides by law enforcement of every stripe and lawyers, managers, <BR>Oswald's family, the media, etc., etc.  Why couldn't Ruth Paine understand this sea change and go with the flow?  Didn't she know that she would probably be the last person in the world Marina Oswald would want to see...someone who had witnessed her shame as a poverty-striken immigrant and abused wife pre-assassination?  Surely, Marina must have been feeling enraged and abandoned by Oswald.  She would not want close witnesses to her betrayal as friends.  <br />Whatever.  I did not find this book as interesting as I'd hoped.	2002-07-14

The best part of this book is the first...re. the tragic death of<BR>his daughter at the hands of a monster...and the subsequent failure of the law... another monster, in this book...to offer up true justice for the crime.<br />All that said, Dunne seems pretentious to me, as a journalist, as  writer.  To begin with, most of the stuff in this book, as another reviewer has pointed out, has been dealt with  by Mr. Dunne ad nauseum in Vanity Fair already.  I, too, was hoping for some fresh insights. Nada.<br />Second, I can't believe Vanity Fair or any of his other publishers don't notice that, in so many of the cases he writes about, he exhibits absolutely no journalistic objectivity<BR>whatsoever...it's just all his personal blather about brittle people.<br />He comes across as a celebrity boot-licker (despite his protestations that he is an \\"outsider).  He flatters himself.<BR>In fact, he's a rather mediocre \\"insider\\" like most of the people he writes about. And he's not near the writer that Truman Capote, another celebrity hound, was.  At least Capote was a poet.  Dunne seems to be simply a \\"tattler\\" of sorts, and a rather peevish one at that.  He's always having a hissy fit about someone snubbing him or insulting him .  Give me a break.  He's so snotty, pretending to be an<BR>intellectual; I can understand why a lot of people would shun him.

And here's the funny thing: I happen to agree with most of his views on the topcs he writes about, so I'm not some \\"secret Kennedy\\" sneaking in a bad review.  Don't get up on your high horse over that, Mr. Dunne.  No, I am simply an amused reader who can't believe Vanity Fair would allow such...to take  a prominent position in their pages.<br />And, then, too, also I must admit that I turn to his column first thing every month becauseI want to see what socialite(s) he is pretending to turn into chopped liver...when what he is really doing is giving them inordinate publicity for their shallow shtick...and his...	2002-07-02

When<BR>two people are having a private conversation that concerns only those two people...it is not necessary to repeat their full names again and again.  One need write only , &quot;she said,&quot; not &quot;Vivian Bauer said...&quot; once we KNOW it's Vivian who is<BR>speaking.   It's a sort of  Hemingway-ish thing to do, and it was one of the more mannered, contrived aspects of the great writer's work, too.  <br />The sheriff was exasperating in his willingness to do anything to anyone to support an outright lie. Much of this did not make sense to me.  I didn't feel his motivation was supported...I didn't feel I knew the town all that well to make the judgement that it was too fragile and insulated to be able to accept what in my mind was not that huge a scandal.  I mean, the dead girl was eighteen, no longer really a child, though the sheriff referred to her that way.  And the principal, Leo Bauer, was too removed for the reader to feel what he was truly all about.  And the wife, Vivian, was a sort of male ideal of womanhood...she just never seemed very real to me...an alabaster statue.  It did not seem plausible to  me that Jack would leave his beloved child Angela to take up with her.  Also, I didn't really get a handle on his relationship with his own wife, ony that he hadn't really &quot;seen&quot; her for years.  But why?  Why had they drifted apart?  And whose fault was it, mostly?  Jack's or Norah's?  <br />Frankly, I didn't think the novel was very complimentary to women.  They were either ugly or ideally beautiful; as a woman, I didn't identify with any of them.<br />Still, it was a poetic attempt.  There were some lovely<BR>descriptions of the countryside.  And I think it would make<BR>a dynamite movie, with someone like Will Patton in the lead.<br />If this writer overcomes his stilted literary stylization, he could turn out a masterpiece like &quot;Affliction&quot; by Russell Banks, another novel about a small-town cop gone &quot;bad.&quot;  He needs to &quot;write loose&quot; - let go and let the wind take him, instead of trying to control the words.  He's already good, but he could be better.  This review is meant to encourage.  I think Watson has a great book in him.  Let go and let God, Larry...	2002-06-21

What's sad is that you know someone (the author?) worked very hard to produce this book, but it's kind of empty and charmless.  The characters are all rather boring, plodding, prosaic.  The visualizations are so lacking that it's hard to get a fix on them.  I recommend that the author re-read her Dickens, for a lesson in descriptive characterization.<br />It does have a rather odd ending.  So much unbelievable convolution...in a way, it was fun following the author around as she tried desperately to bring it to some sort of conclusion.  I have a feeling she didn't have a clue how it would end when she began it, which can make things difficult for a writer.  Though a book takes its own strange twists and turns, it helps to have a sound denoument in mind.  This had  an implausible ending, but hey - you won't lose much sleep worrying over it.<br />I suppose she needed a new swimming pool, or aluminum siding for her country house, and the advance from such a book brought in the money...had to be that, cause what else is the point?	2002-06-19

Now I can't wait to read the others in the  Skip Langdon series.  To begin with, she's a fabulous invention...nothing conventional about Skip.  I imagine every woman who weighs more than the Vogue ideal will adore her.  I must say, I thought another good title  would have been...\\"Is Everyone In New Orleans a Drag Queen?\\" but I guess that would be considered too long.  Anyway, for the film,  I'd choose Ru Paul to play Skip, and the transvestite (sorry, forget her name) from \\"Midnite in the Garden of Good and Evil\\" to play Marcelle and Henry (different outfits, of course).

He gives voice to Kent's arduous tale, and I wish them both well.<br />Sante Kimes is, in my opinion, the most evil human being (besides Hitler and his SS gestapo) that I have ever heard about.  In the book it is stated that she's been considered right up there with Charles Manson, and though I have no love for that hideous maniac, it is the sheer lifelong weight of Sante Kimes's criminality that tips the scale in her favor.  What an ugly, ugly woman, inside and out.  I know she is supposed to have been \\"beautiful,\\" but when I looked at that picture of her as a very young girl, I saw in her eyes sly villany and a maniacal intention to harm.

If you liked \\"Tara Road,\\" another working-class-to-<BR>yuppie novel, you'll like this book. What's so amazing about it is the breadth and scope of the book. It also reminded me<BR>(please forgive me, Ms. Campbell) of \\"Gone With the Wind\\" in that it just went on and on and on, with one fascinating character after another. It's an epic soap opera! In fact, some Hollywood movie or TV producer is going to get smart and realize that it would make incredibly entertaining viewing.<br />The only problem is the ending. ... I [feel] it just got tied up too sweetly and conveniently - a sort of rush job to get it over with, perhaps.<BR>It also gushed too much at the end. Most of the way through, the characters were marvelously dark and dysfunctional, but all of a sudden, everybody got spiritualized and therapized and a good time was had by all. Excuse me, but life just ain't that simple. And we had all that \\"sermonizing\\" by a fading Hosannah at the end. Urp.<br />Also: I gotta say this, and I am sure many will disagree with me. The final \\"business deal\\" between Gilda Cosmetics and Mooney, Big Monty and Matriece buying \\"Brown Sugar\\" -<BR>ah - it just didn't cut it. Anything based on the foundation of blackmail just is not the spiritual way of doing things. You can say that an African American has to \\"build a callous around the heart\\" as Mooney taught Hosannah to do, but I thought Matriece might just be strong enough and centered enough not to need to play that game. I thought there was going to be more of a focus on forgiveness leading to true freedom. <br />And tell me this: if Matriece was such a dynamo, and those men had so much money to invest, why the heck did they have any need at all to pay Gilda ANYTHING for what they wanted to do? They didn't need \\"Brown Sugar.\\" Matriece, being the creative woman she was, easily could have come up with a whole new line and whole new way of doin' it.<BR>Frankly, this last bit of hooey proved to me that most novelists are not business people themselves (although I happen to be one). It just didn't make sense. I think if Ms. Campbell had consulted a businesswoman on this point, she would have had a different ending. Here's what I think is a more likely one:<br />Matriece finds out from Mooney and/or Kent about the business contract between her mother and Gilda. Being a highly ethical woman who doesn't need men to back her up in her career moves, she rejects their proposition of a \\"triumverate.\\" She tells them she will not stand for blackmail in any form. Instead, she takes her chances and approaches Gilda herself with the information. She does not blackmail her - she merely demands her due. However, she is prepared to SUE Gilda if necessary. <br />Gilda, feeling so guilty (hmm - good name play, Bebe) is only too happy to give Matriece just about whatever she wants. Does she want to be co-president, owning half of Gilda Cosmetics, along with Daniel? Does she want financial reparations so that she can start her own company? I'd be willing to bet that a smartie like Matriece would choose the latter - she wouldn't want to be draggin' around with Gilda's son - the Prince. So she takes the three or four million dollars (or more) that Gilda offers, and starts a totally new company, offering Internet access and a host of African American divas, from Asia Pace to Naomi Campbell, the author's long-lost relative. But maybe I, too, am straining your credulity...	2002-04-15

And I became amused by<BR>the novelization of artists' lives, because there, too, I felt<BR>the artist was secondary to the work.<br />However, this book is, truly, a pearl...it captures beautifully the  concept of how a work of art is conceived...of how the<BR>artist's imagination is separate from his or her every day life.<br />I was particularly gratified that the author &quot;got&quot; that an artist<BR>will rarely use those closest to him/her as subject matter.  <BR>And that can be a no-win situation.  I know wives and lovers<BR>who have appeared in the artist's works, and they are angered overexposure.

I wanted to experience more of him as he got closer to being uncovered, but you actually got further away.  And when they caught him, cowering in his office, well, that was kind of a quickie-let-down, then you had him escaping and chased by Marshall and blah-blah-blah.  Not ingenious enough.

The chapters just leading up to and around the rape are intriguing.  She's always good at the \\"dark\\" side.  The father's banishment of the daughter, while unpalatable and rather unbelievable, had enough drama to  make me want to keep going.  <br />But the cornball stuff made me gag.  Joyce: haven't you heard that saccharine is bad for your health?  There are too many sentimental cliches - it's like she was trying to prove that even she, the great JCO, can be a upbeat writer.  Please, leave that \\"perky\\" stuff to writers of sitcoms, Joyce.  You wasted a lot of time waving the flag, apple pie, \\"moms,\\" deposed cheerleaders and fluffy kittens around.  Can we get back to black now?<br />(Seriously, the problem here was that the family was so irritatingly \\"perfect\\" to begin with.

This is like one of those disappointingly self-indulgent Stephen King novels you keep trying to find the &quot;real&quot; book in, and by the time you're finished you're exhausted and wonder why you wasted so many hours wading through it.<br />In fact, this book reads more like Stephen King than Clive Barker...it has a mundane quality to it. Now, I love Stephen King, but he can (usually) carry off the mundane - he's wittier at it. Barker is wittier at the fantasy stuff. By trying to tackle &quot;ordinary&quot; characters like Tod and Tammy he just doesn't make it.

The men all acted  just about the same, know what I mean?  Always repeating themselves and acting like they were the Big Cheese and such.  Also, it was quite a bit of amusement hearing about Prohibition, what it was really like, if you get my meaning. How people in the Big Little Cities like Zenith defended it but in private couldn't wait to get their hands on a bottle of gin and go on about their Rights and Liberties, by golly, and how nobody had the right to tell them what to do in their own homes and in America and such.

Very juicily-written swamp-saga, with yummy, Faulknerian characters and a detective who should be played by  Russell Crowe if it's made into a movie.  Loved it, but had to ask, throughout: is Ms. Williamson a fan of James Lee Burke?  Check it out:  Burke's detective is Dave Robicheau, hers is Damon Rourke; Burke's detective's wife is dead and he's the father of a small girl (so is Rourke); Robicheau's partner disappeared, was believed dead - Rourke's, too.  Remi LeLourie is the most beautiful, sexiest woman in the world - so is every woman Robicheau has ever wedded or bedded.  Oh.  That's a standard guy-thing.  But it's MS. Williamson, n'est-ce pas? <br />Anyway, even if she has copied Burke's plot-and-character-lines, it's still a fab story I didn't want to stop reading, and of course it takes place in the whoring twenties, with lots of history about New Orleans so it's well worth the ride.	2001-06-22

For some reason, my thoughts kept returning to William Whyte's famous sociological treatise: &quot;Street Corner Society.&quot;  This is an updated version of American Life.  Excellently written in that  you can just zip through it - the writing doesn't hold you back.  <br />Also, it puts a new spin on the recent school murders.  I found that I had discounted the &quot;jock v. nerds&quot; issue that has  so often been claimed as a factor in the killings.  I will now, probably, take such complaints more seriously.  One has to wonder if such a terrible occurrence would be likely to happen in Glen Ridge today?  Not that the gang rape of an innocent young woman isn't a terrible occurence.  It just seems to me that in reaction to the &quot;jockocracy&quot; some of the other students today might resort to violence as a way of getting attention from the complicit school system and town leaders.<br />In any case, Lefkowitz, like Whyte, has given us a lasting model for our education about  social patterns in certain American towns.

I first read it when I was in my early twenties; now I am fifty and it is as exquisite as ever, and influencing me just as much as it did in my youth.<br />It is the mysterious, hushed intimacy of the book; the perfect dialogue of grieving people; the child's view of huge loss; the minute-by-minute telling of a story that must unfold slowly.

She was a hoot - had a great sense of humor about all the squalid things happening around her.  I did not find her mother as objectionable as the bookcover blurb implied, either.  However, I did find the characterization of the mother one of the book's flaws.  I just couldn't &quot;see&quot; her, for all of Ruth's talking about her.  Maybe it's because she did just that - talk ABOUT her.  She was just too  much of a cartoon for me - not human enough.  Still, that didn't spoil the book for me.<br />As for the previous reviewer who complained about Ruth's (and Hamilton's) jaundiced views on organized religion: MORE POWER TO THEM!  Praise God (who is probably amused as Hell by organized religion) for Great Writers.  Most of them, throughout history, have presented us with a clear view of the sham  - the hypocrisy, the abuse of power, the ignorance bred in the institution.<br />After having seen the movie version of (and then read the book of &quot;Map of The World&quot; ) I am a real fan of this author and look forward to everything else she brings us in the future.	2001-01-04

Vinegar Hill is one of the best works I've read this year.  The author should be congratulated on her outstanding achievement.  <br />Yes, the readers who complained about the book being &quot;bleak&quot; or &quot;whiney&quot; did miss something: the growing awareness of the intelligent, far-from-whiney heroine, Ellen, who finally comes into her own at the end of the book.  This does NOT have an unhappy ending.  In fact, the ending is absolutely exquisite, but I will not give it away here.<br />It is a book about abuse - handed down from a despicable man to his entire family.  His wife - Mary Margaret - is what I like to call a &quot;swamp&quot; - you could get lost in her bitterness, her cynicism, her bigotry, her hypochondria.  Yes, she, too, is a product of abuse, but that doesn't excuse her manipulative, self-serving, constant diatribe that poisons the air around her.  <br />Nevertheless, Ellen is a fairly objective observer in all this mayhem.  She is like a swimmer, trying to break the surface so she can breath.  Finally, she does, and it is such a welcome moment.  I just loved her for her backbone - and her compassion even for her nasty in-laws.  Every character is drawn beautifully.<br />This is a great women's book.  What happened to the women of this country being grateful for a glimpse into a real woman's life?  Guess what, critics?  Abuse of women and children still exists.  It seems there is some kind of backlash going on, a return to the former women-hating-women routine pre-Women's Movement.  I, for one, can't have too many books about women - their joys, their struggles.  I, too, have some criticism of Oprah's Book Club, but not because she chooses books that portray women's issues.  That's one of the best things about her choices.  Let's get together again, my women friends, not tear each other down.	2000-11-06

I really liked it - it shows us Sinatra the human being, which isn't what you usually get with these kinds of books.  <br />Tina doesn't hide her feelings.  She's completely honest about everything, including her relationship with her father's last, greedy wife.<br />I felt very close to Tina with this book.  My dad was also an ambitious, charistmatic Sagittarian, irresponsible but child-loving.  He set us up with a lot of ambivalent feelings about him and marriage and money, and in the end was married to a woman who hated his children and tried to sequester  him when he was dying.  I, too, have a lot of guilt about not being with my father when he died in the hospital.  And my step-mother had the same name as Tina's!  <br />So many of the conversations Tina had with her dad echoed mine with my father! Thanks, Tina.  There aren't many father-daughter stories, and this one hit home.	2000-11-02

Frankly, the more I read this book, the more I realized that the protagonist's character is not that different from any teenager chafing under the rules and regulations of not only strict - but unhappy, neurotic, co-dependent - call them what you will - parents. Can most people say they haven't been there, whether they are from upstate New York, China or Timbuctu?  <br />I loved every litle detail.   I learned a lot.  I thought she was very compassionate toward her family, too, despite her (justifable) rage.  She understood her mother's frustrations, her father's irresponsible dreaminess, though she didn't always like them.<br />There is in everyone's life a moment when being a daughter or son becomes an impossible thing - you just can't live with the family's image or ideas of what you should be or do.  That is when we break the bonds and become our own people.  Sometimes it's tragic, sometimes it's merely uncomfortable.  But it rarely comes without somebody suffering from the separation.  This is a coming of age story, as I saw it.  A Hasidic &quot;Catcher In The Rye.&quot;  I loved it.  Talented writer.	2000-10-30

I got confused sometimes with the jumping around between the two &quot;abductions.&quot;  By the end of the book I really didn't care any more.  The so-called &quot;twist&quot; at the end was a bit too out of the blue - frankly, I was dis- appointed.  A lot of it was implausible to me.  It's like he tried to throw in everything but the kitchen sink - and it sank.<br />However, some childhood memories with Bank were quite good, and all in all it's a book about fathers and daughters, and lifelong friends.  For those things, it worked, and so I held on because it's not a subject men write about too much and I wanted to find out what this author had to say about it.  <br />My favorite character, actually, was Naomi, Max's daughter.  She was spunky and gutsy and just weird enough to be a real person.  Too bad people have to write &quot;thrillers&quot; to have their books sell.  Can't one man just write about a father-daughter relationship, period?  Oh, well.<br />Not a bad book, just not a great one.  There were some clunky passages - and some smooth, poetic ones.  Uneven.	2000-10-30

I've never read anything by this author before and was pleasantly surprised to discover her.  I thought this was a brilliantly-written novel.  For me, good characters make for good reading and this novel is chock full of them, even' the dead ones - the &quot;ghosts&quot; in the machine, so to speak.<br />I must say the plot was a bit convoluted, and I felt myself constantly pushing away cobwebs to get back to it, but the characters - especially Terry, the 14-year-old 'derelict' and his mentor, the kind of anti-hero, Michael Deacon - kept me turning pages.  I loved the old Jewish lawyer and the pudgy pervert and photo expert.  Everyone had flaws, pecadillos, like real people.  I am so sick of these novels in which people are sort of romanticized, or glorified.  This one is, in the parlance of media hype, &quot;gritty.&quot;  PBS should do it.  It would provide work for a number of fantastic British actors.  <br />]	2000-10-13

This could become a classic.  I really felt everything he  wrote about.  I felt badly for him - his childhood was rather bleak.  However, his intelligence and good humor won the day and he has become a successful person, as a writer, in  academia and his personal, family life.  To me this shows  that unique situations often produce unique people, and in this there is hopefulness for those of us who feel we grew up as &quot;outsiders.&quot;  Frankly, I think everyone fits into that category one way or another, so I recommend this book to...everyone.	2000-10-13

I guess we all have our specific tastes.  I gave the book two stars for effort - maybe mine.  About halfway through I just couldn't stand it any more.  I found just about all the characters impossible cliches - the feisty newspaper heiress, the beautiful, steel magnolia prom queen, the noble parents, the saintly Black &quot;mammy.&quot;  Oh, give me a break.  The only character I vaguely responded to was the villain, Presley - he was a (minor) hoot.<br />Problems: 1, Too much speechifying, about race, the prom queen, the law.  I need to experience with a writer, not be talked-to. 2.  Little or no wit.  It wasn't a downer, merely flat.  I like a book with humor; with &quot;juice.&quot;  <br />If you want  to read a great book about the law, about causes, about love, check out &quot;Waking The Dead&quot; by Scott Spencer.  Also: &quot;Brainstorm&quot; by Richard Dooling.  These books are not labored sermons but sharp, cutting-edge, hilarious (but with serious themes) and in the case of Spencer's book, soulful.<br />I saw some women's critiques here, but I'm pretty sure  &quot;The Quiet Game&quot; is a &quot;guy-book.&quot;  It kind of just saws away, if you know what I mean.	2000-10-06

You can read this book in a day or two, and in some ways that's what makes it good.  Battered women may need something like this, to the point but it doesn't require too much energy to wade through. No page-after-page of statistics, etc.  <br />I liked the author, her direct, no-holds-barred attitude.  She tells it like it is and that is no small feat.  She has suffered. First she was emotionally abused by her father, then her husband.  I thought she was very balanced in her presentation.  She shows how she was a magnet for these kinds of men and how she has recovered from her need to both &quot;play&quot; the victim and exert neurotic control by being such a goody two-shoes.<br /> I'm so glad she has a peaceful life now, with a loving man.  That's good for battered women to see - that it is possible to love again.<br />And I think all women should be grateful that she was willing to put her life on the line  (literally, because, after all, her abuser is still, unfortunately, among the living) for others.

Yes, Judge Stang is one of the funniest characters I have ever come across in a novel - heck, all the characters are brilliantly drawn.  This guy is a super writer.  I am a writer myself, and I must admit to being a little jealous of his witty ease with words.<br /> I learned a lot about computers and biological and social anthropology.  But mostly, I laughed.

I, too, like the classical writers, as one rather pretentious reviewer indicated below, comparing some tried-and-true old frumps to the  deliciously contemporary Rachel Cusk.<br />This is a novel with CHARM and WIT  and experiential consciousness-raising about  disabilities.  It's a love  story, really, between Stella and Martin, who learn so much from each  other.<br />But I absolutely adored all the other characters - every single  one: the self-absorbed Pamela, her equally spacey house-husband and country  squire  Piers, their narcissistic, gorgeous son, Toby and their petulant  daughter Caroline.  Not to mention the strange-looking and randy Mr.  Trimmer.<br />What I particularly loved is that nothing ever turns out to be  what Stella expects.  Just when she thinks Martin's gossipy,  bossy teacher  is a lonely old-maid she finds out that the woman is actually a married  swinger!  Just when she thinks Pamela is snobbish, Pamela turns out to be  broad-minded.  Just when she thinks the old &quot;creature&quot; at the  post-office is about to do her in, he/she/whatever heals Stella's sunburn  and makes her happy again.  <br />The characters are at once dysfunctional and   adorable - like most people.  It's the rare author who can convey this  universal contradiction.  Jane Austen did it and it was this compassion for  the human condition that made her one of our greatest writers.<br />I just  wish this book had gone on and on forever.  I want sequels!  I want a  movie!  I want a PBS adaptation!  Thanks to the author for one of the more  pleasant weeks of my life.	2000-08-21

I barely noticed any editing problems, either,  and usually I do. I thought the book was beautifully presented.  She has  amazing recall and I don't doubt her memories because the story rings far  too true.  The dream sequences are sad beyond imagining.  I had a hard time  reading for any duration because it wasjust too horrific.  Nevertheless, I   kept wanting more. A brilliant effort and hopefully one that many will read  so that we don't forget.

This has all the earmarks of a prize-winning Great American Novel, right  up there with Richard Ford's 'Independence Day,' Russell Banks's  &quot;Affliction&quot; and Mary McGarry Morris's &quot;Vanished.&quot;   <br />I loved this book.  I, too, relish certain scenes.  A lovemaking scene  in particular stands out.  His descriptions are among the best in this area  that I have ever read: muscular, nearly sculptural.  The scene in the  restaurant when Fielding announces that he believes he is having a nervous  breakdown: I found myself very moved - to tears.  In fact, I cried several  times during the reading of this book, which incorporates so many elements  of life: the poitical and the personal,  on so many levels!<br />The reason I  mentioned that it should win a Pulitzer is because it tackles a  particularly important moment in American history: the dividing line  between social conscience at its compassionate best and crazy worst and  materialism at its heady best and greedy worst.  I loved that it ended with  Fielding reading the word &quot;help&quot; in one of the letters from a  member of his constituency.  You know that there is plenty of good work for  him to do, just as his true love, Sarah, was doing hers. <br />Great style,  great heart.

I think this is book  that will last - one of those &quot;quiet&quot; books teacher, librarians  and critics will be recommending for years to come.<br />I loved the  &quot;secrets&quot; in the book, how they unfolded.  I loved the ending -  it was handled beautifully and with humor.  It held me right to the end,  but  perhaps there's another point to the readers' comments:  as a writer,  I read not just for the story, but for style and to learn how to write  better myself.  &quot;Charming Billy&quot;  gave me insight into my own  creative process, so maybe you could say that this is a writer's book - and  that the author is a writer's writer.

I have complained of this writing trait before:  the author continually  repeats the full names of the characters when you know perfectly well who  they are.  Tom Hart, Thomas Hart, Tommy Hart.  And the Germans - believe  me, dear author, I got their names the first, second and third times.  It  was quite tedious to have them fully repeated over and over.  I don't care  how many books an author has published, this is the kind of thing that is  blatantly amateurish.  Where are these &quot;bestselling authors'&quot;  editors?<br />Sentimental slop.  So very tired of the Noble White Man who  helps the Downtrodden Black Man.  Blagh.  Why did I read it? (didn't finish  it, but must take responsibility for slogging through three-quarters).

I have to confess that I have listened to these  books on tape as read by Barbara Rosenblatt for unabridged Recorded Books,  Inc.  Ms. Rosenblatt really does Scottoline's books justice, pardon the  pun.  They lend themselves to being read aloud because the  &quot;Philly-talk&quot; is so amusing.  Super entertaining!<br />Oh, another  thing I liked  was when Mary figured out that she idealized the law and its  symbols because she had lost faith in her religion.  Still, she is a very  good daughter, friend and she stands up for her clients against the odds,  so you really admire her.  Gutsy woman, and much more fun than grim old  Kate Scarpetta.

Once again, Mary McGarry Morris has given us a masterpiece of gut-wrenching, hilarious/tragic writing that is not to be put down until it comes roaring to a cymbal-crashing  halt.  Her photograph on the inside  back cover tells me that she has suffered like her quirky heroines -  her  eyes look sad.  <br />I could identify with this particular protagonist  more  than any of the people in her other books (though my favorite Morris work  is 'Vanished').  What I loved about this is Morris's total skewering of  &quot;peppy,&quot; &quot;upbeat,&quot; &quot;traditional&quot; families -  the whole &quot;family values&quot; hoo-ha.  She just layered dysfunction  upon dysfunction in this book and had me cracking up or crying all the way.  Poor Fiona.  Though both my parents were alive and known to me growing up,  I often felt like the &quot;poor relation&quot; or &quot;odd pet&quot; of  my family.  The &quot;secret&quot; was that my popular, lovey-dovey parents  were deeply insecure and financially unstable and took out their problems  on their children by abusing them and belittling them privately, while  putting on a &quot;happy face&quot; publicly. <br />I also loved the jaundiced  eye Fiona turned on her family's &quot;good deeds&quot; that brought them  such public acclaim but which were actually smokescreens to cover the  brutal dysfunction underlying their apparent saintliness.  I had that in my  family, too - the &quot;you can never give too much&quot; attitude that I  consider a hallmark of co-dependency. I wonder if it is also a New England  thing, since I was brought up not far from where Morris (or Fiona Range)  lives.<br />I have only one criticism, and I also voiced it after I read  &quot;Songs.&quot;  It is this: I felt the ending was too pat - I won't  give it away here.  But I am a writer myself and I felt that the endings of  &quot;A Dangerous Woman&quot; and &quot;Vanished&quot; were much more  satisfying - as a writer I felt they were perfectly &quot;true&quot; -  &quot;real&quot; - whatever.  But I do see where Morris was coming from.  I  guess I just wanted something a little, say, &quot;richer.&quot;  My  husband, upon hearing my complaint, said (channeling Steve Martin)  &quot;Well, EXCU-U-U-SE ME!&quot;, taking Morris's side.  He  heard me  chuckling and sighing all week as I ploughed happily through this book, and  feels I'm quibbling with a great piece of literature.  <br />In any case, my  heartfelt thanks to MMM, who is truly one of America's greatest living  storytellers.	2000-07-04

I really wanted to lose weight and though I didn't find it difficult to follow the Hellers' diet plan, I think I still wasn't in the right mind-set to use it effectively.  I believe that each person has different needs and must adapt any program to themselves specifically.  You have to know yourself and your body, and I have been in an eating disorders group for many years, so I am rather knowledgeable about what I can and cannot eat - in other words, what foods 'trigger' binge eating, etc.<br />However, the Hellers presented me with the opportunity to really get in touch with just how severely I was being effected by carbohydrates.  For several months I followed their plan, and still, for the most part, do, however what I mostly got from them was that to lose weight I had to basically give up bread, pasta, potato chips, white flour foods in general. This wasn't too hard for me, as I have not eaten white sugar for six years, in any form.  However, I now realize that lots of foods TURN INTO SUGAR and these were causing me to overeat and basically just turning into fat on my body.<br />The result is that I am now eating baked potatoes and brocoli without butter for my 'reward' meal, lots of salads, hard-boiled eggs, grilled chicken and fish for my low-carb meals.

What polygraph, whose polygraph?  As usual in this sordid tale in the death or their daughter JonBenet, the Ramseys set the terms, get their hired goons to carry out  their wishes, then report the biased and dummied up results. <br />Steve  Thomas' book is the best I have read on this murder so far.  He makes a  good case for the Ramsey's involvement in the murder of their daughter and  the complicity of the Boulder D.A.'s office in allowing the Ramseys to run  roughshod over justice and many innocent people's lives.  That the Ramseys  choose to cover up a crime they themselves did is criminal, but why accuse  everyone else and drag them through the mud? Accusing so many others of  murder is to me a mark of cold, calculating, and vicious monsters who think  nothing of hurting other people.  Because they did that, it is not a  stretch to believe they killed their daughter.	2000-05-28

This is a beautifully-told memoir of growing up in Kenya during the years of the &quot;White Mischief&quot; colony  of drunkards and libertines.  Juanita Carberry, by some amazing piece of good fortune, retained her  dignity and individuality, watching with a jaundiced eye as her nasty  father and promiscuous stepmother cavorted and stumbled around in the  jungle like displaced, pampered poodles, alterntately abusing and  abandoning her.<br />The true heroine here is Africa itself, its nurturing  native population (Ms. Carberry's spiritual friends and family) and its  natural beauty, from amusing and engaging wildlife to exotic flora and  breathtaking views. The great gems of the book are the numerous anecdotes  about her startling encounters with animals and insects (my favorite: her  predilection for termites - as opposed to locusts).<br />We don't get the real  gossipy &quot;scoop&quot; about the murder of the Earl of Errol until near  the end of the book (she was the ultimate 'witness.' The murderer actually  confessed to her.  However, she  was never called upon at trial because the  defense thought a child's testimony unreliable).<br />In the end, she defied  her inhumanly cruel parents and  governess by becoming a world-class  swimmer and Naval officer, and when her father implied that she wasn't even  his daughter she stood up for her &quot;true&quot; lineage: she was a  self-made woman, &quot;Me!&quot; she exclaims at the end, owned by no one  but herself.	2000-05-27
US	50734993	R37R06YL59GG1L	0385333706	648698209	After Long Silence: A Memoir	Books	5	7	9	N	N	Heroic in the greatest sense, and a literary masterpiece	To me, heroes are big, big people - people of great characterwho suffer, who stumble, sometimes fall, but pull themselves up and goon.  Often, they sacrifice everything in pursuit of life, love and truth.  Helen Fremont has many of these characteristics, and it is not a surprise, with such incredible parents.  Everyone in her family is lucky to be in that family.  <br />Why did reviewers nit-pick about Ms. Fremont's decision to come out as a lesbian to her parents, and in this book?  I felt she explained herself perfectly on this score: she had to risk something very personal herself in order to &quot;even the score&quot; of vulnerability with her parents.  Besides, I think it's fine that she came out in print.  Once again, not surprising - courage runs in her blood.<br />However, after putting the book aside for a few days, I must say that I understand her parents' fear and denial.  They probably feel that there are still enemies out there who want to harm them.  After all, Ms. Fremont alludes to a wave of anti-Semitism in Rome recently that resulted in damage to synagogues. The terror continues, readers, and could rear its ugly head at any time again. <br />I always think of anti-Semitism as a giant bear claw that sweeps across the sky, suddenly, a monstrous shadow over the people below.  It swoops, and there is blood and destruction of life and limb.<br />I was not born in Europe, and neither were my parents, but still there is a built-in fear.  All my life I have been prepared to run, if necessary. No wonder her mother and her aunt became so hysterical when confronted by exposure of the darkest time of their lives.  Still, it must be told.  This book is liberating for all Jews.	2000-05-23

I was bored plowing through a lot of details that didn't interest me as a reader but may have been important  to law enforcement officials.<br />However - compared to the horror of the  Ramsey case - the bungling, especially on the part of the D.A.'s office -  this book was a revelation.  Like Steve Thomas and his associates at the  Boulder police, the detectives in this case were dealing with a rich,  spoiled, arrogant suspect and because it was an &quot;inside&quot; job -  i.e., family member kills family members - it was hard to pin the suspect  down.  Like Thomas and the Boulder police, the Fresno cops worked like dogs  on the case for three years, getting worn down and losing their own  families in some cases.<br />Both of these books have increased my respect for  police work - especially detectives on long, difficult cases.  However, in  this case the D.A. was not afraid to go to court.  Eventually, common sense  won out and they knew they had to jump on what evidence they had.<br />One  other note: I am a psychic who works with the police on occasion in murder  and missing persons cases.  Often, the police will use psychics and then  throw them away scornfully, because they don't want to give credit to  someone outside their professional circle.  In the Steve Thomas book there  were the usual snide comments about psychics in general, but in &quot;Catch  Me If You Can&quot; the detectives do give the nod to the psychic who  &quot;saw&quot; that the murder weapon was buried.  Hey, thanks guys.  The  acknowledgement is appreciated.	2000-05-23

I am an avid reader and I can honestly say that this is the first book of my life that cries out to be nominated...awarded...a Nobel Peace Prize.  It is more than a memoir.  It is an epic tale of tragedy, mystery, heroism,  romance and identity for all people, of all backgrounds.  After all, this  discussion of &quot;roots&quot; is primal to every human being.<br />Although  I am not strictly a survivor of the Holocaust (though as a Jew and a member  of the Twentieth Century I believe I am) this book got me in touch with my  Jewish roots.  I believe that my parents were assimilated, and brought  their children up to eschew their religion, out of fear.  One day, while my  brother was studying for his Bar Mitzvah, he kissed the little velvet bag  that held his tallus (the Jewish prayer shawl).  Our mother was walking by  his room, came in, and struck him on the back, scolding, &quot;Don't ever  kiss an inanimate object.  It's disgusting.&quot;<br />I used to hold this  against my mother, who was in her twenties when victims of concentration  camps were emerging after the war.  Now I believe that she must have been  terrified to be Jewish herself, even though she never went through what  Helen Fremont's parents did.<br />I remember some lovely 'Jewish' moments from  my childhood - going to the Orthodox shul (synagogue) with my religious,  old-world grandparents; celebrating Purim, dressed as Ruth from the Bible;  finding the matzoh my grandfather had hidden on Passover, and receiving a  dollar for it; leaving the room to open the door for the angel Michael,  then returning to find the wine glass mysteriously drained (by the angel,  of course).  <br />As we grew up and especially after my grandparents died, we  were not encouraged to continue or be identified with these  rituals.<br />Reading Helen Fremont's book has brought them back for me, and  made me yearn to know more, to feel that warm, delicious feeling of  connection with an ancient past, so rich, so interesting.  Her parents  should be proud and grateful - she gave them back their past, and she made  the reader see them as unbelievably heroic people.  They will be forever  etched on my mind as magnificent examples of humanity.<br />Another thing this  book has done for me is to give me permission to be open about the book I  am writing about a tragic secret in my own family, and my search for  meaning.	2000-05-22

Now, when the book comes  out - I expect that our creative old junk dealer, Mr. Purvis, will have  been hit on by a floozy-hooker who wants to murder him for the money hidden  under the junk-pile sculpture.  I grew up in a &quot;junkyard&quot; (my  grandfather was a scrap metal dealer and we lived in a mansion overlooking  his &quot;empire&quot;) so the story had resonance for me.

I had never read anything (that I can remember) by Rumer Godden, and this book does not make that an imperative, unlike other biographies, which sent me racing to the book store to pick up the subject's works.  However, I do  want to see the Renoir adaptation of &quot;The River.&quot;<br />I found this  a bit boring.  Something about the slight, anecdotal writing.  It just  didn't pack a wallop for me.  I read to the end - it wasn't pure Hell  anything - but I didn't look forward to returning to it.<br />The rather wan  writing style may simply reflect the rather wan woman who was, according to  Chisholm's interpretation, stuffy and bound by a sort of suburban  conventionality.  And yet, one wonders what someone else might have made of  a life lived in such exotic places...<br />One example of the disappointing  writing of the book is the depiction of the relationship between Rumer and  the older sister she worshiped.  The biographer seems to have just gotten  her toes wet before she pulls back.  This sister was obviously jealous of  Rumer and hated to relinquish her queenly role in the family to the  daughter who waas obviously the better - at least more acclaimed - writer.   But the biographer seems to skirt this - she alludes to it, but never goes  deeply into it, as if, like her subject, she is wrinkling up her nose at  anything &quot;distasteful.&quot;	2000-05-17

This indicates the kind of parents they are: l) They are willing to  allow some people to go on thinking their little boy might have been the one to kill  his sister, a suspcion which will follow him all his life and 2) They are  forcing him to keep a bad secret, repress terrible thoughts and feelings,  and grow up believing that rich people can evade their legal  responsibilities. <br />If you really want the litmus test on the Ramseys,  check out the way they have treated people they once claimed as friends;  especially that poor old man across the street who obvioulsy adored  Jonbenet in a truly loving way, not because he could use her for anything.   He was Santa Claus, for Heaven's sake, and his poor old palsied hands shook  so hard they could just about pat her little head. Imagine claiming to the  police that that dear man actually snuck in and committed the atrocity most  of us know was an inside job. Their daughter is simply one of their many  victims.	2000-05-17

Steve's ghostwriter, Don Davis, deserves credit for making this a very, very readable, enjoyable book.  So many of these books are hard to swallow, not because they're wrong but simply because they are miserably, clunkily  written.  Don smoothes it all out and makes it a compelling ride.<br />My own  feeling is the kid did it. Poor little mixed-up, unhappy, emotionally  neglected, jealous, foolin-around-with-his -little-sister Burke.  The  strangulation tool was cub scout-sized, and when she started to scream he  bopped her with his baseball bat or a golf club.  After all, she was the  absolute center of that family's life.  Take a look at all the posed Ramsey  photos - poor little Burke is always relegated to the back row. I'm not  saying they didn't love him, but not like they LOOOVED Jonbenet.  Even the  voices on the 911 tape are evidence.  When John Ramsey says &quot;We're not  talking to you!&quot; to Burke's inquiry, &quot;What did you find?&quot; it  sounds like they were plenty mad at him.  And when the neighbor said she  heard &quot;a child&quot; scream - I don't think so.  I think it was Patsy,  discovering Jonbenet's body.<br />But you'll never know about Burke unless he  writes his book some day or unless it just pops out by accident.  He's the  minor child of wealthy parents and there's no way the cops can get by that  barrier, especially with top-notch attorneys barring the way. My feeling is  that the police are enraged because deep down they know it's Burke but they  have to be in denial because their hands are tied.  It's the Big Lie of  this whole pathetic thing.  Neither Patsy nor John killed their child.  Not  that Patsy's not capable of having brainwashed and manipulated her child,  and possibly threatening her to keep up the grotesque pageantry shtick.   She's a misguided woman, but I doubt that she killed her child, despite the  bedwetting theory. John's pretty much been cleared, and he's just too  absentee to be the main suspect.<br />The reason these two can stick together  and keep it all buttoned up is that they are trying to hold on to a last  shred of looking superior.  That's Patsy's thing, anyway.  Image is  everything.  If it was revealed that her little boy was engaged in sex  games with his sister (leaving &quot;semen&quot; that was oddly  &quot;semen-less&quot;), and inadvertently murdered her (and why would that  seem so odd these days - ten year olds are, indeed, killing each other left  and right) then she wouldn't be able to hold up her head at any country  club, church social or fashion show on earth.  I mean, Burke would forever  go down in history as the rich boy who murdered his beauty queen sister.  It's such a horrible blight on a family that I can see any family that  cares more about its image than anything else trying to cover it up.   What's sad is that it could have all been taken care of from the beginning  and Burke wouldn't have to hide his whole life from the truth.  I mean, now  he's being doubly overlooked - literally buried, along with his sister in  some respects.  Truly, the Ramseys are abusive parents on many levels,  though I'm sure they believed that they adored their children.<br />All that  aside, and certainly it has been put forth by others, this is a very good  true crime book.  I'm pretty sure Ann Rule would approve.	2000-05-14

I've heard such tales before, but I needed another shot of reality, if only to protect my  idols from ME!<br />At the risk of irritating the obviously sensitive author  (a mini-Miss-Lily?) my take on her experience is that she couldn't get mad  at her wise and loving mother for being an alcoholic and polio victim who  Rosemary felt she had to protect and constantly save from disaster.  She  was needed as a caretaker and her mother was so obviously debilitated and  yet trying so hard to do a good, if exhausting job herself.  Also, Rosemary  had been abandoned by her father and had obviously been lied to about that  by her mother.  So how could she rebel against such a saintly, sad,  charming, hard-working woman, the only true source of love in her  life?<br />O.K.  Along comes Lillian Hellman - the perfect Mommie from Hell  for a seventeen-year-old in need of someone or something to hate, hate,  hate.  They were made for each other.  I loved them both in this vivid,  hilarious, heartbreaking and compulsively readable story.

It  makes a &quot;great&quot; man quite human, although it is amusing to note  that Kerouac's &quot;On The Road&quot; is a far-superior book - a truly  great work.

I approached this Celebrity Memoir cautiously, for I had just finished Aretha Franklin's &quot;From These Roots&quot; which was about as dishonest as a memoir can get.  I was amazed to find this one to be the complete  opposite - and yet, just like Aretha's, also not terribly deep.  I adore  Claire Bloom the actress, the same as I do Aretha the singer.  But as  writers they leave a lot to be desired.  Nevertheless, I gave this book  four stars for the sad but honest look she was willing to give us of her  disastrous relationships.  Still - can any creative, intellectual woman out  there honestly say that if Richard Burton, Laurence Olivier and Phillip  Roth had desired them they would not have gone, willingly, to their doom?   Not me! you protest.  Well, not me, either, but that's easy for us to say.   Who hasn't had a wounded relationship with her father?  Especially us  driven, creative types.  I just want to hug Claire Bloom - she's such a  charming person.  And I'd like to slug Phillip Roth except that he's given  me a few fabulous moments in literature and theater (&quot;The Ghost  Writer&quot; is my favorite work of his) that make me fond of him despite  his being a mysoginist.

The photographs in the book are fascinating, especially those of the late Natalie Wood, at her most fetching.  It makes you sad, because she looked so vital, making it hard to think of her tragic death.<br />The text tells rather nasty or 'so-what?' stories I think everybody who's interested in  celebrities already pretty much knows.  The really interesting writing  comes at the end, when the author sinks so low he has to move to (gulp)  Oregon, effectively becoming &quot;trailer trash,&quot; and sells his  treasured celebrity coasters, among other glittering tsatskes. <br />Praise be  to the Higher Power, Mr. Dunne clawed his way back to the middle (he's no  Joan Didion, let's face it) and has become one of our most illustrious  high-class-tabloid heroes.  <br />He's gone through some horrendous tragedies,  and I toast his chutzpah and commitment to writing. He's amazingly  resiliant, if only for the horrible experiences he went through with the   cruel and  crude Frank Sinatra.  I'm glad ol' blue eyes stuck around long  enough to see Dominick Dunne still standing, better than he ever did.<br />Of  all the pictures in the book there is one I keep going back to.  It's on  page 33, and it makes me cry.	2000-03-05

Not enough &quot;down and dirty&quot; information we all crave about what it means to be a woman in show-biz, how she did it, who she did it with, etc.  It's  bland and barely scratches the surface of an obviously fabulous fantasy  life.  <br />She doesn't come across as a particularly interesting person, yet  you know she must be.   I found her food references a tad embarrassing, for  the obvious health reasons - (hey, I'm a woman, I have my food obsessions,  too, but when you reach a certain age you sort of start pulling in the  reins, just so you can live a little longer, and we do want Aretha around  for many more years).   I made her rosemary chicken wings for years until I  realized I needed to put down the fork and the fat if I wanted to arrest  the &quot;spread.&quot;<br />Still - &quot;Pink Cadillac&quot; gets me through  the day like no other high.  She's  my choice for Top Angel-Voice.  Thanks,  Aretha.  One tip: get a better ghost writer for Volume II.  David Ritz must  have been a cousin or someone else you &quot;owe.&quot;  No, no, no.<br />P.S.   Does anyone know where I can get an Aretha Franklin bumper sticker(s)?   Maybe a fan club member could e-mail me.	2000-03-03

It is like a perfectly beautiful colored drawing, sometimes black and white, in brush and inks, just like  the works of art Lindsey writes about with obvious knowledge of his  subject.<br />You just saw everything so vividly. I particularly appreciated  the mouthwatering European travelog, the descriptions of scenes,  restaurants, food, hotels - visited by the rich and famous.  <br />There is a  flaw in this book that keeps it from being a great, however. (Sorry if it  bothers some amazon review readers, but I often give five stars to a book  for having entertained me thoroughly, and this one did).  It is this:   every truly great book is laced with wit.  Read the grimmest novels, say,  by Dostoevsky, Dickens or Tolstoy, and  even and even some of the best  contemporary detective and mystery writers  and you will be chuckling,  laughing, amused.  &quot;The Color Of Night&quot; would have benefited had  Lindsey given us a few wry touches here and there.  He was too dead  serious, which sometimes lent it a slightly precious tone. Of course,  &quot;precious&quot; can be hilarious, and he might have capitalized on  some of his foppish characters, but I found this novel too  stolid.<br />Another flaw: like some of the beautiful drawings one sees, the  perfect, deft creations of the greatest artists, there is a coldness about  the book itself.  If I didn't know otherwise, I would have guessed that the  author wrote the whole book with a quill pen and ink.  I can see him  thinking, dipping, scribing, again and again, with a dispassionate hand -  and heart.  Not exactly an insult, but sometimes I like a feeling (and the  word 'feeling' is exactly the word I meant to use) that the work is coming  from the artist's gut.  Like Van Gogh, for example, who wasn't afraid to  make a mess.<br />Nevertheless, despite these flaws, &quot;The Color Of  Night&quot; is a fun book to read and Hollywood would be crazy not to make  it into a movie.  Clint Eastwood as Harry?  This time, clean, of course.   Harry Strand is a morally upright man, despite his years of spying and his  (acceptable) thievery.  I'm glad he lived to &quot;watch&quot; Mara cross  the street.	2000-02-27

Though I am a Jewish woman, born in America, I, too, have grappled with my identity.  Ms. Asayesh stirred feelings in me about my own assimilation from my childhood, when I lived  with my orthodox Jewish grandparents and celebrated holidays and customs  that, as time went on and the elders died or I moved away from them, lost  their hold on me. <br />The author's descriptions of her loving family and the  warmth and sweetness of past rituals and the land she had loved as a child  were very touching.  I was especially moved when she wrote that her aunt,  visiting in Canada, had wept, noting  that North America is so green, and  Iran is so brown...and dry.  It made me realize, not without a little  shame, that I take my homeland for granted, and also that there are people  who, though they may be less fortunate, love their parched homeland as much  as I love my fertile one.  <br />Although it was hard to hear about the  dogmatic, sexist,  religious practices and the anti-Americanism of many  Iranians today, it is important to remember that America is not without its  flaws in these and other areas. We, too, have an extreme, right-wing  element that opposes women's rights and the rights of minorities. We have  plundered others' lands in the name of Democracy when, in fact, it is  economic interest that motivates us.  We still have the death penalty here.   Hate crimes abound.  Children murder other children.  Addiction to drugs  and alcohol is rampant.  Our politicians are corrupt, and we accept this  with cynicism.  <br />And yet I, too, love my homeland and forgive its many  sins.  At least I can still live here fairly comfortably.  Ms. Asayesh  found herself in exile from the place she loved.  The wrenching sadness of  that disconnection was beautifully portrayed.  I hope a lot of people read  this book.	2000-02-21

I read this book many years ago, in college, and remember enjoying it thoroughy.  I have recently heard it read (Recorded Books, Inc.) by the incomparable George Guidall, who seems to read books requiring Yiddish  phrases/accents particularly well (try Stanley Elkin's &quot;Mrs. Ted  Bliss&quot; for a hilarious and compassionate thrill).<br />I was not  disappointed this second time around, having matured myself, both as a  reader and a writer.  One of the most striking aspects of the novel is  Roth's obvious love of women; few novels by men present women in such a  truly beloved light.  David's aunt - something of a shrew, a harridan, and  a slob - is nevertheless incredibly  good-hearted - and alive!   Now I want  to know more about Henry Roth.  Does anyone know if there is a biography of  this great writer available?  Also, I noticed that there is a book of  essays about &quot;Call It Sleep.&quot;  I plan to get it.	2000-02-21

A fabulous addition to Ms. Rule's growing collection of true crime books.  I couldn't put it down...now my husband's reading it and I probably won't see him with his nose out of the book for days.   Oh, well. <br />I must say  Ms. Rule is a courageous woman.  She writes with complete honesty about the  most hideous people - not just the murderers but their family and cronies -  you have to give her credit for daring to tread...<br />This story too tragic  to have been fiction.  Poor Ann Marie.  I really fell in love with her. We  all know women like her - smart, sweet, vulnerable, beautiful but doesn't  know it.   I did feel sympathy for Debby MacIntyre.  If you've read Women  Who Run With the Wolves,  you know that we still get into these 'Bluebeard'  relationships and once you're in it's so hard to extricate yourself.  As a  friend of mine used to say, &quot;A woman can love a pig.  After all,  they're so cute.&quot;  Yes, women are trained to love, to be supportive,  to stand by their man, blah-blah-blah.  Which is why I of admired Kay  Capano  in this book, for insisting on keeping her indendence and identity  as a nurse-practitioner, for extricating herself from the clutches of a  true monster, for actually saying that she wasn't testifying on her ex's  behalf, not 'standing by my man' - but strictly for her daughters. Most of  all, for refusing to be in denial about her &quot;vile&quot; (her word!)  ex-husband.<br />Ann Rule's objective portrayal of Ann Marie's eating disorder  was one of the best I have ever read anywhere.  I have been in an eating  disorders recovery group for years but have read no better depiction of  what it's really like to go through it.  It was consciousnesss-raising -  especially the loss of control by one who so desperately feels she needs to  be in control.  I hated Capano for playing on that in Ann Marie.  It was  his meanest attempt to manipulate her.<br />As for the Capanos - it was hard  to tell why four such privileged men wereso incredibly woman-hating.  But  there were a few clues if you read between the lines.  For one thing, Louis  Capano, Sr. - the father of the whole bunch - basically disowned his  daughter, Marian simply because she was a female.  Mrs. Capano, Sr. never  worked outside the home - she was a sheltered person who didn't even  &quot;understand how the law works - why my son is considered guilty&quot;  when it was all over.  Hello!  I mean, this woman was either eleven ravioli  to the dozen or deliberately kept in the dark by what I'd be willing to bet  was a control-frreak husband.  After all, Mrs. Capano lived in America most  of her life.  Without a clue as to its legal foundation? Did she never read  a book or newspaper?  Once again - she was probably considered as much  &quot;chattel&quot; as her sons' wives and mistresses, sort of a beloved  (maybe not even that, but you would never know, of course) 'pet' or 'house  slave,' given all the luxuries and wifely status and weak enough to accept  them in exchange for playing dumb.  I think the Capano men simply felt they  had the right to &quot;own&quot; women, that women were there purely for  their needs, desires, vanities, not to be taken seriously as human  beings.<br />In fact, I have never read of any family of who had such contempt  for women, including the mother, who blamed everything on Debby.   <br />Actually, Gerry was the ony one I liked.  I felt sorry for him, but I  think he had a good heart.  Go know.	2000-02-12

(I have never been able to get past the first chapter of any of this others.) This seems to be his  truly radical book - the one he wrote with  real passion because someone he knew died of cancer and his hatred burned  so bright for the tobacco companies that he actually wrote a flowing,  textured work.<br />My own mother died of lung cancer  at the untimely age of  forty-eight (she started smoking at thirteen).  This book took me back to  that terrible experience. Indeed, if this book had come out twenty years  ago, when she died, I might have sued the tobacco company whose cigarettes  she smoked.   I was  in my mid-twenties and I have never never gotten over  her painful and unneccessary death.<br />Is this book too radical for the  movies?  I haven't heard that it was going to be produced.

I enjoyed reading this for fun - I mean, it's definitely a &quot;chick&quot;  book - a juicy-gossipy-type soap opera, and they have their place - but  profound?  Important literature? Come on!<br />A far better version of the  same kind of story is the book (not the movie!) &quot;Random Hearts.&quot;  In fact, this feels like a second-rate rip-off of Warren Adler's little  jewel, which has better character development and  more believable  surprises.  The main characters are also more sympathetic.  Read it if you  want the thrill without the corn-ball, shallow delivery.<br />As for the  reviewer here who likened the &quot;vivid imagery&quot; of   'The Pilot's  Wife&quot; to that of &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; - I am shocked.  Did we  read the same books? &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; is a masterpiece compared to  this piece of drivel.  Anita Shreve may be a great writer of other books.

I thought, what kind of parents would allow  their child to go out into the world alone like that? <br />I also felt sad  when he realized, fully, that his parents didn't &quot;see&quot; him  anymore, that he was something of a ghost in his home, being  &quot;allowed&quot; to nest there.<br />I had to laugh when his father said he  could get a job at a casino if &quot;the professor thing&quot; didn't work  out, and the man's non-sequitor conversations with his son.  It reminded me  of my father.  When I was in my mid-thirties I told him I felt suicidal  over a recent romantic loss.  &quot;Gee, the price of real estate is going  up around here!&quot; he exclaimed.<br />I, too, am writing a memoir, so Mr.  Doty's unusually poignant and open-hearted one was very helpful.  He's a  wonderful storyteller.<br />Thanks to the author.  e-mail:  femmesage@earthlink.net if he's ever going to be in Santa Fe.	2000-01-21

The review by so-called Librarina which appeared just after mine,  makes me sad that some feel the need to tear down writers who are trying to communicate their deepest feelings.  <br />I didn't find Ms. Bullitt-Jonas's  story self-absorbed.  However, a memoir about recovery will be a lot about  the person who is writing it.  Why would one expect any less from such a  book?  I, for one, was fascinated by this woman's inner journey, because I  identified with so much of it.<br />Librarina must have had some big buttons  pushed when reading this.  It sounds like she - or he? - (too cowardly to  let us know, unlike Margaret, who revealed herself with admirable candor)  may be a struggling addicted person.  Indeed, the reference in the slightly  off-key referral to AA shows that this person is on the fringes of  recovery.  May I recommend that Librarina take a look at the reason she (or  he) felt compelled to read the book all the way through and admit that she  (or he) needs the kind of help Margaret got, help that resulted in a deeply  moving literary achievement?	2000-01-15

An earth goddess, yes, but nevertheless a goddess of literature and wisdom, symbolic for women the world over as One Who Has Made It, One Who Has Expressed It, One Who Teaches, etc.  She is  among my favorite writers.  I don't love each work equally, but she's an  artist, so she's entitled to irritate or bore on occasion.  I notice from  previous reviews that, like all artists, she touches some and leaves others  cold.  What I got from Paradise is her ongoing teaching that not all  African American people were raised in the south; not all were directly  effected by slavery; in other words, there are myriad Black stories just as  there are myriad White stories. This one was particularly odd.  I just got  the unabridged audio version to find out what I missed in a first reading,  and I'm sure there will be much.  To dissatisfied reviewers: some  literature is not a quick read.  It takes a bit of thought, study, review,  and if it's a nonlinear book you might have to re-read it in a nonlinear  way, even keeping a journal of what baffles you until the pieces of the  puzzle fit.  In that way, Ms. Morrison is not unlike Faulkner,  whose great  book The Sound And the Fury has bedeviled readers for years.  I feel this  novel is a box of (Pandora's) secrets, or a puzzle. Thanks again to the  goddess and the Goddess for another fascinating collaboration.<br />e-mail me  if you're a Toni Morrison fan and want to share: femmesage@earthlink.net	2000-01-13

Every time I had to put it down I couldn't wait to get back to it.  I kept thinking, This is an elegant idea - books within a book.  I learned  so much.  The main character, Janeway, is a believable, loveable  cop-turned-enterepeneur.  Rarely have I read of any cop who so thoroughly  undergoes a &quot;satori&quot; mid-book.  <br />I bought The Bookman's Wake,  thumbed through it quickly to see if any of the characters were continued  and was disappointed that they didn't. Not a mention of the quirky Rita  McKinley, or Ruby, etc.  Still, I plan to read it because I'm hoping Mr.  Dunning didn't lose his knack for telling a juicy story and teaching me  more about writers, writing, books.	2000-01-07

I'm giving this four instead of five stars because it's absolutely a blast of a juicy, gossipy &quot;women's&quot; book, which most of us women love; as for the actual writing - it's not Toni Morrison, okay?  Indeed, as one  reviewer below has written, it's a little disconcerting when Americans  don't speak like Americans.  We don't  use expressions like &quot;the lot  of them&quot; and &quot;I'm off to the store,&quot; etc.  - things like  that.  You have to wonder - don't these famous writers get edited?<br />Still  - this is a much more fun potboiler/soap opera than (ick) Danielle Steele,  as another reviewer recommended.  Danielle Steele's adjectives are,  typically:  &quot;fabulous&quot; - &quot;fantastic&quot; -  &quot;incredible&quot; - &quot;marvelous.&quot; As they say, never  underestimate the reading taste of the American public!  As far as I'm  concerned, Pilcher is right up (or down) there with Danielle Steele.  But  Maeve Binchy was recommended to me years ago by a highly erudite librarian  who read everything from Shakespeare to Joyce.  Thus, when Tara Road came  my way in the form of an unabridged audio tape read by Jenny Sterlin, I  figured I'd take a chance, and man - couldn't get enough of it.  It's easy  listening, but as smooth as Irish coffee laced with Hagendaas ice cream.	1999-12-21

This book was very real in its portrayal of the way women need men in their lives and will allow even extremely dysfunctional men to share their lives out of simple fear of loneliness and sexual needs.  As a feminist, I  too deplore the way her lover treated Zorah, who should have known better.   But shouldn't we all?  They used to say that lesbians were on the front  lines of the women's movement, but I've always felt straight women were,  because they  have to share their hearts and beds with the enemy.  <br />It's  not easy being a woman in a man's world, and sometimes we have to take what  we can get if we want the social status that comes with having a man.   Also, by the time Zorah realized how destructive Frank could be, she was  already in love with him.  It's very difficult for a woman to UN-love a  man, because women are trained to love unconditionally.  Actually, it's a  beautiful trait that often gets us in trouble.  I happen to think it's  great to simply live alone or be without a man - many women can do that.   But sometimes a jerk just slips in.  McMillan realistically portrays this  moment in a woman's life.  Also - Frank redeemed himself by apologizing for  everything and getting into career and substance abuse recovery in the end.   He wasn't a complete scoundrel; just a sef-centered a---h---.  Any of you  girlfriends out there recognize him?	1999-12-15

I love amazon.com because we get to comment on old books as well as new.  Thank you, management, for being there.<br />As one person has said here, I, too, felt terribly sorry for Seryozha, Anna's little son.  In fact, I have  always thought someone should write a sequel to the book, (if they had the  nerve), about the child's future life.<br />I detested Anna's husband; when  I read the book again years later I did not despise Vronsky - he's just  weak and frankly, it was a no-win situation.  In any case, I have often, as  a woman, referenced back to Anna's situation, both from my own as well as  friends' experiences.  Despite the author's maddening relationship with his  wife and other women, he really &quot;got it&quot; when it came to Anna.  All in all, a divine creation that can never be surpassed.	1999-12-15

It has a true  nightmare quality.  As a writer it hs stayed with me as far as the ideas  go.  And when business is bad I always say I'm going through a &quot;Dead  Zone.&quot;  And when I say that, I am definitely referring to this book,  because I'm a professional psychic whose clients, though they often ask for  revelation, don't really want to hear it when it comes!

Perhaps they have read very few spiritual fables. I loved the opening part about the nurse's return home and her bad man (the surgeon) but after that it got  really ho-hum.  I mean, been there, done that!  The lesson: love yourself  first and foremost was a good one, but after one page, it was transmitted,  transmuted and transferred.  This is one of those fluffy, airy books that  could have gone much deeper, but didn't.  Those who wish to find true  inspiration in a small book should try The Four Agreements by Miguel Ruiz.  Now there's a great one!	1999-12-15

Hey, you win a lot, lose a few...but others seemed to have loved it, so more power to you.  I was thrilled by the beginning, irritated by the end.  Nevertheless, it was a creative attempt, and I always admire that in any  artist.  I just wish King had stayed with reality instead of suddenly  jumping into fantasy.  Nothing wrong with fantasy, but it just didn't  &quot;go&quot; here, at least for me.  I finished it, but it was a grueling  experience.  I kept hoping it would get good again.  Also - the ending was  a feminist tract.  And I am a dyed-in-the-wool feminist.  I just don't love  blatant politics with my fiction.  Now, for a subtle feminist  novel, one  that really packs a punch in that area, read Deloris Claiborne - it's a  masterpiece of courageous womanhood against the odds.	1999-12-15

I thought Kathy Bates was superb in  the movie role, and I was surprised at how much I loved the film, because  the book is deep and richly detailed, yet the movie captured the mood.

I have always been one of those kids who was  kind of annoyed by clowns and have never really found them funny or even  very interesting, except as symbols of tragedy and pain, like Pagliachi.   King has outdone himself with this novel.  And they made a great miniseries  from it!

It doesn't have the depth of Deloris Claiborne,  the bone-freezing splendor of The Shining, the (amazingly) non-sentimental bathos of The Green Mile, the scope of The  Stand or the touching vulnerability of The Body.  However, it's one of his  absolutely FUNNEST (word? you know what I mean) books. <br />I felt like a  little kid, eating a candy bar that left the book sticky with chocolate  fingerprints as I flipped the pages compulsively.

Any novelist who can make  us believe so completely in evil embodied is a brilliant writer.  He also  does it in Salem's Lot,The Shining and It, but the Walkin' Dude is  definitely his outstanding villain.  You know what's really fun about  Stephen King?  He never ends.

I think the  &quot;Reader From Europe&quot; (below) has summed it up pretty well,  however.  I know I felt great compassion for &quot;The Good Soldier&quot;  of whom the narrator speaks.  To me the novel was aboutl his sexual  suppression.

Frankly, this grown up  was nearly sickened by it, as I am by most good vampire tales. I read them,  but I always feel a little nauseous by the end.  This one was no exception.  This book seemed something of a metaphor for alcoholism - or any addiction  - and its attendant symptoms of isolation/paranoia. And I have to admit I  didn't quite get the ending.

This is the best ever - I love this author's work but this is definitely his highest accomplishment.  In this novel you can see his influence on Dickens.  Stavrogin is a villain to end all villains.  Yes, this is about  revolution, but it is also about unrequited love (and how people will go to  the ends of the earth making fools of themselves over it).

I have written a review twice on this book and I'm certain other women have written about it, too, because it's quite &quot;hot&quot; among people with  eating disorders (legions of us!).  But for some reason reviews have not  been entered since last January.  How come?<br />My take, as I've written  before, is that it's a poignant and wonderfully-written book but I can't  understand how the author could name the recovery program she's in so  blatantly since it's specifically drummed into our heads that we are always  to remain &quot;anonymous&quot; in any twelve-step program, and that no one  should publicize their participation in the program in order to make money  from it.

Song of Solomon fascinated me from the first page, but unfortunately my interest dropped off as it progressed. Loved the characterizations, and I am a fan of this author.  In some ways, she can do no wrong because her  worst book is not even most writers' best.  <br />My favorites of hers are The  Bluest Eye and Beloved.  The suspense and depth of both of these books were  sustained right to the finish.  They were, frankly, epic novels, and each  of Morrison's books is very, very different from the others...talk about a  great writer!<br />However,Song of Solomon, I felt, deteriorated because it  became too DIDACTIC.  I like my fictional politics acted out; this book  began to feel preachy.  As a Jewish woman, I can understand why African  American readers could be thrilled by this.  We (African Americans, Jews,  women) need outspoken champions of our struggles, and as a woman and a  Jewish person I am always cheered at courageously radical protest that  encompasses my personal/political concerns.  However, GREAT (read: lasting)  fiction generally does not do this.  It subverts through action and  seduction.  If it's too blatant, it becomes more of a political tract than  a novel, and often doesn't pass the test of time.  (It's as if Morrison  stopped writing the novel's story for a section of it in order to insert  specific political ideas she wanted to make sure she got  across.)<br />However, if you had to choose between Danielle Steele or any  Tony Morrison book, I would exhort you to choose the latter.  You will  learn about life, love, racism, and, finally, good writing.	1999-12-12

US	50734993	R11P2PTXJNGVDF	0440223849	195697104	A Legacy of Vengeance (Sheriff Bramlett Mystery)	Books	3	1	4	N	N	Good plotting but amateurish writing style	This writer has potential.  The story line is interesting, and I wanted to read to the end.  The characters were fairly amusing, too.  It's kind of a Heat of the Night scenario, with the sherriff and his deputies not unlike  the TV show.<br />However, I feel this book could not have received the  attention it merited from its editors.  There are some extremely irritating  style quirks that made me want to stop reading entirely, but I pushed on  because I did want to see &quot;who dunnit.(By the way, the ending is  anticlimactic, another problem.  Frankly, I barely cared who dunnit.  It  was a side character that just wasn't quite involved or interesting enough,  and sort of came on the scene suddenly.) <br />Back to the style problems, and  I'll just write about the two most glaring ones.  <br />First, it is not  necessary in fiction to keep repeating the full name, first and last, of a  main character.  It really gets in the way of this writer's work. The  sherriff's full name is continually repeated, as are both of his deputies.  There is a deputy named H.C. Curry, for example. For some reason, the  author was in love with that name, because he used it, over and over and  over again, ad naseum.  Unnecessary!  We got who he was talking about,  again and again. <br />Also: I got really bored by the descriptions of so many  shocked peoples' eyes widening, getting wider, being wide open, flying wide  open, etc., etc., etc.  These stylistic techniques mark the amateur writer.   Once again - he has potential, but somebody (hopefully his editor) should  give him a tune-up because it's kind of silly, really, especially when the  book is about serious material (racial tension, etc.)  <br />Oh, and one more  thing: I found it rather unbelievable that a young, educated African  American southern male would not know about the history of the Civil Rights  Movement, especially in the south.  It just didn't cut it that H.C. (notice  that you don't need to repeat the whole name to get the picture) needed a  three-hour lecture from his father about how bad things were.  Only one  thing might have redeemed this point: if we were let in on some of the  well-researched history, and really learned something new ourselves.	1999-12-06

When I was younger, I worshiped his writing, and  Buddenbrooks was one of my favorite novels of all time (still  is).<br />Despite my recent and more mature awareness of his weaknesses, he  remains a surprising, brilliant writer.  His prose style is dynamic and I  continue to emulate that.  I was amused to find, however, that I liked the  lesser known stories.  I found &quot;Death In Venice&quot; ponderous.  I  liked the stories about the incestuous twins, the tragic man who was  dwarfed from a childhood fall, the cuckolded buffoon who is talked into  wearing a tutu at a community recital and the eccentric who is compelled to  continually mutiliate his dog and heal him.  Now these are what I would  call real &quot;case histories.&quot;  I'm sure Mann would scorn me for  being partial to these, scornfulness being one of his main attitudes in  life. His very disdain of pretension, however, seems like a pretension in  itself.  Still - his command of language is like no other's.	1999-12-02

The wonderful Frank Mueller, &quot;super star of audio&quot; does the honors on those little serialized tapes.  It was like sitting on your Daddy's lap   listening to him read you the most wonderful story in the world.<br />King's  incredible/impossible feat: the mouse. You BELIEVE in it!  <br />All I can say  is, the movie better be good or there are going to be some very  disappointed readers out there!	1999-11-30
US	50734993	R38HJ8F5VJFEWM	0440181488	279794668	Son	Books	5	16	17	N	N	My favorite true crime book, with Small Sacrifices	I devoured this book.  It is as tight and intriguing as Ann Rule's Small Sacrifices.  The thing that's so amazing is that he kept getting away with his crimes, again and again, and nobody caught on.  Also, the descriptions  of his loathesome mother and father and his own arrogance are perfectly  depicted by the author.  The fun thing about the great true crime books is  their irony: we, the reader, know &quot;who done it&quot; but the police  don't, at least until some crafty detective puts the pieces of the puzzle  together or the criminal goofs up so badly the answer is literally  screaming his/her name.  <br />I'm surprised there are so few reviews for this  book.  In any case, it's a true crime masterpiece.	1999-11-30
US	50734993	R3OBPYO93PH6DD	0671744631	824428233	Small Sacrifices	Books	5	6	9	N	N	The best ever	I read this book years ago, and went hunting for it here at amazon to see if others loved it as much as I did, and was not surprised to see that they did.  As far as I am concerned, this is absolutely Rule's finest.   <br />Farrah Fawcett did justice to the role on TV, but I can't help wondering  if the sociopathic Ms. Downes wasn't flattered by such a gorgeous sexual  icon and brilliant actress playing her.  I say this because when I saw her  interviewed on Oprah I couldn't help but think that she was the epitome of  what I think of as an egotist run-amok.  <br />Usually, murderers have a very  low self-esteem, but she actualy seemed quite pleased with herself.  An  amazing woman - completely, it seems, without conscience.  In any case, the  story as Rule tells it is tightly woven and leads you on like a snake  charmer.  If you haven't read this one, and you like &quot;true  crime,&quot; you won't be disappointed.	1999-11-30

There's only one problem with these books (and I have to admit, I'm a fan of the genre): you begin to think your husband, boyfriend, brother, cousin, next door  neighbor, and the nice little old lady at the hospital who dispenses  pleasantries just might be a cold-blooded killer.  I'm always a little  stand-offish toward my strange-acting neighbor when reading these things.   I try to think if there have been any killings or rapes in our neighborhood  lately, and when his car doesn't show up for a week or two, I brood a bit  on what he's been up to.  However, soon after putting the book down, I  realize that my imagination has been racing out of control thanks to Ann  Rule, and how silly it was to suspect him of Ted Bundy-like behavior.  <br />I  hope she comes out with a new one soon.  In fact, in case true crime fans  haven't noticed, there hasn't been too much fresh product in this area  lately.  Gee, doesn't anyone want to go on a killing spree, so we can get  our kicks?	1999-11-30
