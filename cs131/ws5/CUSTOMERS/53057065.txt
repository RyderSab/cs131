US	53057065	R1596Z2JPXZ332	0716723271	345550391	Spacetime Physics	Books	4	9	10	N	N	Wonderful book	I found this book was terrific for getting an intuitive understanding of Special Relativity. While I could do the math before, when I read this book I felt I really understood it. For example the various paradoxes no longer worry me e.g. the travelers paradox. <br /> <br />For fast learning of SR there is nothing better in my opinion. It is longish but easy reading and they cover the common \\"worries\\" the reader may have in little out-takes so you can cruise along at a rapid pace.  <br /> <br />My only criticism is the peculiar use of language. They invent various terms such as \\"free-float frame\\" instead of inertial frame which may cause people grief in further studies. They also rather ostentatiously use \\"non-sexist\\" language, always calling the physicist \\"she\\" (if only!) and so forth. This is distracting. They adopt the IAU recommendation to omit \\"the\\" in front of Earth, Sun and Moon, which is also distracting. For some reason in some chapters they drop \\"the\\" numerous times for no obvious reason - it looks like some of the text was written by someone who is not a native speaker of English though there is no mention of a co-author anywhere. <br /> <br />There minor points aside, this is a wonderful book.	2005-07-17

You will need some math knowledge to really appreciate this book - familiarity with algebra, complex numbers, and maybe some basic calculus.  <br /> <br />A real pleasure to read.	2005-06-12

His explanation of what is wrong about quantum measurement theory is superb. He goes beyond the evidence but that's OK because he lets you know what is real and what is speculative. You would need to know a bit pf physics to follow all this I suspect. <br /> <br />The second \\"book\\", embarrassing though mercifully short is an attempt to refute the notion that machines will be able to think, and also an attempt to suggest that the solution of the problem of consciousness is somehow related to the unification of gravity and quantum machanics. Here Penrose shows himself to be a philosphical amateur - his material on the theory of the mind would get him an \\"F\\" in Philosophy 101 I am afraid. The bibliography backs up this view - there are few books of philosophy mentioned. It looks like he has not done his homework. The only good bit here is the material about Turing machines which has excellent coverage of the limitation of machines which embody this model of what \\"computation\\" is. <br /> <br />Overall I loved this book for its physics but don't read it expecting to learn anything much about AI or consciousness.	2005-03-25

A silver haired gentleman staring resolutely into the future. My next door neighbour on the train commented \\"he looks like a pompous ....head\\".  <br /> <br />This was at it turned out.

Repeats - obviously without checking - the feminist lie that there was a &quot;Rule of Thumb&quot; which permitted men to beat their wives with a stick no thicker than their thumb.

There is a lot of quite dry material and in places it is repetitive.<br />It provides terrific insight into the problem of imitating human thinking at a deep level, and I found it very rewarding. It was also very interesting to follow the threads of how he went about doing research, and what he thought of other AI research.<br />His views of various flavours of AI research were very instructive and inightful I thought.<br />In summary a good book, but this is not (high quality) brain candy like Godel Escher Bach etc.	2004-04-18

This is a state of mind where we think of ourselves and not of others. By objectifying others and by filtering our perceptions to protect our self image, we get locked into couterproductive interactions with other people.<br />It reminded me of two other similar books &quot;Who moved my cheese&quot; and &quot;Seven Habits of Highly Effective People&quot;. All three books feel life changing and inspiring, but they fail to change lives. The common element is the simplistic notion that one simple thing (or 7 things) is the magic bullet that is going to change everything. <br />The 'religious' flavour is consistent with the reviews that say &quot;this stuff is all in the bible&quot;. <br />There is no practical advice about how to deal with abusive and exploitative people, how to balance your own needs with the needs of others etc.<br />I don't dispute the need for everyone to be self aware and aware of their effect on others, to question their assumptions about themselves and to look at themselves as part of a social system. But there are plenty of better books about that. For example &quot;The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work&quot; by John Gottman - which has much wider applicability than just marriage.<br />The Arbinger group runs courses and seminars to fill in the blanks. However given the cost of the book it should have more practical detail to deminstrate that this is not just a bunch of nice sounding words.	2004-01-09

It can help in understanding manhood and what it means.<br />There is so much bad press about men that a positive book that helps focus on building on men's strengths and on the contribution they can make is very welcome. <br />The book has a lot of material about living a fulfilling and authentic life as a man. <br />The material on common problem areas is also very useful - relationships with fathers, developing a positive relationship to your sexuality, common misconceptions about men. <br />This book was also published in some countries as \\"Manhood\\".<br />Highly recommended.	2003-12-30

It is mostly very wise, sound, practical advice about raising children. My two caveats are:<br />1. It is hard to tell what is just Steve's opinion and what is based on solid research. So it is hard to know how much reliance to place on the material in the book. <br />2. I think he makes a big mistake in his recommended form of praise. He recommends what others call 'generic' or 'judgemental' praise. This is praise such as \\"You are smart\\" or \\"You are hard working\\". The trouble with this is that it is a judgement and it is not specific. It puts the parent in the position of judging the child's worth. If the parent is later critical, the child is likely to take it very hard. In some cases generic praise can be very demeaning and demoralising. I know of one case where a person reacted with fury to a comment \\"You are a good mother\\" because of this judgemental aspect.<br />In my view it is much better to say \\"That is an insighful point you made in the essay\\" or \\"You worked hard on that\\" or \\"your child looks very happy\\". Let the other person draw the generic conslusion. Let the child maintain a sense that they are the one who decides their self worth rather than being dependent on another person's opinion. <br />See for example, The Six Pillars of Self Esteem by Nathanial Brandon for a good discussion of these issues.<br />Apart from those points, an excellent book.	2003-12-30

I gave the summary chart from this to my daughter, and asked her to score me and my wife. We found it very useful. I think any open minded parent would benefit from reading this, because no-one is perfect.<br />The book is practical and not judgemental. My only quibble is that some of the dysfunctional behaviours described in the book are not really 'controlling' so the title is slightly misleading. Having said that, there is plenty of material on controllers and this is the focus of the book. <br />So many self help books are not that helpful... <br />In many cases they seem to be about helping people blame others for their problems. Even if others are responsible in large part, people need to take ownership of solving their problems, and many of the books do not help with that. <br />In other cases, I see self help books being used by abusive people as manuals and cookbooks for justifying and extending their abusive behaviour. See the reviews of &quot;Boundaries&quot; by Henry Cloud for some examples.<br />This one is for people who actually want to understand and solve their problems. Highly recommended.	2003-12-19

People who think they are &quot;too kind, too giving&quot; are often nothing of the kind. People who feel they are weak are often tyrants.<br />People who feel their boundaries are too weak often run all over others in reality.<br />The individual I referred to above is still choosing all her daughter's clothes at almost 15 years old. For some reason the daughter finds this infuriating.<br />As for the actual material in the book I found it shallow and vacuous.<br />If someone recommends this book, run - do not walk - to a safer place.	2003-12-17

I would recommend this to men for that reason. For those still living in the 1960s, men and women are different.<br />I have seen many of the sort of controlling women that the book is aimed at: the ones who micromanage their husbands and are never happy with them. The message is that if your husband is not good enough, leave. If he is one of the good guys, he wants to do the right thing if you will get off his back and give him some room.<br />Every chapter is full of helpful comments and insight to help make this work.<br />It is not about turning yourself into a doormat, at all. There are chapters on setting limits, communicating your needs, etc.<br />The almost violent reaction of some of the reviewers suggests that the author has hit a nerve. I think some of the reviewers see themselves well described in the book - like the author who describes herself as a feminist and former shrew. Some obviously never even read it, preferring to assume they knew what it would say.<br />Not prefect but worth a read. I bought it as a joke and then didn't read it for a long time because the title is so corny. Glad I did. If you take the message broadly there are messages for men too. Treat your wife with respect and do the right thing, work toward intimacy.	2003-11-01

For this reason some readers are likely to be upset by the book e.g. devotees of Elliot Waves, Gann's methods and other nonsense.<br />The important topics are covered extremely well i.e. money management, what IS important, what is snake oil, some of the realities of trading such as slippage, why over 90% of traders lose all their money, etc.<br />Most books on investing are thinly disguised marketing exercises. <br />This one is different - the author is doing his best to share his hard earned learnings.

The numbers behind the graphs are not provided and are not available so you cannot do any further analysis yourself. The graphs themselves are also drawn in such a way that it is hard to extract the numbers using a ruler.<br />2. The problem of survivorship bias. They claim that while the 16 countries analysed are an incomplete list (only 70% of world GDP in 1900), this is not a big problem, they feel. Their message that stocks do well in the long run supposedly remains intact, however they do not provide any solid evidence of this. The countries left out of course suffered terrible performance, with total confiscation of assets in most cases and major losses in others.<br />The countries left out include: Russia, China, Eastern Europe, Latin America. As an example, Argentina was the wealthiest country 100 years ago but was left out. They claim that their criterion for inclusion was the availability of data, but Switzerland was included even though the data is incomplete.<br />In my opinion, some attempt should have been made to adjust for this problem.<br />3. No assessment is made of the issue of capital controls etc as an impedement to implementing the world indexing strategy. It is simply assumed that equal dollar indexing could be implemented without any costs, and with no taxes.<br />All in all, this book fails to provide a realistic and convincing assessment of global investment returns in the real world.<br />Victor Niederhoffer uses this book to justify his bullishness on stocks, Sorry Vic, no cigar.	2003-07-14

I have now read it three times.<br />It appears he has made a genuine advance in understanding financial bubbles and crashes. <br />However reading the book does require that you are prepared to think. If you are after someone telling you what to buy or sell, this is not the book for you.<br />Yes there is some math but you really can skip it without losing too much. The quotes that people have included in their reviews are minor asides that merely point the interested to further related material.<br />Some others have commented that his predictions have not all worked out. This is all discussed at length in the book; in such a field predictions are not infallible. About 40% of market crashes are caused by external events and so are not predictable. However he seems to have the S&amp;P500 worked out. Last years he predicted a choppy rally in 1Q2003, then from 2Q2003 a major fall ending in 1h2004. So far so good.	2003-04-08

Niederhoffer's egotism and hubris can grate at times and the book is somewhat self serving e.g. the circumstances that led to his quitting squash for five years were not quite as they seemed. <br />However there is a lot of good material and if you like ideas you will enjoy the way he ties many different fields back to trading. Some of the ideas are baloney but many are not. I found it useful because it does give a lot of insight into how a top trader thinks. <br />From reading the book it was quite obvious he would blow up at some stage, which he has in fact done. <br />The chapter on the ecology of markets is worth the price alone. Also the one on the interconnectness of markets, and on deception and gamesmanship. <br />However this should definitely not be your only book on trading. There is hardly any useful material on risk management.<br />Worth a read IMO but a lot of people will not like it i.e. those looking for a cookbook approach to easy wealth.	2002-04-06

Often even good fund managers are not entirely consistent. <br />An example of a strategy is: from the stocks with<br />12 month EPS gain &gt;20% and<BR>26 week % price change&gt;20% and<BR>Last Qtr EPS % chg &gt; 20% and<BR>Valueline Timeliness Rank &lt;=5<br />Pick the ten stocks with highest estimated EPS growth for next year .<br />He explains how to do all this in detail and derives some good looking strategies. Risk is taken into account and proves to be a very useful measure of the reliability of a strategy.<br />You can use the same techniques to evaluate your broker's recommendations, and the advice from books and newletters. Do they follow a strategy or is it just random tips and hunches?<br />He also showed how various fund managers changed strategy quite radically without announcing it eg Magellan in the early 1990s. <br />There are some good tips on how to avoid common traps when using quantitive strategies eg using single variable strategies. <br />He also explores combining various strategies and shows how to build your own. <br />He did not really prove his theory which is that noone really makes money by individual stock picks, it is all strategy. <br />As a final caveat, if you don't like numbers you will not like this book. But it seems you cannot succeed in investment without being very friendly with numbers.	2001-11-16

However it does not have much useful or practical information on managing knowledge. <br />He describes the problem pretty well but there is not enough on solutions.	2001-10-03

I ama beginner with scheme, though I have written LISP and Haskell before. <br />The parts of scheme I already understood it did not really clarify much, and the parts I did not understand it did not usefully explain. In that sense it did not match the promise of the title: other books in the &quot;The X Programming Language&quot; model do actually introduce you to the language in a usable manner. <br />For example the sections on macros and continuations are models of terse unclarity. In general the book fails to clearly explain new concepts, and even the early examples are too advanced for a book which is meant to explain the programming language.<br />This book may be of some use to someone who is a reasonably advanced scheme programmer who wants to get a few new ideas.<br />However as an introduction to scheme it is in my opinion a total failure. I felt it was more of a vehicle for the author to show off all the nifty coding hacks he could invent than a disciplined attempt to produce a useful book. <br />There are numerous better introductions to the language on the web, and the R5RS or R4RS documents do a better job of telling you what is in the language.	2001-10-01
