I never really cared for enough of the characters to really connect to the book, and whenever there was a glimmer of amusement or cleverness, it passed as quickly as it had begun.  I never mind literary vagueness, but most of the points in the story were just a tad *too* vague.  That having been said, I will comment that the ending of the book did please me - I won't give it away for future readers, but what Laurel does with her life is an enormous relief; had she done otherwise I would probably have dashed the book against a wall!	2000-12-16

What happens to Jane makes you consider the way you live life - do you just keep things in order and calm, or do you toss in a radical upheaval here and there?  Barnes has written with beautiful description and the story flows quickly.  Definitely worthy of its Pulitzer...	2000-12-10

Both of her protagonists and their unlikely love stories (each with a respective twist at the end) are enjoyable and touching, and there are aspects and trueisms Lurie writes of which everyone can relate to.  The detail of London is delightful and the moments of alternating humor and lonliness are well-balanced.  Fully worthy of the Pulitzer, and yet sometimes feels like light fiction.  Really enjoyable.	2000-11-22

In Arrowsmith, he has created a protagonist who is not without flaws, but has good intentions.  Also a wonderful story for people who enjoy medicine or the medical world.  (But you don't have to to enjoy the book!)  After reading it, I'll want to check out some of Lewis' other works.	2000-10-17

At times, this was an enjoyable, very interesting journey through one woman's life, through each decade of the 1900s.  At others, it becomes a little odd, with the tangents about some of the other family members and distant relatives.  The writing style switches narrators and tenses quite often, until at the final pages there was a reference made in the first person by a narrator whose name I did not even know.  It's never a confusing book, just sometimes frustrating.  Overall, the journey through the lives of the characters is special and I did not feel the lesser for having read it.	2000-10-01

I don't criticize those who do; I just don't myself.  And that's what this novel is like - pages upon pages concerning little happenings that lead up to and then follow the death of family man Jay.  Quibbles about religion, food, funerals, hearing...while the scope of the story contains genuine feeling, it's just not enough for me.  And, sadly for the reader, author Agee died before truly completing his work on the novel.  The editors have now tacked passages Agee had written (but not yet included) onto the ends of each section; it strikes me as invasive, somehow - who knows what Agee would have done with them?  Maybe he wouldn't have put them in after all...I just felt like I wanted to see more of what his original plan was.  It's a good book and for some (as apparent from the many positive reviews) it will speak volumes and touch souls.  It just didn't do it for me.  But, it's in no way something that's unreadable or bad.  It's most interesting, surely.	2000-09-30

Momadays' novel is often complex and overlapping, like waves upon a shoreline.  The narrative jumps from one mild plot point to the next, eventually converging into the great sea of one man's restless existence as both a modern man and a tradition-bound Indian.  Overall, it is a book which leaves impressions rather than coming out and whacking one in the head with statements.	2000-09-29

The novel gives us a glimpse into the underhanded, controlling, backstab-your-own-kin tactics of politicians and their cronies, and that is always enjoyable.  Sometimes the book becomes a bit long and plodding, but other times it is a pageturner.  And, as I said before, Warren writes with a beautiful turn of phrase.	2000-09-29

The story of a period in the life of a family of farmers in the Depression era raises some interesting questions on life and the reasons for why things happen the way they do.  Often lonely and sad in its tone, Johnson still tries to instill in her narrator a sense of not hope, but not despair either.  It's an interesting work but not one of my favorites.	2000-09-26

The story of the lives of the members of the Carver family and the profound effect a move from Nashville to Memphis has on them is unforgettable.  By the novel's end the reader is left with so much to consider, from the relationships of the characters to their motivations and eventual lifestyles.  And unlike one of the last books I read, Philip Roth's American Pastoral, which also chronicled the life of an American family, Taylor's book is beautifully written but yet simple and clear - no egotistical self-loving prose here!  I would actually plan on reading some of Taylor's other works, this was so enjoyable.  You won't forget this one.	2000-09-23

Alongside  of that, Wharton has written a moving portrait of a man who realizes too  late that he wishes to break away from the customs of this society, and of  the woman whom he feels is his spiritual equal, but whom he cannot  ultimately have.  It's timeless and quite simply, bittersweet and  beautiful.  Completely deserving of the Pulitzer.	2000-09-20

When the above was part  of the story, I was compelled to read.  However, the other 3/4 of the book  strike me as self-indulgent passages Roth included simply to show just how  well he thinks he writes, and how all-inclusive his research and knowledge  can be.  These passages often trudge along slowly and take the reader away  from the main plot at hand.  This could have been a 5-star, very  disturbing, fascinating study, which at times it is - but altogether, it  walks the line between the aforementioned to being a pompous bore.	2000-09-19

Wouk's story of a young man aboard a WWII minesweeper and the influence of  its Captain on the lives of crew is absolutely engrossing.  It's got a  little bit of everything - psycological studies, boy-grows-up-becomes-man  story, a little romance, and a whole lot of characters you feel you come to  know by the book's finish.  While I was reading it, I loved it, but only  when I closed the cover on the final page did I realize just how much I was  going to miss the Caine and its people and their lives.  It's a terrific  classic no one should miss.	2000-09-18

I'd intended to save this one until the end, because for some  reason I was under the (much mistaken) impression that it was going to be  boring.  Boy, shows you first impressions aren't always right!  This is a  heartwarming and yet bittersweet story - you wish there were more people  out there like the Major and less people like the General, and the types  they represent.

Which isn't to give the impression that the book is  a dry or moralistic account of people's lives - on the contrary, it is  fast-moving and very real.  It explores the life of Father Kennedy and his  own private struggles, and the lives of the Carmody family of his  childhood, and by the end of the book, you wish O'Connor would have  continued for another 200 pages telling us more about what happens to each  character...excellent reading.	2000-09-07

Roger sees their lives change - some for the better, some  worse - and how it affects his own life.<br />This is a wonderful story which  reminds me at times of E.L.  Doctorow's Ragtime, in that it encompasses the  scope of life in early twentieth century New York, and the lives of the  people who inhabit it.  The descriptions are vivid but never too  cumbersome; the characters are all very real, and the plot flies by.  By  the end, I came to care about what happens to these people, and found I was  sorry when it was over.	2000-08-21

I'm not often even a fan of politics or political topics,  but this  amazing novel did more than a job at piquing my interest in the workings of  the Senate!  It's a masterpiece - dealing with very real, human people and  topics, their all-too-human reactions to events, political blackmailing,  backstabbing, and foolishness...the plot (with the exception of the Russian  Communist scare) is as fresh as any political or legal &quot;thriller&quot;  published today.  I couldn't put it down, and the next day I hit my local  old bookstore and picked up all of the sequels.  I was that engrossed and  wanted to continue with the characters' stories.

I liked the general plot behind this book - I love history and I love the  Gold Rush period.  And while I enjoyed quite a few of Jaimie and co.'s  adventures, sometimes I found the book a little gruesome (some of the  Indian segments), or just dull (the extended Mormon sequences).

While I always know there's so much more background to be found in any  source material, I found my interest in the various stories ranged from  extreme enjoyment (the stories involving Nellie, Emile, Emile's daughters,  Joe Cable, the &quot;passionate&quot; doctor, and Bill Harbison) to vague  interest (most of the Tony Fry stories) to just plain disenchantment (the  sacrificial Boar story).  I suppose part of it stems from the fact that in  general I happen to not enjoy war stories, the exception being The Killer  Angels which I also recently read.  Just a personal note, so if you are the  type who doesn't agree, well, there you go. :)  Overall, I found that when  I enjoyed a story, I really enjoyed it - and when I didn't, I tended to be  slightly bored by the writing.  I was absolutely a little disappointed  since it was one of the Pulitzers I was looking most forward to reading;  though I do feel the scope and portrayal of the people and events do  warrant the award.	2000-08-12

I so much enjoyed getting  glimpses into the minds of the men behind the battles; their quirks,  memories, and different ideas of what they were fighting for.  And it  didn't matter that I knew the outcome of the battles - I was just as  fascinated by the decisions and at times almost forgot the history anyway!   That, to me, speaks volumes for the writing.  This is definitely an  engrossing book, and I believe that even if you were not prone to reading  Civil War/historical fiction type books, you would still enjoy this one.	2000-08-06

At times I read it and felt utterly depressed at the way the events  would spiral into a downward pit of despair for many of the people.   However, that's not to say that I didn't like the book - I did.  Immensely.   I almost couldn't put it down from the very start, and Mailer's vivid  descriptions were so well-done I could visualize almost everything.  The  explorations into the inner workings of various institutions, from the  prison system to the Hollywood-TV-media world, were fascinating, and of  course, the central story is well-written and utterly gripping.  I urge  anyone to read this...the story of Gary Gilmore and the people whose lives  he influenced will stay with you long after you have finished.	2000-08-06

The stories were  captivating, and at times imparted cultural bits of knowledge I had not  known.  At other times, they simply displayed people with raw human  emotions and needs; people whose fates I was interested to discover.  <br />I  still have ambivalent feelings on whether or not this deserved the Pulitzer  prize, because at times I do sense a sort of &quot;predictability&quot; in  the writing style and Ms. Lahiri's way of finishing each story with a bit  of a &quot;punch&quot;.  However, none of this detracted from the enjoyment  and I surely would commend to anyone who asked.	2000-08-05

Those are the words that ran through my mind when I read through the  mostly less-than-kind reviews of Millhauser's novel, a novel which I  finished in under 24 hours and couldn't stop thinking and reflecting on  afterwards.  I simply loved the story, even in its simplicity of style and  vastness of description.  To me, Martin's increasing dreams descend into a  kind of madness which quite perfectly speaks for almost any time period,  especially the current day, where the world is so obsessed with &quot;make  it bigger and better!&quot;.  Dressler's relationship with the three women  also decends into this madness, and where some people here seemed to not  understand Martin's actions in marrying Caroline, to me it was perfectly  clear.  And the girls were developed character-wise far enough to raise my  eyebrow more than once and wonder, &quot;Hmmm...is that what I think he's  hinting at?&quot;  Even Martin is not the world's most likeable character;  yet he makes you think.<br />In short, I do think this was a worthy and  thought-provoking novel.  I understand those who do not enjoy it, but I do  not count myself as one of them.	2000-08-05

Perhaps it was just the high expectations, but I didn't love this book as  much as some other literature of this time.  To its merit, I did think the  characters were well-developed; the depiction of the slow decline of the  Amberson fortune and the surrounding town into a crowding city was  absolutely excellent.  My only real complaint comes from the fact that at  times I just couldn't put aside a feeling of annoyance with the characters  - some of their foolishness frustrated me.  But then, I had to note that  any writing that raises a reaction in me, whether good or bad, has to mark  a good story.  It should also be noted that the story and the characters  leave an indelible mark on your memory...the story is as fresh in my mind  now as it was when finished it a few weeks ago.	2000-08-05

Thornton Wilder writes of a tragic bridge accident which takes the lives  of 5 people; he then proceeds to delve into the stories of three of these  victims.  Reading their histories leading up to their inevitable deaths  makes one ponder the meaning of fate - was it fate that these five die in  this way, at this time?  Was it just their time?

I can't say I didn't enjoy reading it - I did, actually - but in the way one  enjoys something with morbid fascination.  The plot is more than once  extremely contrived, and the constant references to &quot;present day&quot;  technology and ideas become entirely tedious after a few chapters.  Since  the characters are, after all, figments of the author's creation, I won't  comment on their general actions, save to say that some of them had me  either clucking my tongue, or outright laughing (try watching people look  at you as you laugh aloud whilst reading a book most know is intended to be  gruesome and horrifying - especially during one of Krendler's final  scenes).  I guess you could call it a guilty pleasure - I surely read it  quickly and enjoyed the process, but the book itself made me suspect it  wasn't Lecter injecting anyone with drugs, but rather Hollywood producers  injecting Harris with them.  Or, that Misery was stading aloft holding a  large axe and threatening him to bring Hannibal back.  <br />Alas, it did give  me a lot to say, which is more than some books do. ;)	2000-07-08

The story is fast and furious and the  &quot;chase&quot; is once again unconventional and gripping.  The narrative  in the eyes of Stevie Taggert is convincingly different than The Alienist,  from the eyes of John Moore.  In fact, my only real complaint is how here,  Moore seems to have turned into a whiny, complaining pain in the backside,  which he did not seem to be in the first novel.  (Of course, in the first  person, perhaps we're to believe Moore himself painted a better picture of  his behavior?  Curious.)  But it's a small complaint and I finished the  book hoping there will be perhaps another tale to tell in the world of  these wonderful characters.	2000-06-10
US	49834158	R2QRXO7JJMEQ32	0553572997	501395694	The Alienist	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Brilliantly written and enthralling	I remembered seeing many copies of this book toted by people a few years back, and finally gave it a whirl.  I'm pleased I did - it was written with the precision of a master, but yet not in a snobbish, show-off style.  The  characters are endearing and realistic and the historical aspects are  excellent.  The plot is truly gripping and the style of the investigation  is much deeper than the usual &quot;question and hunt&quot;.  Carr is a  master and I'm already more than halfway through the sequel to this,  &quot;The Angel of Darkness&quot;.  Don't miss either!	2000-06-07

I enjoyed the non-regulation (ie, no client for Kinsey) plotline, and personally enjoyed watching her track down and try and right  the wrong she'd felt she'd made.  The story was fast-paced and, I found at  the end, satisfying.  A good addition.  I don't know how I'll wait for 'P'!	2000-05-20

Grafton's depictions of the vicious, squabbling brothers and their estranged-now-saintly sibling are perfect.  The twist at the end was  predictable (or maybe I'm just onto Grafton's mindset now) but I loved it  nonetheless.  Couldn't put it down!  Don't miss it.	2000-05-18

I didn't really enjoy the catalyst for Kinsey's case, Selma - Grafton probably intended that since many of the townfolk  felt the same.  I prefer Kinsey when she works from Santa Teresa, but the  townfolk of Nota Lake were at least interesting.  And I had to chuckle when  Kinsey fired up that iron - it may not have worked, but there's ingenuity  at its best!  Enjoyable, especially if you're going through the series like  I am.	2000-05-18
US	49834158	R14Q2AHOE4TT6N	0449221490	810470150	L Is for Lawless (Kinsey Millhone Mysteries)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Total surprise	I wasn't looking too forward to this one based on the synopses I'd read.  I was surprised when 'L' grabbed me right in and kept me going literally until I finished it.  While the idea of Kinsey ingratiating herself and  &quot;being adopted&quot; by a fleeing band of outlaws is similar to 'H';  where the latter was rather dull, 'L' instead is compelling and light.   It's not as chilling or twist-filled as some of the others, but I found  myself wanting nonetheless to know how it was going to end, and how Kinsey  was going to get back to California!  Don't start with this one, but don't  skip it, either.	2000-05-08

Personally, 'K' is right up there with my other favoriteKinsey novels like 'A', 'C', and 'G' (for example).  Yes, maybe theending did come out of a hole in the wall (though I didn't consider it to have), but I nontheless found it enthralling.  Kinsey's all-too-human reaction to a certain occurrence toward this end struck me as chilling and realistic.  This one's a real page-turner, I found - I couldn't put it down.	2000-05-04
US	49834158	R2IJTIE12A2TFL	0449221482	753000717	J Is for Judgment (Kinsey Millhone Mysteries)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Another enjoyable romp	So 'J' isn't quite compelling enough to earn that 5-star rating, but it's still great and another key novel in regards to revealing some things about Kinsey's past.  I liked Grafton's use of having Kinsey infiltrate almost every character involved in the plot; even the &quot;villains&quot; such as  they are.  And despite it being the longest Kinsey mystery thus far, you'd  never feel it.  Definitely a no-miss.	2000-05-03
US	49834158	R1XPPECPL8QNVE	0449221512	209550266	I Is for Innocent (Kinsey Millhone Mysteries)	Books	4	8	9	N	N	Pretty great	&quot;I&quot; wasn't as fascinating as the usual Kinsey fare, but it was pretty damn good.  As noted before, there were so many characters who all seemed like a similar stock of wealthy socialites that it at times did feel  like they were cutouts of the same mold.  However, the plot was enjoyable  and the little subplot with Kinsey's landlord Henry was quite amusing.   Nice twist at the end, also, to the main plot.  Looking forward to  &quot;J&quot;!	2000-04-28

Other than that, the plot is really two-star fare, and anyone who sees I've been working my way through the series knows I've given high marks to all of them thus far.   This plot just wasn't chilling, mysterious, or really in any way a  page-turner.  Don't ever start with this one, and if you haven't the  tolerance to read every single Kinsey Millhone mystery, you could afford to  skip it.  And I don't say that lightly!	2000-04-18

I enjoyed the double plots and also very much liked how Grafton brought in many of the characters from past novels and fleshed them out a little.   Bringing back Dietz was a stroke of genius as it allows Kinsey to play off  of a male version of herself.  I see from other reviews that he will be in  future books - can't wait.  Overall the plot and suspense of the story were  one of the best...it's definitely a don't-miss in the Kinsey series.	2000-04-16

The twists are well-planted  and the plot ties up neatly.  The characters are also some of the most  developed thus far.  Can't wait to continue on with 'G'!	2000-04-14

My rating is really 3 1/2 stars, but it's not an option and 4 is 1/2 too many.  I actually had to will myself to sit down and read through this one, because I did find a lot of the beginning-middle dull and uninvolving.  For me, the story only picked up (and, admittedly, when it did, it SURE did!)  towards the last two-thirds of the book.  However, as I'm now working my  way through the series, this is in no way one you would want to skip over,  especially since it does give some real insight into Kinsey's past.  It  also does contain some of the funniest and also truest wry comments Grafton  has written.	2000-04-11

When I started 'D', I wasn't finding the plot to be among the most thrilling, especially having come from the captivating 'C'...however, there must have been something there because I shot through this one.  And, as  the title of my review says, the ending makes the entire story worthwhile.   It's not so much even the twist as it is the manner in which Grafton writes  it.	2000-04-08

I'm reading them in order, and after just finishing 'C' it is my favorite thus far.  The characters are engaging and extremely real, and Grafton really gets a handle on writing about their lives in this one.  Her wry  humor is never better, and the book speeds by.  There's even a subplot  which is as enjoyable as the main.  Don't miss this if you've been reading  the Kinsey Millhone mysteries.	2000-04-06

I found the plot to move slowly at first, and it didn't capture my attention nearly as well as 'A' did until the middle of the book.  Then things began to pick up the pace,  and I couldn't wait to finish it because I wasn't sure about the ending.   That's always fun for me, and it turned out to be a twist (in my opinion).   My only real complaint is that I felt like there was a loose end hanging  with the Danzingers.  Still and all, I enjoyed it and certainly would never  dissuade anyone who enjoyed 'A' and thought of continuing the series.	2000-03-31

This was perfect, and I wound up enjoying the  story so much I finished it in 24 hours.  True, it was fairly predictable -  I knew immediately who the &quot;big baddie&quot; was going to be, and the  supporters - but I enjoyed the fact that I had guessed so soon that I  actually didn't cheat and peek at the end, and instead highly enjoyed  seeing how and if my suspicions fit into the plot!<br />Don't buy it expecting  deep genius, but don't expect a dime store novel either.  It's right in  between and I had a fun enough time that I think I'll pick up the next one  in the series.	2000-03-23
US	49834158	R22DUF5XXKK67Q	0446607851	784906101	Citizen Washington	Books	5	2	4	N	N	Enjoyable	I got hooked on historical fiction after reading the Gore Vidal series.  Citizen Washington wasn't quite as good in my opinion, but it was still engaging and very enjoyable.  I liked the short narratives that still made  us involved with every character.<br />Could have used a little less battle  scenes in the latter half of the book, but then I've never been a fan of  them no matter where.  Overall I highly enjoyed the book.	2000-03-23
