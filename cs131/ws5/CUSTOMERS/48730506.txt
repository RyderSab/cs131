The rooms in the book don't look that bad, but they do look too &quot;studied&quot; and too &quot;new,&quot; and that is what  gives them the phony, showy, nouveau-riche look. I got the feeling that each room was almost created from scratch as if the people living in the rooms didn't start out with one decent heirloom or personal object. The author seems to have found rooms that generally show good use of square footage, so you can get some ideas from them. (I wasted money on this book so I am trying to make the best of it and glean what ideas I can from it.)	2003-12-23

It is a good read and food for thought. I have seen John Edward on Larry King several times and even Larry King, a professed agnostic, as am I, admits to being impressed with him. There are good stories and insights in this book. As an agnostic, I don't believe or disbelieve, but I KEEP AN OPEN MIND.

It's a dreamy look at cabins, which is great, but I had hoped it would go further in writing about the details of each home. There is very little information about the homes in this book, so the authors obviously considered it just a pretty picture book. Which it is. For my money, though, I wanted a little more. What I wanted but DID NOT GET was more information on choosing a cabin location, on having a new cabin designed and built, on remodeling an older cabin, and so forth. I wanted the pretty pictures as well as some information I could use. In researching second home books, the one I recommend is called simply SECOND HOME, and it not only works as a dream book but is chockful of informational tidbits that we are using as we plan our own retreat.	2001-10-09

I bought a copy, and I have enjoyed it. But that's as far as this book goes.<BR>However, I also bought a book called SECOND HOME, which I found on Amazon.com, and that has become our favorite getaway book. SECOND HOME inspires me with its lush photography of homes (and settings) around the country, but Second Home is equally valuable because it has so much information that keeps guiding us as we work toward turning out dreams into reality. (Second Home talks about how to shop for real estate, how to evaluate a small town or a region, etc. We liked the chapter that is a series of quizzes with dozens of photos to help you decide what kind of home or setting or view or climate you want. That was interesting to go through.)	2001-10-09

One architectural look runs through her books. I personally found the first NOT SO BIG HOUSE book depressing because the interiors tended to be so dark, woody, grim, and filled with dated furnishings that looked like 1970s rejects. I like the idea behind these books, which is getting away from builder junk and creating a home that has architectural integrity and greater function. The book I highly recommend in that vein is called SMALL HOUSE BIG STYLE, because it shows a true range of home styles and approaches.	2001-10-09

I had already bought the book and recommended it to others. The book is beautiful, shows homes that are both dreamy and accessible (versus out of anyone's reach), and then goes beyond those great home tours to include tips on everything from buying a site or a home to decorating and building. The book is always on my coffee table, because I often pick it up just to dream with. It's a pleasure to look at. But I'm also using the decorating ideas where we live now. My husband and I are marking pages that have informational tips we need and we're also putting sticky notes on pages that show homes, rooms, or furnishings that represent the home we plan to create.	2001-06-14

That is true. But this book is also a style book that captures all the elements of weekend style, getaway style, cottage style, cabin style, nautical style, farmhouse style, chalet style and everything in between. Those styles are not limited to vacation homes, per se. I doubt that I will have a second home, but I am taking ideas from this book, using them as a guide to giving my townhouse that weekend house feeling.	2001-05-23

Unfortunately, we grabbed this one (in hardcover) without spending enough time going through it first. The editors seem to have chosen those homes with no clue about what kinds of homes readers would relate to and what kind of information readers would want. For a much more satisfying mix of dreamy homes and helpful information, our #1 pick is a book called SECOND HOME: FINDING YOUR PLACE IN THE FUN. It lets us dream and relax but also puts us on the &quot;trail&quot; of our own getaway place.	2001-05-14

I have not seen all these homes, but I do recognize a few, which I am thrilled to see printed on book (versus thin magazine) paper and bound into a book I can keep forever. This book is so fresh, and while I lean toward the classic country looks, I love seeing newer, almost modern variations on the theme. Touring one house after another is a real treat, especially because the page size of this book is larger than most other decorating books I've seen.	2001-05-11

Our other favorite is Second Home, which is great for both daydreaming and planning. Second Home shows a wider variety of homes around the country (all gorgeous) but blends information on choosing a location, decorating, and so on, into the book. Seaside Interiors gives a lovely look at homes with no information on how to make your second home come true. I like both books. If you can only buy one, then I recommend Second Home instead.	2001-01-30

This book does that. But it also has a personal quality that is unique. From cover to cover, the author stops to give information that I can use to shop for real estate or even to decorate. What I haven't seen other reviewers mention is the unique chapter (this is what I think is so much fun) that is actually feeding my daydreams with open-ended questions about where I might like to live, what kind of view I really want (and does my husband agree with that or not). That fun chapter has lots of great pictures of homes as well as second-home settings. One question asks something about where I see myself walking in my second home dreams, which is a fun thought--some possible answers, illustrated with pictures, are a golf course, a snow-covered path, a garden, and that sort of thing. It was fun to compare my answers with my husband's. The book has an interactive quality that other getaway and vacation home books do not have. I highly recommend this.	2001-01-29

I get so many ideas every time I open it up. I like the variety of styles and the sophisticated yet simple ideas. The book is empowering, because it helps me choose ideas that are right for me and then helps me carry those out. I mean, one week I got thet simplest little room arranging tip that made all the difference in our boxy living room. Another time, we just painted the dining room walls in a weekend and wrapped the chair seats with new fabric for a &quot;new&quot; room that cost very little money. This is a great book for anyone.	2001-01-23

I don't. Mixing is one thing, but being tasteless is another. If you want to simply create a jumble of you-know-what, which is what this book shows, then you don't need this book at all. If want to be inspired to invest more taste and personality than money in your rooms and are a creative spirit, chances are you will prefer Flea Market Decorating, Flea Market Style, or American Junk. Personally, the new book, Flea Market Decorating, is my favorite -- fun, sophisticated, inspiring.	2001-01-11

We are hoping to buy or build our own second home in the next few years, and this book is helping us decide what we really want and where we really want to spend our free time. In the meantime, though, the book itself is like a little getaway. I pick it up, sit back in my favorite chair in the den, and get absolutely lost in all the photos of real homes around the country. Typical of Better Homes and Gardens, the homes are inspiring yet realistic, stylish but not pretentious. The homes are warm and inviting, and the book is absolutely lovable. I don't know when I've been so thrilled with a new book. Take me away, Second Home!	2000-12-05

THE NEW COTTAGE HOME shows architecturally stylish homes, most of which are modest in size. It's a nice dream book but you can pick up lots of ideas for your own home within it.   SECOND HOME is the other book we just bought. It has wonderful photography of second homes around the country but goes beyond that to include tips on deciding what location or home style is right for us, how to check out a neighborhood, and so forth. I've already learned (in the chapter on having a new second home built) that we can have our architect design a house and then save money by having a modular home company build it in a factory.

It's more  like a badly organized textbook on everything you didn't want to know about  Feng Shui than on simple, easy-to-apply principles that &quot;complete  idiots&quot; can apply to their homes. Too much background information  about which I don't care. Too little in the way of immediately useful  ideas. What I had hoped for was a sort of Cliff's notes on the topic with a  basic Feng Shui to-do list, but what I got was page after page (after page)  of theory and tables. If you are looking for an education on Feng Shui and  don't care about being able to ferret out any useful ideas, buy this book.

(Amazon's price was better.) What I wanted (and got) was an excellent  decorating book but not a ditsy, cutesy book filled with projects. This is  a kind of interior design primer that seems to cover the bases of such  things as color and arranging accessories but with a yummy, cottage-style  focus. There isn't another book like it, and I've been looking. Very  helpful and also a wonderful book so flip through because the photos are  gorgeous.	2000-08-25
