As a former teacher, I can recommend this book highly to other teachers, sure, but friends, family, and parents as well. Rarely does a book come along that has something for everyone, but Gems for the Heart truly does, and that's saying a lot. Think about it: What other book have you bought recently where you can sit around the living room and read aloud for the entire family? Kids will love seeing themselves within its pages, and thrill to the fact that grown-ups are laughing, smiling, nodding, and sometimes even crying about what someone their age had to say on life, love, dinosaurs, reproduction ... and everything in between. How empowering! For your child ... and you!	2004-02-17

Now if that's not a great example of FATE, then I don't know what is. This book takes a look at and examines the &quot;hand of fate&quot; but, more importantly, how that hand is present in our daily lives. Its stories are unique, a cut above what you might find in other anthologies, and through them we discover that no matter what the story, how amazing or normal, we can somehow relate. The first thought that will pop into your mind is, &quot;Hey, something like that happened to me once ...&quot; And isn't that what great reading is all about???	2004-02-17

I have many more dreams and goals to obtain before crossing the finish line. This is likely to be the same for you. Whether your dreams are for financial success, starting a new business, or just getting a job and starting your own family, no one can determine whether you've won or lost in this magical game of life-except yourself.\\"<BR>~ Rob Pritts, FROM CP TO CPA <br />Despite your disability, you can achieve anything you set your mind to. Despite your disability, you are a valuable and contributing member of society. Despite your disability, you are a unique and special individual the likes of which the world has never seen. Sound to good to be true? It isn't. That's the feeling you'll get while reading Rob Pritts' triumphant new self-help book, FROM CP TO CPA: One Man's Triumph over Cerebral Palsy. <br />As a popular and inspiring motivational speaker on the subject of disability awareness, Rob Pritts makes no apologies for the fact the he has cerebral palsy. And why should he? From the start, Rob has never let CP slow him down or throw up barriers in the way of his many hopes and dreams. From a self-contained Special Education classroom to the University of Illinois, where Rob obtained a Bachelor of Science degree, to obtaining the CPA certification, Rob's experiences have allowed him to excel into what his former teachers call a \\"Special Ed Success Story!\\"<br />And now that Rob has excelled at his life's ambitions, he is eager to share his positive philosophy with other people with disabilities in his new book: FROM CP TO CPA: One Man's Triumph Over Cerebral Palsy! <br />From special education teachers to their students, from corporate CEOs to frustrated housewives, from churches to colleges, Rob's message is the same: Don't be discouraged by the cards you've been dealt. Instead, make sure you've always got a winning hand by facing each day with a positive mental attitude-and a humble sense of gratitude.<br />Rob mixes personal stories of his life as a disabled child, student, graduate, and professional CPA with easy-to-digest lessons aimed at awakening the disability in us all. Followed by evocative journal prompts, FROM CP TO CPA becomes more than just a book, it evolves into an interactive journey through our very souls. <br />Reading Rob's book is not always easy. Whether you're disabled, or someone without a disability, facing up to your own misconceived notions or perhaps even prejudices is a direct result of Rob's illuminating prose and self-effacing humor. Yet I dare you to walk away from this book uninspired, and as such it makes the perfect tool for facing life more positively when you've been feeling down or uninspired.	2002-10-15

Insights from One Woman's Journey as the Wife of a Widower	Books	5	11	15	N	N	Wives of Widowers (WOWs) Sure to Find Comfort in New Book!	Losing a spouse is never easy, and being labeled a widower brings with it its own unique set of obstacles and challenges. Fortunately, bookstore shelves are littered with books on how to cope with grief and come to grips with life-as a widower. But what about for the woman who marries a widower!? <br />In her new book, Past: Perfect! Present: Tense! Insights From One Woman's Journey As The Wife Of A Widower (Weyant Press, 2002), author Julie Donner Andersen has, perhaps for the very first time, penned a revolutionary new self-help book that offers readers a personal glimpse into the life of a \\"WOW,\\" or Wife Of a Widower. <br />\\"Our WOW angst about the late wife, and issues that arise because of her, make us seemingly petty and unrealistic to the outside world, but nothing could be further from the truth. We care deeply about the feelings of her survivors, and often about the late wife herself,\\" says author Julie Donner Andersen on the plight-and common stereotype-of WOWs.<br />Indeed, PPPT is so chock full of information, it seems that Andersen has left nothing out. Chapter titles include What to Expect, Living with the Past, Holidays and other `Grief Triggers,' Embracing the Late Wife, His Kids: Becoming a WOW Stepmother, Comparing the Second wife and the WOW, and Beating the Odds. <br />The chapters are written in an unassuming and honest tone, and while Andersen certainly shares the details of her own struggles-and triumphs-as a WOW, she is careful to provide just as many personal stories from contributors and interviewees as well. The docu-drama style works well with this material, providing many various sides of the same basic coin. <br />The ultimate insider, Andersen writes with both compassion and grace. Never afraid to touch the sensitive issues, she slowly but surely pulls the veil that has formerly covered the \\"taboo\\" subject of WOWs, and in so doing shares with us not only her story, but perhaps our own as well. A wonderful resource for not just WOWs butanyone experiencing the ups and downs of a blended family, or even coping with grief.	2002-10-13
