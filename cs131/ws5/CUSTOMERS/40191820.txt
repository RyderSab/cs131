Although critics do have some merit to the argument that his characters lack the definition of other, more mirthful novels, Brown uses a healthy sampling of wit, intelligence, and anecdotes to keep a reader turning the over 400 pages of this book.<br />To argue that this book is not worth buying because of the historical inaccuracies is MISSING the point of a FICTIONAL novel; it's make-believe!  Brown twists the facts to suit his own purposes as a story-teller; doing just that seems to be Brown's call to guard.<br /> He does a splendid job keeping this novel moving, and his tempo never wavers.<br />I was fully satisfied with my purchase (once I realized that I couldn't expect an acutely accurate historical nonfiction work from a middle-aged novelist), and I would be confident in saying that you will too.	2003-12-31

Although the Time Almanac may not be as comprehensive as per se, the Oxford Almanac, the relatively inexpensive price of this almanac (divided by the amount of information it possesses), makes it an excellent deal.<br />This book has almost anything a reader could ask for (within reason; if you're looking for the genealogy of the dentist of the man who found uranium, then spend 90 dollars on Oxford).  I was very happy with my purchase, as well as some of the anecdotes which this particular almanac provides (such as biographies of famous people, and a particularly well put-together section on US states.)	2003-12-31

It is no wonder that such an interesting storyline as this was adapted into a movie.<br />His characters are actually MORE developed by the end of the book than are the characters in his more popular novel, making this book, ironically, a better read.<br />I would recommend this book to almost anyone, especially fans of the &quot;Da Vinci Code&quot;	2003-12-31

As many Pullitzer prize winning books often fall to high expectations, alas, there is one which does not.  Samantha Power's amazingly well researched analysis of American (and worldly) foreign policy during times of genocide is a rare breed, in that it delivers to the level which any &quot;gold star&quot; book is expected to.<br />Power, a highly qualified author for a book on a subject like genocide, obviously had great passion for the premise behind this book.  Each argument she sets forth is backed up not only with hard evidence (which believe me, there is a bounty of), but also of her own experiences.  Therefore, this book flows like a novel, but has the logicality of a textbook.  <br />The one area in which this book loses some points (and it is not a glaring problem, but forced me to give a 4, since 5 merits only near perfection), is that a few of Power's assertions (mostly in the chaper on Kosovo) are highly debatable.  She begins to disregard the obstacles which the U.S. government faced.  This disappointed me because her other assertions took into full-mind these problems.  However, as I stated just one moment ago, ten of her eleven chapters are carefully thought out.<br />In the end, I feel that anyone who wishes to offer an informed view of American foreign policy must read this book.  It includes a wealth of information which proves Power's bold claims, and as a result does not leave much room for an equally respectable retort.  Secondly, this book, like almost every Pullitzer Prize winner in the nonfiction category, is superbly written in stark and powerful prose.	2003-12-23

White's &quot;Elements of Style&quot;, the great American author praises those few writers who can relay great emotion through the simplest of prose.  If Mr. White had been alive to read Yann Martel's &quot;Life of Pi&quot;, this book would have warmed his heart.<br />The winner of the Booker Prize, &quot;Life of Pi&quot; is a story about the innate necessity of survival, the ability to find one's inner-self, and the importance of cooperation and coexistence.<br />Incorporated in succint prose, Mr. Martel relays his story through both straight-foward dialogue as well as many cunning metaphors.  He passes his own brand of social agenda as well, and one must read this book with a careful eye in that regard.  However, I do not say that to deter any readers from picking up this book.<br />&quot;Life of Pi&quot; earned its many praisings through excellent writing and an almost philosophical premise.  Of any book published in 2002, this is certainly one of the more insightful novels.	2003-12-23

The Russian prison which by uttering the very word which was its name would create tension throughout a room. American propoganda fueled Clancy's awe for the system during the Cold War period.  The next in line happened to be a journalist named Anne Applebaum.<br />&quot;Gulag&quot; is an important book for understanding the truths and lies spread by Americans about the Russian system of high-security imprisonment.  The book does not salute any actions taken by the Russians but does manage to dispel a few of the rumors along the way.<br />For anyone with interest in the old Soviet Union and more specifically the infamous gulag, this is a MUST read.  And for those who are only interested in finding a fact or two to spice up a conversation, this book is written in such a way which is lucid and intelligently pleasing to the brain.	2003-05-25

This book does neither.  Bruce only offers the same stereotypical arguements for controversial views that we've heard millions of times before.  And even when she does have an acutely original thought, it fails to prove to the reader that she is right.<br />It's an unflinching look at today's most diluted political and social issues, and for that Bruce receives a few stars.  But beyond that, I would not recommend this book.<br />(I am not completely through this rather long book- about 3/4, but seeing as it sells so well, I thought I should forewarn people.)	2003-04-24

By the end of the book all readers will have a better understanding not only of the man, but more importantly, the effect the man had on his people and the world.<br />I would highly recommend this book to any historical enthusiasts or anyone else even remotely interested in the Soviet Union.<br />(I would also recommend Mark Remenick's &quot;Lenin's Tomb&quot; as a preface to reading this book.)	2003-04-23

The Mission is simply a researched backing of what we all knew already: our military is not comprised of compassionate humanitarians, nor should they be wholly responsible for making policy decisions.<br />The book is not quite as fabulous as the hype, but its interesting.

That too was my first reaction when I read the New York Times Book Review of this book; and for the most part, I wasn't suprised.<br />Zakaria is an intelligent political analyst with a gift at subtely seducing you into believing (or accepting) his sometimes extreme opinions.  In his latest book he topples probably his most extreme view- that democracy is not the 'golden shrine' of governmental order.  <br />The American Dream since the end of the 20th century has now transformed itself into globalization, and the belief that democracy is the fundamental pillar to a successful society.  Zakaria challenges this idea through a series of theories, each of which include one or two examples.  He has a bland way of expressing these ideas, but the very fact that he is proposing them is gutsy, and for that the book is enjoyable to read (whether in the end you believe him or not.)<br />If you are one who blindly quotes de Tocqueville and company without considering the potential risks inherent in democracy, this should be the first book on your reading pile.  Not only will it challenge you, but, ironically enough, may (like it did to me), only make my views on democracy more credible (I now have seen the most sensible arguements against democracy, and I feel prepared to rebuke whatever comes my way).  I put this book down as millions of thoughts raced through my head.  Zakaria has written a wonderful nonfiction book that will make you think, and finally, have a much more well informed opinion (whatever it may be) when you are finished.	2003-04-13

However, John Hersey's promise of opening the world's eyes to the horrors of the \\"bomb\\" is fulfilled to the very last sentiment in this classic book.<br />This book was simply a school assignment for me, I honestly can say I would not have read it otherwise.  Nevertheless, after reading it I began to question my indifference towards World War II, and even more- the threat of nuclear war.  Bombs like the \\"A-bomb\\" have never fallen on the USA, and that may be why most Americans don't blink at the mention of atomic warfare.<br />For those of you who have two or three hours to spare, and are interested in the chaos that about 10 pounds of uranium and 5 pounds of radium can create, this is a succint and timeless novel (which would pass for a mass-biography) which will hopefully remain on college and high school English cirriculums for years to come.	2003-03-31

I first read this book mostly because I had an interest in how 'the other half thought.'  So I went in with an open mind, expecting to have my beliefs challenged by what I was told was a thought provoking portrayal.<br />However, for all of those who can relate to my story, do not invest in this book.  Although Patterson is a gifted story teller, that is simply all this book is- stories.  Patterson spends an indordinate amount of time on Clintons personal life, and not enough adressing how his direct diplomatic decisions hurt America.<br />In the end, this book is a worthwhile read for Republicans and anti-Clintonians who are looking to relate to a well regarded figure.  However, if like me, you are looking to rethink your 20th century analyzations, this book is not as good as advertised.	2003-03-19

However, this is NOT what the book gives in the end.<br />Lind writes excellent backdrop pieces on certain aspects of the Vietnamn War, so if you are young, and have not experienced the Vietnamn War times, this book is not only thought provoking but is also worth reading for good, analytical and factual knowledge of Vietnamn.  Nevertheless, 'Vietnamn: The Necessary War' is just like every other opinionated book on Vietnamn.  As a matter of fact, Lind only bluntly discusses his thesis in the first chapter, and then spends the rest of the book telling you, the reader, where we were mistaken.<br />It's a good book, a little tough to digest, but still very informative.  But you should be forwarned before you invest the money in buying it.	2002-07-26

(If you read the book you may understand the irony).  I picked this book up one night and did not put it down- a few hours later I had read through one of the best books I have ever seen.<br />Tuesdays with Morrie is an awe inspiring novel about a young mans experiences with a dieing professor.  Morrie (the professor) uses his death as giving him the right to talk to everyone about things they would not normally talk about... and to pass on his theories about life to his favorite student.  Morrie slowly teaches Albom about what it means to live, versus what it means to live meaninglessly.  This book brings up many interesting points, some of which may make you think back on your life.  <br />Tuesdays with Morrie is an American classic in my opinion.

Firstly, about the program in general.. Macromedia Flash 5 costs around 400 dollars.  The book includes a test demo, but this demo IS NOT LONG ENOUGH TO GIVE YOU HANDS ON TRAINING FOR THE DURATION OF THE BOOK.  Fortunatly my students were allowed to used borrowed copies of the software to complete this book.<br />Now that I have placed my two warnings on the table, I must say that this book with the proper study and participation (using the Flash 5 screen right in front of you) can make for an ideal Dummies book.  All of my students found this book instructional, and a few of them even went as far to say it was the best Flash book on the market.  In same areas, I must agree with them.  <br />First of all- despite the criticism that this book is hard to follow at times- it makes Flash 5 programming quite simple.  Flash is not an easy program to use effectively, and without reading this book you may get lost in a clutter.  <br />Secondly, this book is in my opinion one of the only TWO Flash 5 books you should EVER read.  The other book is Macromedia's own instructional book for advanced users.  Other books give you nothing but repitition from an inferior writer...<br />Get this book if you are serious about improving and using Flash 5; otherwise you are wasting your time	2002-05-21

However, like most great ideas, variations of the same concept were adopted.  In the case of internet lingo, O'Reilly's and The Complete Idiot's guides were created.<br />I have read both the O'Reilly and the For Dummies book, and after completing both of them (I am an advanced J-Script user), I found the O'Reilly book, although not geared specifically towards beginners, as the more instructional book.  It gives typical O'Reilly plans and lessons that will guide you to being an earnest Java Script writer. <br />The main problem with the For Dummies book is its lack of direction for the overall web constructor.  The author advertises Java Script as the ideal programming language, and in doing so has written chapters on how to do things in this language which I, and many other professional web designers feel should not be done.<br />Therefore, keep yourself away from this book until you have read a truly introductory book, as well as a book like O'Reillys... after that you should DEFINETLY buy this book as a reference because of the vast amount of intermeddiate knowledge it has.	2002-05-21

That pretty much sums up this book by Pachman.  <br />Most chess books are naturally dense.  It is a fact that when you try to explain in words your plans in a chess game, someone, somewhere will find it hard to comprehend.  But despite this against him, Pachman wrote a book that was not too difficult for ANYONE to understand.  (I tested this by having my son read it, he is a Class D player.)<br />This book isn't filled with interesting positions or mind-boggling concepts for the advanced player.  But if you are reading chess books as a novice player, looking to grasp a few &quot;cool&quot; ideas, this is a great book for you.  <br />(It lost one star from me for it's simplicity; but if you are a Class C or below, this is a 5 star.)<br />[This book could raise a Class C and below's ELO by 100-150 points if studied well enough.]	2002-04-24

David did such a great job on this novel, that within 3 hours of collecting it, I am almost finished.  <br />The reading of the book entrances you into what exactly is sanity, and how easy it is for one to loose themself in paranoia and love.  <br />The characters are good, and Professor Mullins was named after the junior English instructor. :)  <br />I highly recommend this book, not because this author attended my high school, but because this is a brilliant piece of psychological entrapment.	2001-11-15
