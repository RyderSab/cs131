Wonderful short stories that are a very good look at today's British writers. These aren't traditional mysteries like Agatha Christie, but that's not whats being written today and it's not representative of todays world. <br /> <br />In particular I loved the fact that all the stories are a bit different from one another. You definitly can not judge the whole collection by one story.	2005-02-21

Later I became a mystery and thriller reader. For me, Ian Smith's debut novel featuring Sterling Bledsoe captured my past, my imagination and my thriller reading heart. As a first story this novel is engaging, keeps you turning pages and has a very unique plot line. As a thriller, this book is great for the following reasons; the plot isn't the predictable points a and b add up to point c. Smith throws curves at his reader,addresses the improbability of a brother investigating his brother's murder with an awe shucks, it could happen aplomb that is heartening in the same way the first Michael Connelly and Jack Reacher books were. Sterling Bledsoe is welcome as a new protagonist on my T.B.R. pile. I cannot wait to see where Smith goes from here.	2004-06-29

For years D'Amato has written wonderful mystery books.Great and timely plots with engaging characters. This time, she blew me away. I cannot explain the difference between a favorite author writing another very good book and an author looking into themselves and pulling out a great read. This book is that and more. Perhaps the best police procedural I've read this year. The relationship between our two police is so on the money. The tale horrific. And the setting oozes out of the pages to create a story. You cannot help but feel the heat radiating off of the Chicago concrete. Hawthorne house, where the action begins, is portrayed at the very beginning of the tale from the point of view of several of our players. It is one of the best \\"settings as a character\\" passages I have ever read.D'Amato isn't done with the reader at this point. For the murder victim is a pioneer in the treatment of autistic children and many of the suspects are his former patients. It is a locked room mystery with modern themes. D'Amato's best work to date. I would recommend this book above all others as the read of summer 2004.	2004-06-29

Unfortunately I tend to be more like a little kid with dessert and eat quickly, and then sit wanting more.  I mention this because this is similar to reading the latest Don Bruns book. Barbados Heat is wonderful and I wanted to make it last. I wanted to savor it. But I just couldn't. I read fast, like a reader starved for adventure through words. Bruns writes with an inviting style that makes you want to come in and stay a while. His characters are quickly old friends.<br />In this, his second book, the main character, Mick Sever is heading off on vacation to relax after his latest book tour. Mick is a writer who knows the music world well and first hand. And he writes about it like a true visionary. His vacation is quickly interrupted, in truth before it begins. His childhood friend Nick Shapply has been arrested for murdering his step-father. Senator Robert Sahppley had a lot of people who would like him dead<BR>but Mick is pretty sure Nick wasn't the one to do it. So with a deal for a story of the case, Mick sets to finding out what is going on and who did what.  His ex wife meets him in  DC to help with the writing. Full of intrigue, strange family matters and <BR>music insights.<br />This is a wonderful book and full of some very great moments.

I have had a moderate interest in the Ripper case for a long time. I have to be honest, I was disappointed with this book. It feels to me like her choice for the killer was predisposed, and she tilted the evidence to support this.<br />I also think that if you are going to take the time to research a subject and write a book of this size, it would be better to site the sources as you show the evidence, not just list sources at the end.<br />I think Ms Cornwell should stick to fiction, which is what this feels like to me.<br />If you want a better book on the subject, read From Hell. At least the authors of that don't make the claim to have the only answer, and they wrote something entertaining, not dry and boring.	2002-11-11

But it is darn interesting. The protaganist is a free lance detective who works for a system that he doesn't believe in, and that doesn't like him. But they do need him.  Quint is an outsider, even though his parents were behind the new government. <br />In this book, bodies are found with tapes stuck inside them. And since most music is outlawed.... well only an outlaw, or in this case outsider would recognize the music.This gives Quint an edge in investigating the crimes. <br />The story is well thought out, and the futuristic world portrayed in the books seems real. And the mystery writing is solid. Quint is a detective from the same school as Rebus, Amos Walker,and Harry Bosch. A bit of a smart [alec], cynical, self doubting. But also, very good at what he does. <br />This is a very entertaining read and well worth your time.<br />Jon	2002-03-07

A case he is working now stirs it up more than any other has.

It's not just hardboiled, It's rock hard. Full of short bursts of Detroit and the auto industry's history. Enough to educate, but not long enough to bore. Estleman's love of this city and surrounding area are very evident. This book is crime literature at it's finest.<br />Amos is hired by the widow of a Detroit industrialist to clear up some old family business. Along the way he gets tangled up with the steel haulers union, dirty cops, shady politicos, and the intrigue of a strange plan for extortion. Also along for the ride is his old friend Iris, who is running a shelter for abused women. Caught in the middle, a young boy. Walker handles this case like all his others, with the style of by gone era, making it timeless.<br />The book has a fast pace and never slows down. Walker's way of dealing with obstacles is as ever, down and dirty. I can safely say that this is by far my favorite in the series so far. Amos Walker at his best. And that's saying a lot, because Estleman is one the finest mystery writers writing today.<br />And the finish will knock your socks off.<br />Jon Jordan	2002-02-05

Jeff Talbot  is an interesting guy. He used to work for the FBI, and now lives in Seattle making his way in the world hunting antiques as a \\"picker\\".  I was able to understand much of this because it is very similar to hunting for books.  While reading this book, you learn to appreciate the knowledge needed to be a picker. So for this aspect alone, I loved the book.<br />But the book is much more than that. The characters are realistic and enjoyable, and the story is engrossing. I was drawn into it and stayed up much later than I planned reading the whole book  through to it's conclusion. <br />Jeff is on a quest. He's looking for a tea set with Napoleon ties, an object that has eluded a dear freind of his for years. He travels to an auction on Mackinac Island and plans to be the winning bidder. This being a mystery, of course things don't go as planned. Before long a body shows up. Some one Jeff knows. And he is drawn into the investigation. And then another body. And then some twists and turns and before long the teapot is second on Jeff's to do list.<br />I really loved this book. I didn't think I would like it as much as I did. It seemed that an \\"antique lover's mystery\\" would not be my kind of thing. Boy, was I wrong. This book is super, and since it's a paperback, there is no excuse not to buy it and enjoy it for yourself.	2001-12-16

The council brings him in to find the killer. He asks for and is given the assistance of a guardsman named Davie who is also a freind of Quint's. Together they investigate the murder, which turns into murders. Along the way there are illegal drugs, strange deaths, and  people hiding the truth. <br />The book is a great read. Social commentary mixed in by way of Quint's outlook on the future city, and who runs it. The story is tight and the investigative work believable.  Quint is a hardboiled detective typical of this fiction and fun because of it. The book wraps everything up in a wonderful ending that left me wanting more.  Which I will soon have, as I have ordered everything available by this author.<br />Jon Jordan	2001-11-26

And while it's not quite as polished as some other books out there, it's a darn good book. The protagonist is a Dr. Connor. He is a former medical examiner who is now teaching college. He also holds a PI license. In this first outing of a series, Dr. Connor is called in to consult on a case that starts with the mummified remains of a woman found in a walled up closet.  Through autopsy examination it is discovered that the woman was killed back in the fifties.  Teaming up with Detective Donaldson, Dr. Connor investigates the murder. <br />The book twists and turns and leads us through some history of the San Francisco area in search of the killer. The research shows.The ending was wonderful.  I look forward to more books from David Feeney and more of Dr. Connor.	2001-11-16

The book itself is beautiful, so I'll be looking for more from uglytown.

And the funeral is ruined by protesters. But they are not who they seem as Quince soon finds out by befriending the head of the group they claim to represent, Maria Casteneda.

And I know that I'll be buying Doolittle's next book	2001-10-15

I thought I would try one of his non-mystery books.<BR>I was amazed. The book takes us from one coast to the other during the time of the cival war. We see it through the eyes of a young musician on the run. Along the way we see Billy meet some famous folk of the old west, including the James Brothers, Custer, and Billy The Kid. It reads so real, that you want to check for the name Billy Gashade in history books. Estleman did his homework and it shows.A history lesson that entertains every step of the way.	2001-09-23

Parker returns and this time we find ourselves in a mystery in Maine. We find out more of Charlie &quot;Bird&quot; Parker's past, and get a deeper look into his head. And as if Parker isn't enough reason to read it, Angel and Louis are back as well. ( I would love to see a book with them in the lead!)<br />Connolly's books are dark, and have a bit of supernatural feel to them, but they are engrossing, well written and well researched.<br />Turn on the lights, and be ready to stay up all night!	2001-09-23
US	50318950	RMNBSZB0ZPHQM	0684857146	705687442	Every Dead Thing	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Start Of A Great Series!	I bought this book on sight becuase of the cover. After the first chapter, I was up the rest of the night finishing it. And the images from the book stayed with me. It's dark and and creepy at times, but is off set with some humor. The twists kept me guessing and I really learned to love Parker and his cohorts. Angel and Lewis are wonderful sidekicks.<br />And the way he writes about the USA I never would have guessed that he's from Ireland.<br />I've read the first three in this series, and will buy the rest as soon as they come out. I highly recomend this author's work.	2001-09-23
