THAT'S thoughtful, detailed planning. <br /> <br />the projects that are included are wonderful, as you would expect from marsha  mccloskey. even the color choices for the blocks are inspiring. <br /> <br />this is not a book for an absolute beginner, although there are very good sections about cutting and sewing.  it does not include detailed instructions for construcing a quilt, though, again, what is included is first rate.  however, for anyone who has made even a couple of pieced blocks, this is a bonanza.  <br /> <br />definitely belongs in any quilter's library.	2005-09-23

(and does this woman have any idea of the conditions in ireland in the 1500's?)  also, the continual references to christianity, probably thanks to her source, were off-putting, as well as inaccurate.   <br /> <br />okay, i'll stop the historical criticism, and get to the bits beadworkers want to hear about.  no, one more comment--crochet did not generate income during the famine in ireland, since england didn't allow ireland a cash economy until later in the century.  irish style crochet was a LATE 19th century development. i really will stop now, there are far to many other inaccuracies to tackle individually. <br /> <br />another reviewer has mentioned the really poor directions.  oneexample not mentioned specifically, tubular bead crochet, is not explained sufficiently in the opening chapters--in fact, not until the SECOND project is there any explanation of the massively important technique for keeping the bead on the outside of the tube.  if anyone gets past the first tubular project, it will be only with incredible luck.  this is inexcusable, as 'beadwork' magazine has published better directions for tubular crochet in more than one issue. i know this, since i used these articles to teach myself beaded tubular crochet. <br /> <br />i objected to the inclusion of so many other techniques.  the directions for peyote, etc., are fine if you already know what you're doing, but less than sketchy for new beaders.  but, since this is supposed to be a book about bead crochet, why are other techniques incorporated?  <br /> <br />i, too, think the author's designs are unattractive.  in fact, i think most of them are revolting. <br /> <br />the best part of the book is the pictures of antique bead crochet items.  now, these are inspiring! these are beautiful. these are varied.  they are the only reason i will keep this book in my library.	2004-10-09

(note to author:  hand made doesn't necessarily mean badly made, and is mrs. barnaby so dim-witted and tasteless she'd palm off a bit of tat on her husband?) <br /> <br />what ruined this series for me is the character of troy.  perhaps for people fortunate not to have spent far too much time dealing with the arrogant ignorant, troy's character is an amusing contrast to barnaby.  i, however, am fed to the back teeth with the stupid prejudices of the uneducated, uncultured and limited. and i can't say i have a lot of time for those who think such people are merely comic relief in life as well as literature. <br /> <br />aside from that, as a mystery, this is well plotted and well written.  it is certainly worth trying. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-10-02

(even _poodle springs_ became a spenser novel.)  however, i felt that this had serious flaws. <br /> <br />a sub-plot concerning the young woman's adolescence is never resolved, since a one sentance comment by the psychologist is hardly plot resolution.  this is bad writing. <br /> <br />parker states in this book that sunny's inability to live with anyone is a sign of emotional damage.  for spenser and susan silverman, not living together is a demonstration of autonomy.  so why is sunny damaged when spenser isn't? of course, susan silverman's motivations indulge spenser's preferences, while sunny's ex-husband marries a woman he doesn't love as much as sunny because he has to have a traditional wife.  is this, ever so remotely, possibly a double standard? <br /> <br />the attitude i found most appalling is parker's apparent belief that because two people love each other, it is perfectly permissable to destroy their children.  sunny's father stays with sunny's mother because he loves her.  this is fine.  but, knowing what sort of person she is, did he ever think that maybe she isn't suited to be a mother and take steps to make sure he doesn't father children who will only be hurt?  of course not. he's moderately sorry that his eldest daughter's life is a disaster because of the effects of her mother's upbringing, but that's just fine, since sunny, while equally damaged, can take steps to deal with that damage. <br /> <br />ethical it ain't.  most of parker's work seems to deal with the results of parental irresponsibility, neglect and abuse, and the good and bad results of marital or romantic love.  perhaps in this novel he was stating that whether or not parents keep their children, there is no hope for producing a healthy human being.  if that is so, it's an inexcusably dark and inaccurate view of of all families, and if sunny's family is supposed to be a good example, parker needs to get out more and meet the results of successful, healthy parenting.  they are out there. <br /> <br />the plot is pretty much parker standard. well thought out, plausible, except for the fact that the death of one character has absolutely no effect on the woman who slept with him.  the writing is up to parker's usual standard and is what made it possible for me to finish the book.  but i won't be reading any more sunny randalls. <br /> <br />	2004-09-29

(second question:  is the author really a woman?)<br />if i hadn't first read the author's third book,'house of women,'in which the female characters are varied, flawed but frequently admirable, i might not have been able to enjoy this book as much as i did.  in 'simeon's bride,' the female characters are, with only one exception, horrid.  with the exception of the victim, some of whose motivations are not explained, they are not unrealistic, they are well drawn, but they are definitely not women i would want to know.  and the author almost seems to present them as the normal run of women.  i will say that there is one male character who excels the women in sheer disgusting, contemptible nastiness, so there is some balance between the genders.<br />nevertheless, this is a book i would recommend.  the author writes well, with some wonderful turns of phrase and descriptive passages.  the dialogue is enjoyable, too. the plot is as twisty as any mystery reader could want. the secondary characters are well done.  atmosphere is well conveyed.  for a first novel, it is amazingly good.	2002-02-02

BUT:  this character is an insult to working women, college graduates, single parents and possibly the entire human race.  we are supposed to believe that a person who has finished three years of pre-law and a year of law school doesn't know how to research (well, maybe the south is different, but on the west coast and here in new york state, all i have to do is pick up a phone, call the library, and talk to an eager and willing librarian, and i have all the information i could want, sometimes even faxed or mailed to me); thinks 'vin' is french for vinegar (please--i know academic standards have fallen precipitiously since i was a student, but this is moronic); and hasn't bothered talking to her college about financial aid. (i knew a woman whose husband deserted her and their daughter, leaving them destitute, who went on welfare, and to college, ended up with a doctorate, paid off her student loans and was, the last time i heard, working for a delegation attached to the united nations.  obviously, not the inspiration for this character.  and i am sure that anyone who might read this review knows other women who have managed single parenthood with courage, competance and resourcefulness.)  then, we are supposed to find funny a woman who rearranges furniture in the presence of the freshly-dead corpse of an acquantance--and not from shock, but because the room needs redecorating.  i forgot to mention, i don't find pathological self-involvement funny, either. and, as a horrible addition, we have a child under ten serving as her mother's prop and sounding like an over-mature eighteen-year-old.  <br />the only reason i didn't give this book one star is that the plot more or less holds together.  two apparently separate crimes are linked fairly reasonably.  <br />i have no intention of reading any other book in this series.	2002-01-13

(sample fascinating fact: poundicherry was a french colony for three centuries, and the cuisine reflects this.) there are stories of indian rajahs and the english raj. if fact, it might be difficult to keep your attention on the recipes while cooking, there is so much else that is interesting in this book. the line drawings are another plus. all in all, this is a superb book--tempting, wide-ranging recipes, entertaining reading and beatiful illustrations.	2001-12-21
