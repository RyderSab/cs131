He is as honest a writer <BR>as America has seen since the great days when the beats<BR>held court, taunting late 1950's sensibilities. It's not<BR>pretty, but neither was the life that Bukowski choose to live.<BR>Pick up this book and read it, then pass it on to a friend.	2002-02-20

I think that every good aware American citizen should<br />read this book every five years or so. Our freedom is what<br />makes this country so great. The freedom to be different.<br />The freedom to dream and love according to your own<br />desires. Go into Orwell's world of supression and<br />live out the danger with those who dare to rebel. I<br />read this book to remind myself that the freedom we all<br />love and flourish in, can be restrained in the name of<br />the &quot;state's interest.&quot; Reread this book.

Far too<BR>often the beats are viewed as a bunch of intellectual<BR>hedonists whose love for verse was equalled only<BR>by their indulgence in the various permetations of<BR>chemical abuse. The beats set the stage for the 60's,<BR>and America's search for a true a national spirituality.<BR>As &quot;King of the Beats&quot;, Kerouac takes the reader into an<BR>in depth analysis of what lay at the very heart of the <br />beat movement-the journey is the reward in and of itself.	2002-02-03

It is as if these<br />experiences cleanse away the pores through which his soul<br />breathes. For those of you who may only of read &quot;On the Road&quot;,<br />this book will awaken you to the depths of this great writer's<br />being.

This book is a fitting curtain call to an illustrious career. Steinbeck had a deep love for the common man, for the misfits and socially shackled, and spent a lifetime spinning tales about their trials and tribulations. Yet, he remained so humble despite all the struggles he had endeared to become an &quot;accomplished&quot; writer. The language in this book is a joy to read and I would strongly encourage any young writers to give it a read.	2002-01-24

America has long had<BR>an affinity for the exploits of those who live<BR>on it's fringes. The drifters, the con men, the<BR>dreamers and searchers doomed to anonymity were <BR>it not for the likes of authors such as Steinbeck.<BR>This is a simple tale, but told so well it can be<BR>read again and again...	2002-01-24

The author certainly provided a lot<BR>of background info and did a compelling job of<BR>helping me get a better understanding of the social<BR>climate which Kerouac &amp; friends had to contend with<BR>and conquer. My only complaint is that her writing style<BR>sometimes lapses into a style a little too closely allied<BR>with that of her subject, but given the subject matter, that is<br />understandable.

It was a Monday morning<BR>and I had picked up a newspaper; bound and determined<BR>to scour the want ads until I found prospects for an<BR>honest job, with the full intention of becoming more<BR>respectful. I went to a cafe in North Beach and had a <BR>seat at one of the outdoor tables. As I began to unfold<BR>the newspaper, I noticed that someone had left a copy <BR>of &quot;Desolation Angels&quot; on the chair. I picked it up and <BR>started to read it. Several hours later I abandoned my<BR>faint tries at redemption and walked over to Washington<BR>Square to work on some poetry.

As <BR>excellently chronicled by a young Tom Wolfe,<BR>the beats of the 50's planted the seeds of what <BR>was to become the psychedelic movement. The<BR>thing I like about the beats was that they were <BR>a bunch of intelligentia who made no bones about<BR>the fact that they totally rejected the Eisenhower<BR>50's mentality which held America under siege.<BR>Wolfe does a fine job of emphasizing the theatrics<BR>of the Merry Pranksters. These were more than<BR>a bunch of druged out drifters, these were people<BR>on a mission to spread awareness: to help awaken America <BR>from it's post war slumber. &quot;Go with the flow&quot;: now <BR>there's a motto to live by!	2002-01-16
