It details the history of sites around London where various musical events, composers, performers, even music publishers have flourished. There are chapters on theaters, concert halls and watering places, on choral music and organs, on conservatories, museums, libraries, musical paintings, on graves and memorials to musicians, on the BBC, on orchestras, and on recording locations (including Abbey Road, which of course has had a distinguished history aside from that famous Beatles recording). There is a long section on composers and musicians in London, including really quite detailed information about where various musicians lived, going all the way back to Purcell and beyond.<br /><br />There is a delightful section called 'Five Musical Walks' which are doable rambles that take in such things as where Berlioz and Wagner stayed while in London, the Wigmore Hall, Harold Moores's music shop, and a great deal  more. And a section on musical selections that evoke London and environs.<br /><br />The authors do not claim this to be a scholarly work, but indeed the number of facts (they must have done assiduous research!) is astounding. Did you know that Sir Adrian Boult left his body to scientific research? Or that the celebrated contralto Dame Clara Butt was six foot two? Or that W. S. Gilbert (of Gilbert and Sullivan fame) died of a heart attack while trying to save a drowning young girl? There is a chatty tone and the authors even dish some dirt (see the section on Constant Lambert, or the anecdote about John Ireland's companion, Norah Kirby, attending an Ireland concert wearing gumboots and a pair of John's trousers).<br /><br />There are many pictures - of musicians, of concerts, of musician's homes, et al. - that are printed in the side-columns of the extra-wide glossy pages. My only complaint about the book, in fact, is that it is rather unwieldy because of the wide pages. There are maps  that are very helpful for non-Londoners, a bibliography, instructions about how to reach certain sites whether using public transport, driving or walking, and even web addresses of interest.<br /><br />This is the sort of book one could read front to back or more likely to dip into as interest dictates. Either way, it's a marvelous addition to a musiclover's library.<br /><br />Scott Morrisont wearing gumboots and a pair of John's trousers).<br /><br />There are many pictures - of musicians, of concerts, of musician's homes, et al. - that are printed in the side-columns of the extra-wide glossy pages.

I bought it when it first came out in the late 1960s, later had it in paperback, and now it's been reprinted again. Fred Fitch has to be one of the funniest protagonists in a mystery novel ever. OK, he's drawn a bit unrealistically -- I mean, has anyone ever been as dumb and yet articulate as he? I doubt it. But the notion of his being the easiest mark ever (hence the title) is a hilarious set-up for a book, and Westlake makes you chortle (well, I chortle, but perhaps you guffaw or snort) on practically every page.<br /><br />A definite recommendation, particularly for those Westlake fans who may have missed this one the first time around.<br /><br />Scott Morrison	2005-10-01

But that's not it's real purpose, of course, since it is after all a murder mystery. Baroness Jack Troutbeck, newly elevated to that title, is now in the Lords and consequently her sidekick Robert Amiss gets to investigate a murder there. One is generally less interested in the mystery in a Ruth Dudley Edwards book than enjoying the comic twists in the plot line and laughing at the even quirkier characters, and both abound in this tale.<br /><br />Like the previous reviewer, I believe the ending is rather contrived and it does break one of the cardinal rules of mysterydom, which is that there should be enough clues along the way to give away the identity of the murderer to a careful reader. But since this is a comic mystery that is a bit less of a crime, if you'll pardon the pun.<br /><br />I did not enjoy this one as much as some other Dudley Edwards mysteries, but it did keep me entertained and surely that counts for a lot. One point: someone needs to tell the writer that the state of Virginia is not in the American midwest.	2005-09-05

It is, rather, a detailed exploration of Harold Prince's process, his methods, from his beginnings in the 1950s with 'The Pajama Game,' on through his string of musicals with Stephen Sondheim. the two revivals of Bernstein's 'Candide,' his work with Andrew Lloyd Webber and, in this newly expanded version of a book originally published in 1989, the latest work by Prince, another Sondheim musical, 'Bounce,' the story of the Mizner brothers who were responsible for the real estate boom in Florida.<br /><br />What makes this such an interesting read is that Prince is amazingly candid about his work, and this includes telling us what he believes went wrong with various of his less-successful ventures, and how even the successes might have been made better. We get inside his mind and come to admire his utter honesty and his immense creativity. Author Foster Hirsch, a professor who is an expert on American musical theater, writes in a neatly crafted style which makes the book un-put-downable.<br /><br />This is a must-read for anyone who is interested in the Broadway musical, particularly of the last fifty years.<br /><br />Scott Morrison	2005-08-27

He takes us through five hundred years of Western cultural history, lards the book with the most esoteric and complex information, and yet somehow manages to make this book a breathless \\"page-turner.\\" His sure-footed erudition grounds him so securely that he can make forays into the outr&eacute;, the weird, the seemingly trivial, and then come back to relate it to a baseline of solid historical narrative. One sees connections never noticed, or even imagined, before. One learns of important figures who somehow have avoided the glare of modern scrutiny. I had the feeling I was in the presence of the best college professor I could ever hope to have, and was never intimidated; I just didn't want to miss the next class. [Maybe that's because I knew there was no final exam!]<br /><br />One appreciates Barzun's decidedly conservative notion that old values matter. He gives political correctness a clop in the chops. He defends some currently dismissed figures like Columbus. And even though he is not terribly sanguine about current cultural trends, he is basically optimistic about the future.<br /><br />Oh, to have Professor Barzun and me sitting on the two ends of a log, talking, talking. Wait: that's what we have here. Lucky me. Lucky us.	2005-08-22

A novella is, as defined in the publishing world, a story that is longer than a short story (which usually runs up to 5,000 words) and shorter than a novel (usually more than 60,000 words), somewhere in the neighborhood of 10,000 to 40,000 words. And apparently a novella (sometimes called a novelette) is hard to write because it tends either to compress to a short story or expand to a novel. Yet, the ten writers here, none of the neophytes, met their charge from McBain to come up with a genuine novella with aplomb (except perhaps for Stephen King, whose novella really reads like a short story - but then he's a big enough name that it's no surprise that his story made the book without any criticism). As in any collection there are some hits and some misses, but in fact I was engaged by every single entry. Some, though, were a cut above the rest -- Walter Mosley's 'Archibald  Lawless, Anarchist at Large: Walking the Line' and Lawrence Block's 'Keller's Adjustment.' (I will admit that I tend to read everything these two writers produce and they are particular favorites of mine. Mosley, in fact, I consider to be one of our best writers, regardless of genre.)<br /><br />As is usual for me, I could not get as involved in the story by Joyce Carol Oates, but I suspect that is some peculiar allergy of mine; I've rarely thoroughly enjoyed anything of hers, even though I can admire her skills and obviously plenty of others admire her more than I. Ed McBain's contribution takes place in his familiar Eighty-Seventh Precinct.<br /><br />One theme that recurs in the stories is the changes in the post-9/11 world. Indeed, in stories like 'Merely Hate' by McBain and 'The Things They Left Behind' by King that is central to the plot. (By the way, the King story causes his usual and still spookily enjoyable frisson with its eerie atmosphere.)<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this collection to anyone who likes shorter fiction but wants something more substantial than the usual mystery/suspense short story.<br /><br />Scott Morrisonle frisson with its eerie atmosphere.)<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this collection to anyone who likes shorter fiction but wants something more substantial than the usual mystery/suspense short story.<br /><br />Scott Morrison	2005-08-07

It's all good humored - well, mostly - in the manner of 'Seinfeld.' (One of Winokur's heroes is Larry David, the writer of the first several seasons of that hit show.) He skewers the pretensions and group-think of our times with a light heart, but all with a barely suppressed growl. Irony and sarcasm abound, but also empathy (oh, he'd hate my using that word!) for those of us who are trying to make our way in this vale of tears.<br /><br />This is the sort of book that you want to keep at your bedside for dipping into for a few minutes now and again.

However, there are -- and none of the other reviewers have mentioned this -- some up-to-the-minute sly comments about the US's current political climate. One of the characters is a clone of cable news's Tucker Carlson, complete with bow tie and smugness. He and his jaunty grandmother, Ada Geiger, 94, a newly rediscovered noir film director, get into some hilariously pointed arguments about the state of politics in America and the world.

Bernard Cohen, the founder of the Harvard Department of the History of Science. One has the sense that had he had more time to work on it it might have been better organized and more tightly focused. Although there are many fascinating facts and anecdotes in this short outline of the effects of numbers on modern life and the development of their use over the centuries, there are many divagations that don't add much to the story. When he takes time to correct the French in someone's book title, one wonders why he wastes space on that when he doesn't make it clear why he was citing the book in the first place. Still we meet such well-known characters as Kepler and Galileo, Jefferson and Franklin, and lesser known but fascinating thinkers like Andr&eacute; Michel Guerry and Adolphe Quetelet who advanced the science of statistics and applied it to such sociological concerns as crime and punishment. We meet statistical Luddites like Dickens, who thought the collection of demographic data would be used against the average man. We finish with a weak chapter about Florence Nightingale's use of statistics in the medical realm. We do not venture on into the twentieth century.<br /><br />This is a variably interesting but ultimately not very useful essay, I'm afraid. It is notable for its quirkily amusing  anecdotes, but rather falls down when it attempts to convey the important uses to which numbers are put in modern life.<br /><br />Scott Morrison	2005-06-11

We have the Queer Studies, gender-concerned, politically correct, Derridean deconstructionist and self-invented stereotypes which might become burdensome if not for the poisonously witty pen of Dudley Wright whose lampooning is both deft and good-humored. Lady Jack Troutbeck, who insists on being called 'Madam Chairwoman' to the gasps of some of her committee members, is a real creation, one I'd love to meet in real life, although I might find myself cringing if she were to decide to puncture my own personal balloon of pretentiousness.<br /><br />Anyone who has ever sat on an academic or prize committee will find much that is deplorably recognizable here.

The characters are just screwy enough that they keep you off balance with their oddities, their turns of phrase, their impulsive comments and, even more, their impulsive behavior, mostly done in good humor and definitely done with funny outcome. Others before me have written synopses of the plot and I won't get into that. But I will say that the father of the Laments (an engineer who is 'in valves') provides the engine for the saga by repeatedly moving the family from one corner of the world to another. In a sense this is like a funny travel book, except the Laments always live 'on the economy' and are able to interact with the locals' idiosyncrasies in their own appealing way.<br /><br />I enjoyed 'The Laments' thoroughly. I'm just afraid that my wife, who is now reading the book, will be disappointed that she has already had some of the good bits read out loud to her.

I did remember that he had written a memoir of his peripatetic childhood that was praised probably fifteen years ago. I was unprepared for the power and grace of this collection of short stories published in 1996. A little research on the Internet tells me that Wolff is primarily a short story writer -- he has certainly found his niche in that, although I gather he has recently written a novel -- and is a professor at Stanford. But, most of all, he is a born story-teller. This is not to say that one is not also aware of the lapidary quality of his writing. My point is that even absent his  writing skill he would still be someone you'd want to engage in conversation, or rather someone you'd like to sit and listen to as he spins yarns about the mundane. The mundane is his subject, but like all good writers, he puts it in such a perspective as to make it new and insightful.<br /><br />Others before me, here at Amazon, have written about certain of the short stories here. The stories' subject matter is, generally, that of youth and young adulthood, and most importantly, about observation. His protagonists seem to have a preternatural writer's eye, which is part of what I look for in fiction. That's one of the great things about a great writer -- that ability to see things in ways most of us don't.<br /><br />My favorite story? Probably 'Firelight,' about a boy and his hapless but courageous mother who go to look at apartments. Simple plot, but with deep implications about belonging, what home and family is, and about hope. The coda of this story, with the little boy all grown up and with a family of his own, tells us, as so often in Wolff's stories, how childhood experience colors our adult lives. Beautiful. I suppose now I'll have to go and read everything Wolff has written. Nice to contemplate.<br /><br />Scott Morrison	2005-05-30

What surprised me was the heavy interlarding of both biography and exegesis of the pessimistic and misanthropic Schopenhauer, surely one of the least understood and oft-lampooned philosophers -- I'm reminded of that line from one of Ira Gershwin's lyrics: \\"My evenings were sour/Spent with Schopenhauer\\" -- whose writings are quoted, in translation, extensively to make certain points. As one of the group's participants says late in the book, the quotations are highly selected to make a certain kind of point, and many of  Schopenhauer's other writings that contradict those quotations are conveniently passed over. Still, it's a daring literary conceit and one that Yalom very nearly pulled off. One certainly admires his daring is attempting it.<br /><br />As a novel, one comes to care for the characters -- with some exceptions -- and the story carries one along. Unfortunately, the last fifty pages or so feel arbitrary, casually tossed off, and thus disappointing. One senses that Yalom cares for his characters, toward the end, as little as Schopenhauer cared for 'human bipeds,' to use his term.<br /><br />I am glad to have read this novel. Yalom is an interesting writer. I do wish it had been better edited, though. His tendency to write awkwardly and, frankly, to misuse words (e.g. 'flaunt' for 'flout') would have been caught by an alert editor.<br /><br />Scott Morrison	2005-05-23

I've admired his writings for many years and had heard about this book from several friends who recommended it highly. I now see why. Not only does Simmons have a particularly graceful writing style, he is able to explain with clarity some complicated matters, describing music in non-technical language that most reasonably educated readers would be able to understand. His contention that these six composers have been generally under-appreciated and misunderstood is argued cogently and convincingly, and he shares insights not seen anywhere else. There is a section on each of the six composers - Bloch, Hanson, Giannini, Creston, Barber,  and Flagello (I was particularly heartened by the inclusion of the shamefully neglected Giannini and Flagello) -- that contains a brief biography and then a fairly detailed description of his major (and many smaller) works in the order they were composed. Recommendations are made for recordings for those wishing to explore the music itself.<br /><br />I for one am eager to read each of the five prospective books to follow this one. The subjects of the remaining books will cover American neo-classicists, American opera composers, American nationalists and populists, three traditionalists of the Juilliard School, and American traditionalists of the post-1930 generation. When this series is finished it will, on the evidence of this first volume, comprise one of the very most valuable overall studies of American classical music in print.<br /><br />Strongly recommended.<br /><br />Scott Morrison	2005-04-25

Here at Amazon I am primarily a reviewer of classical music CDs and DVDs, but I occasionally review books that have a musical background (and I recently highly recommended a first novel, 'The Student Conductor' by Robert Ford). Of course the present novel was inspired by both Tolstoy's novella and by Jan&aacute;cek's string quartet subtitled 'The Kreutzer Sonata,' which had been prompted  by Jan&aacute;cek's own tortured love for a much younger woman. Margriet de Moor, however able a writer she is, takes these two classics and writes a meta-novel that is not nearly as effective as either the Tolstoy or the Jan&aacute;cek. Indeed, it almost feels as if what she has done is simply rip off the better-known works.<br /><br />The surprise at the end of de Moor's novel is neither satisfying nor psychologically particularly convincing. I am giving the book three stars only because of the elegant prose, and some of the credit for that surely goes to the translator from the original Dutch, Susan Massotty.<br /><br />Scott Morrison	2005-04-05

And I wasn't expecting much here. But indeed Anthony Tommasini, the principal music critic of the New York Times, has not written that sort of book at all. He assumes that most readers will have some notion of what each opera is about and he writes of them from that perspective, focusing more on musical and dramatic aspects of the opera. He recommends his favorite CD recordings of the operas - and makes a comment that DVDs are new enough that there aren't DVDs of some of the operas he is writing about - and makes a case for each of them. He starts by giving some explanatory notes about such things as voice types, bel canto and recitative, and includes a little essay about why he chose the operas to include in his 'top 100.' He clearly is interested in proselytizing for some lesser-known and some modern operas (e.g., Copland's 'Tender Land,' Prokofiev's 'Betrothal in a Monastery,' Messiaen's 'Saint François d'Assise') that he feels have been ignored to some degree. Some choices are both surprising and exciting, such as Sondheim's 'Sweeney Todd.' He includes little-known facts that were new even to a grizzled opera-lover like this reviewer. And best of all he writes in a elegant and unfailingly interesting style. I found myself having trouble putting the book down. I tended to like the book at least partly because his enthusiasms mirror mine, but in those areas where we disagree he argued his points cogently. For instance, I am willing, after reading his essay about John Adams's 'Nixon in China,' to investigate it further.<br /><br />Tommasini writes for both the relative newcomer to opera and the operatic veteran. There is a dearth of technical terms, but when one is used it is gracefully and uncondescendingly defined. This is a book for the reader whose interest in opera is anything more than cursory.<br /><br />Scott Morrison	2005-04-02

Frankly, I've never read anything like it. It's told from inside the head of a man whose Vietnam War head injury leaves him unable to speak. But his internal monolog is so rich, observant, feelingful that the pain of his not being able to express himself except through his actions becomes a paean to the virtues of patience over adversity, expression of love through loving actions rather than words, and the wisdom of living life as it is, not as it might have been. King's prose is carefully and poetically chosen. His observations of the little things feel true and important. I am ready to predict from this first novel that this is an important writer just revving up for a huge career.<br /><br />Scott Morrison	2005-03-23

He takes a casual but observant stroll through Balanchine's professional and personal lives and with telling incident and anecdote makes this giant of twentieth-century art come alive, warts and all. Further, his tone is one of kindliness and understanding, even when it comes to Balanchine's inveterate womanizing, without it becoming a work  of hagiography. And he conveys in words how Balanchine filled his plotless ballets with \\"the most extraordinary encounters and events\\" and changed the face of modern ballet.<br /><br />I came to this book not as a balletomane but as a lover of the music of Stravinsky whose music, of course, was the aural life blood of Balanchine's art. I was not disappointed in that there were many glimpses of Stravinsky along the way. But more important Teachout's easy style and consummate story-telling ability made this a compulsive read. Many biographers lack that quality.<br /><br />Frankly I would recommend this book not only to the dance neophyte like me, but to any lover of ballet, or modern dance, or of twentieth century music. It certainly provides a beautifully written record of one of the high points of American culture of its era.<br /><br />Scott Morrison	2005-03-05

This carries over to the Good CD Guide. I don't have the newest one--the 2005 edition--and most likely won't buy it largely because I have this recent one, and more important, because although the opinions in the book are often well-reasoned, they tend to be, how shall I say, old-fogeyish. I'm a great believer in preserving and treasuring historic recordings, but surely good recordings (excepting British ones, of course) didn't dry up in, say, 1980.<br /><br />I agree with a previous reviewer who indicated that the Penguin Guide (which is also British) is more helpful. It's easier to navigate, too.	2005-02-01

I'd suggest you avoid that one for reasons outlined below. In fact, this review is appearing with BOTH the current and the old edition. Look above and make sure you are looking at info about the 3RD EDITION published in 2004, not earlier. If it is not, look for it. Some of the negative reviews included here for the THIRD edition were actually written about the earlier, inferior edition.]<br /><br />Earlier reviewers have complained that what must have been an earlier edition was falling apart after some months use. I have a 2004 edition (the 3rd edition) and am not experiencing that problem at all. I wonder if Harper Collins got complaints and changed the paper and binding used. Whether or not that is the case, I can attest that my copy, used a fair amount, is standing up well.<br /><br />The dictionary itself is reasonably complete for a 'concise' volume. It contains 877 pages of dictionary proper, and then at the back there is another section of 255 pages that goes into some detail on issues of grammar - always an concern with non-French speakers/readers - and usage.<br /><br />In the main body of the dictionary there are occasional sidebars that explain some otherwise confusing words. An example picked at random: \\"'Beur' is a term used to refer to a person born in France of North African immigrant parents. It is not racist and is often used by the media, anti-racist groups and second-generation North Africans themselves. It comes from back-slang, or 'verlan.'\\" [A separate note explains what 'verlan' is, but I won't go into that here.]<br /><br />I'm reasonably fluent in French and find that those words and phrases I DO know are well-translated here. But there are plenty of words and phrases included that were new to me, always a good thing to discover. Also, the pronunciation guide is fairly good at finding English equivalents for French sounds.<br /><br />I can recommend this edition wholeheartedly.<br /><br />Scott Morrisonion wholeheartedly.<br /><br />Scott Morrison	2005-02-01

Physically the book (and its companion comprising the rest of the sonatas) is well done. It lies flat, the binding doesn't crack (or at least mine hasn't in several years' usage), the printing is legible, the fingerings are easy to read and generally pretty apt. This book and its companion have had a lot of use and they're still in pretty good shape. And, of course, they provide many hours of pleasure at the piano.<br /><br />Perhaps best of all is that Dover's price won't break anyone's bank.

I loved Vikram Seth's 'An Equal Music,' for instance, with its main characters who are chamber music players. But I have to say that as much as I admired Seth's book, this one is better. It is not only startlingly apt in its insider's understanding of the world of classical musicians, but also for its complex, thought-provoking plot with its many subtly revealed secrets, and for its burnished language. Author Robert Ford was a flutist and received an MFA from Yale before becoming a writer and actor. He clearly knows from the inside about the insecurities, obsessiveness and search for transcendence so often seen in top-level musicians. He describes those qualities with spare lyricism and telling detail. (Here, for instance, is a passage about the protagonist, a violinist-turned-student-conductor now studying in Germany with a great if mysterious maestro.  He has not played his violin in months but picks it up again for a day-long practice session: \\"Three months without playing had left his chin smooth and vulnerable. He'd been so intent on tuning intervals, one small correction after another, that he'd forgotten the need to work in a callus. He brushed a knuckle just behind the jaw bone and winced. When he looked, there was a mosquito's worth of blood on the back of his finger.\\")<br /><br />The music of Brahms figures as a leitmotiv throughout this book and it is described in detail that only a musician - and a good writer - could provide. While reading 'The Student Conductor' I kept open my own score of Brahms's Second Symphony for frequent reference, and was astonished to realize how many insights Ford gave me about the work--not something you'd expect a novel to do, is it? I also found myself referring to a couple of books that I am sure Ford used in his preparation for writing the book: Jan Swafford's marvelous biography of Brahms, and Norman Lebrecht's gossipy 'The Maestro Myth.'<br /><br />However the main theme of the book is not the music. It is a love story, of sorts, that takes place against the background of Germany in 1989 when the Wall fell. Not only are there ghosts from the divided Germany--primarily in the character of East German oboist Petra Vogel with whom student conductor Cooper Barrow falls in love--but from the era  of Hitler's Germany whose shadow falls on Barrow's conducting teacher, Karlheinz Ziegler. Plot twists bearing on these things make the book compulsively readable.<br /><br />I would recommend this book urgently to readers who have some background in music. But I would also recommend it as well to those who have no such background because Ford has an ability to describe the inner lives of classical musicians in a way that makes it understandable to anyone. Plus, it's a great story.<br /><br />Scott MorrisonMyth.'<br /><br />However the main theme of the book is not the music.

The characters are, by and large, gentle and literate. The tone is comic and lyrical. The plot is quirky without being off-putting. And best of all for us word-puzzlers--crosswords, puns, anagrams, palindromes, the lot--it's chock full of delightful gems. For instance, not only the book's title but all the chapter titles, too, are themselves palindromes (e.g. 'Pa's a saP') and actually have bearing on the chapter content; Marcus's father really IS a sap. The main character herself, Emily Lime, has a palindromic name. Even her dog, Otto, has one. (Another plus is that most of the characters are animal lovers.)<br /><br />This is not Great Literature, but it is a Fun Read.<br /><br />Scott Morrison	2005-01-29

I have not seen a hardback edition.]<br /><br />I happened upon this Dictionary of Music, picked it up, found it interesting and decided to read it--or at least large parts of it--because the Facts on File series is an important one and in my experience pretty reliable. Christine Ammer, a lexicographer who has written several references books bearing on music, has been editor of the Harvard Dictionary of Music, a pretty definitive reference book, and I assumed she would write a good reference book here; also, as this is the 4th Edition, I figured errors would have been weeded out. But frankly it was fairly easy to find some small errors of fact, spelling, editing etc. For instance, she says Barber's 'Knoxville: Summer of 1915' is a song cycle; it isn't. She consistently misspelled Harrison Birtwistle's name (she spells it, as so many do, 'Birtwhistle'). She says 'malague&ntilde;a' is pronounced 'm&auml; l&auml; gwe'nya'. Nope, that -gu- is pronounced simply as a hard -g-, not a -gw-. And so on. But she also has an ability to come up with apt descriptions, as when she describes 'bariolage,' that violin technique of alternating a tone between a stopped string and an open string, as having an effect similar to that of a jazz trumpeter's wah-wah mute. I really smiled at that one.<br /><br />The dictionary covers a broad area and includes fairly long articles on some subjects (examples: organ, double bass, Prokofiev, fugue) and many obscure terms (examples: mancando, inciso, Child ballad, sequencer) in all fields of music, classic, folk and popular. The language used in definitions is easily understood and where there is any doubt about the meaning of a word used in a definition or article, it is briefly defined. There is an appended list of musical instruments and composers, and there are many easy-to-interpret line-drawing illustrations.<br /><br />This is a dictionary that would be handy for readers who are not terribly knowledgable about music, but who do know something about the basics. The ability to read simple musical notation is probably necessary.<br /><br />All said, the minor errors are not fatal to the usefulness of this book. Still, there are probably better and more complete musical dictionaries, including Baker's Dictionary and those from Harvard and Oxford. But they are much more expensive, even in their paperback editions.<br /><br />Scott Morrisonterribly knowledgable about music, but who do know something about the basics.

And the themes they come up with for their puzzles are often the sort that stump you until you finally make a breakthrough and then you chortle in delight (or groan loudly if it involves a pun). But that's OK. I'm at an age that I figure if I can continue to do the toughest Times puzzles I'm holding Alzheimer's at bay.<br /><br />Times puzzles get harder as you progress from Monday through Saturday. In this book are the tough Friday and Saturday puzzles. A lot of people think the Sunday puzzle would be the hardest, but it's not. It's simply larger than the daily puzzles.<br /><br />The pages are about 8.5 X 11 inches. What I tend to do is tear a page out (with a puzzle both front and back) and affix it to a  clipboard so I can do them with a sharp pencil and not have the underlying pages make it too soft for a crisp pencil mark. But one can simply do them in the book.<br /><br />These are definitely the best classic American-style crossword puzzles available.<br /><br />Scott Morrison	2005-01-14

And they also have a title--which helps the solver to figure out what the puzzle's theme might be--and they supply name the constructor of the puzzles, something that doesn't occur with the daily puzzles.<br /><br />Doing the Sunday Times crossword puzzle is a habit with many of the Times's readers, but for those of us who don't live in New York or buy the Sunday Times, this is the next best thing. I know I wouldn't be able to feel like a Sunday was complete until I had done the Sunday puzzle.<br /><br />My method, in case anyone is interested, is to tear each puzzle page out and put it on a clipboard. That way one doesn't have to deal with any awkwardness from trying to do the puzzles while holding a largeish book, although I've done that, too. Also, this allows for your pencil marks to remain crisp whereas if you leave the puzzle in the book the softness of the underlying pages makes your pencil marks a little blurry.<br /><br />Make no mistake, these are wonderful puzzles and the price is very reasonable.<br /><br />Scott Morrison	2005-01-14

Any writer who can imagine a character who hallucinates hearing 'Hey Jude' sung as a duet between Bobby Gentry and Pl&aacute;cido Domingo can't be ignored. This guy Hiaasen is one of the funniest writers around. I'll read anything he writes. This one, though, is one of his best. I couldn't put it down and I laughed so hard my wife thought I might have a stroke. It tells a page-turning story that involves characters that probably couldn't exist in reality, but who cares? The plot is complicated, with parallel threads running throughout, but it makes good sense and, of course, comes out right. Further, he manages to make the reader think about unfunny things like the horrible agricultural pollution of the Everglades--Hiaasen loves his swamps and their denizens, human and otherwise--without it becoming the least bit preachy.<br /><br />Obviously I don't have much to add to the previous 176 reviewers, but I felt I had to add my own enthusiastic endorsement.<br /><br />Scott Morrison	2005-01-10

It is a hilarious and ultimately unsettling story of a Londoner who has made it his life's work to shame and quiet those people who cough during performances at classical music concerts at the Barbican, Festival Hall and the Royal Albert. One initially sympathizes with his irritation but becomes more and more aware that his bête noire has made him just the least little bit unhinged.<br /><br />One can also add a commendation for what is probably the best story here, praised liberally by previous reviewers, 'Knowing French.'

That is that the 'world-famous conductor' who is the murder victim in this story is clearly modeled after Herbert von Karajan. Such things as his being wanted all over the world, his flying in for one performance before jetting off to another part of the world, the questions about his participation in Nazidom during World War II and so on are clearly references to him.<br /><br />Aside from that, however, the plot is neatly done, the descriptions of Venice are evocative, the dolce far niente attitudes of Italian culture (particularly that of the Sicilian chief of the Venetian police department) are all drawn with a wickedly funny flair.<br /><br />Recommended, but particularly for those who love opera.<br /><br />Scott Morrison	2004-11-29

This book contains information about almost 200 operas, most of them popular and frequently mounted, but some of them pretty rare--works like Szymanowski's 'King Roger,' Dallapiccola's 'Il prigioniero,' and Zimmermann's 'Die Soldaten.' The format of each entry is as follows: Composer and his dates, name of the opera, type of opera, approximate length,  cast of characters with their voice type, information about librettist and original plot source, time and place of the action, where and when first performed. This is followed by a few paragraphs about the composer and the origins of the work, often containing interesting tidbits about the how the work got to the stage, who was involved in the premi&egrave;re, early reaction to the opera and so forth. Then there is a fairly detailed (and clearly written) plot summary, followed by Osborne's own description and assessment of the music, the high points of the score, weak points in the score if any and finally a recommendation for a recording. It is of note that he recommends audio (CD) recordings but no DVD or videotape  versions. (I find myself agreeing more often than not with his recommendations in those instances where I have my own opinion.) There is a fairly barebones index at the back of the book.<br /><br />Not every opera gets equal treatment. It seems that Osborne is more taken with Italian bel canto opera than other sorts, but that may be my mistaken view since I'm least interested in that area of the repertoire. He often makes rather pointed (and  humorously accurate) comments as when he refers to Douglas Moore's 'The Ballad of Baby Doe' as 'sub-Britten' or when he says that in 'Adriana Lecouvreur' 'Cilea spreads his melodic gift thinly.' There is a more than occasional waspishness that I frankly rather enjoyed. Sometimes, though, he is strangely vague as when he says, simply, that Barber 'was a friend of the opera composer Gian Carlo Menotti,'--they were long-time lovers--or when he omits telling us of Erika's miscarriage in Act III of 'Vanessa.' There are the usual number of minor solecisms--misspelling of conductor Gianandrea Gavazzeni's last name, repeated misspelling of the name of noted Bohemian writer and librettist of Dvor&aacute;k's 'Rusalka,' Jaromir Kvapil. No glaring substantive errors were noted.<br /><br />I suspect this is a book intended primarily for readers who are relative newcomers to opera. Though I am not a more than moderately informed opera lover, I learned little new--but I was startled, I admit, to learn that 'Tirso de Molina,' the Spanish writer on whose 'El burlador de Sevilla' Mozart's and Da Ponte's 'Don Giovanni' was based, was a nom de plume for a monk named Gabriel Tellez.<br /><br />Osborne has a graceful prose style and his use of humor and his  willingness to state his artistic opinions makes the book a good deal more interesting to read than a simple recitation of the facts about opera.<br /><br />Scott Morrisongh, he is strangely vague as when he says, simply, that Barber 'was a friend of the opera composer Gian Carlo Menotti,'--they were long-time lovers--or when he omits telling us of Erika's miscarriage in Act III of 'Vanessa.'

(And it's WESCHLER, not WECHSLER as I'd misread it for the longest time.) He is one of the better essayists around and has some of the qualities that make that possible: an insatiable curiosity, the drive to pursue a topic to its inmost meaning, a mind that makes connections between seemingly disparate notions, an ability to empathize with people he writes about, a drive to explore almost unimaginably emotionally powerful situations, and a graceful prose style. This book collects twenty or so more-or-less unrelated pieces written over twenty years and on a variety of subjects. He has grouped them, however, into related areas: A Balkan Triptych, Three Polish Survivor Stories, Grandfathers and Daughters, Three L.A. Stories, Three Portraits of Artists, and a postlude, 'A Final Vermeer Convergence.'<br /><br />The title piece, 'Vermeer in Bosnia,' is about the Hague War Crimes tribunal and derives its title from the tribunal judge who day in and day out has to listen and look at evidences of the horrors of the genocidal acts taking place in the former Yugoslavia; he confesses that he restores his peace of mind by going to visit the Vermeers at the nearby Mauritshuis Museum. This theme of the horror of war and racial intolerance (and the human  emotional interconnections in spite of them) runs through the entire book. Roman Polanski's chaotic childhood in WWII Poland. Graphic novelist ('Maus') Art Spiegelman's parents' physical escape from concentration camps but their inability to escape in their minds.

(As primarily a classical music CD reviewer, I have reviewed recordings of music by Toch which is having a resurgence, but had had no idea until I read Weschler's piece about him that he was the composer's grandson. There is a short piece about a since recorded major work of his, a Passover choral work, 'Cantata of the Bitter Herbs,' which is available here at Amazon.)<br /><br />There are also pieces that celebrate the ineffable connection between fathers and their daughters (or grandfathers and granddaughters).  There's a charming piece (from the NPR program 'This American life') about his own daughter's firm belief in the existence of the Borrowers (Mary Norton's children's book characters). I had to chuckle because the Borrowers live at our house, too.

As a retired Kansas City psychiatrist, I was indeed fascinated by both the focus on Kansas City scenes and on the kind of treatment received by mental patients back in the 1920s and 1930s. But more than that I was caught up in the story of four men separated by generations, a 'lunatic' who murdered his family in 1905, a boy who witnessed Kansas City's 1933 Union Station massacre, a young doctor working in a 'lunatic asylum,' and a current-day Kansas City police officer. The story moves seamlessly back and forth between these periods in a way that is not only not confusing but is downright illuminating, managing to tell how the lives of these four men intersected. I admire the way Lehrer drops in historical detail in subtle ways so that we form in our minds a picture of the times. And I particularly liked the way he limned the humanity of all four main characters so that we not only find them interesting, we grow to care about them.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone, not just to those who are interested in midwestern history and the history of one of the most newsworthy events of the 1930s.<br /><br />Scott Morrison	2004-11-19

Such is the case here. Slonimsky, whose 'Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians' and 'Music since 1900' should be on every musiclover's shelves, was a musical polymath who spent most of his career as a musicologist and writer on music. When he died at over 100 years of age in 1995 his manuscripts were given to the Library of Congress where they remain more or less uncatalogued. His daughter, Electra Slonimsky Yourke, with some others, went through boxes and boxes of his things in order to rescue and bring to light some of his occasional writings about composers and their works. She assembled this collection under the title 'The Listener's Companion' and it was published in 2002. She says in her foreword that there were often several essays bearing on the same composer or work because Slonimsky, among other things, wrote program notes for orchestras, liner notes for recordings and so on. Consequently some of the pieces presented here are actually cobbled together from several articles. Hence one of the problems with the book. There are numbers of repetitions, often within the same article. For instance, here are two sentences from the article on Sergei Prokofiev: 'Prokofiev decided to play his own [first] piano concerto for the commencement exercises at the conservatory,' and, three paragraphs later, 'In 1914, he played his First Piano Concerto as a graduation piece at the St. Petersburg Conservatory.' [Slonimsky, a compulsive editor and fact-checker, would be horrified.] This carelessness is mildly irritating but it does not detract too severely from what is otherwise typically interesting Slonimskian prose. I've collected much of what he wrote not only for the information contained but also for the sheer joy of his style. There was, concealed behind his scholarly façade, an imp of equal importance, and that makes reading him a constant delight; one never knows what will pop up and make one chuckle. Another aspect of his style was the use of unusual words--he had a incomparable command of English although it was not his first language. Where else would you, in an otherwise straightforward passage about the second movement of Ravel's G Major Piano Concerto, encounter 'the gemmation of the austere melody and its florification are remarkable'? I don't know about you, but that tickles me; Slonimsky is playing with language the way a kitten plays with a ball of yarn. As Ms Yourke suggests in her foreword, it pays to read Slonimsky with a dictionary at hand.<br /><br />The book is organized by composer, in chronological order thus: Bach - Handel - Haydn - Mozart - Beethoven - Mendelssohn - Wagner - Brahms - Tchaikovsky - Rimsky-Korsakov - Mahler - Debussy - R. Strauss - Schoenberg - Ravel - Bart&oacute;k - Stravinsky - Prokofiev - Shostakovich. There is an introductory essay about each composer and then individual essays about some of their works. As you can see, the book is not all-inclusive and, indeed, under each composer there are major omissions. For instance, Beethoven's 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 6th symphonies do not rate an entry. One reason for this, of course, is the source of the essays--an uncatalogued hodgepodge of writings written for specific occasions. Still, one gets a good sense of the style of each composer, some real insights into the pieces under scrutiny, and lots of gossipy tales about all of them. Slonimsky was nothing if not a good storyteller.<br /><br />So, this is not one of Slonimsky's major works, and it is not even a necessary work, as these things go, but it is at least generally fascinating and revealing, the sort of book to dip into as the need or desire arises. I've spent many enjoyable moments with it and expect that will continue.<br /><br />Scott Morrisonght; one never knows what will pop up and make one chuckle.

You may find it a little too \\"girly,\\" but I think you'll really like it anyhow.' Well, she was certainly right about my liking it. And it wasn't too 'girly,' either; although the main characters are women, the interactions, the plot twists, the quirkiness of all the characters, and the unexpectedness of their inner lives made it all fascinating to me.<br /><br />Stephanie Kallos, a first-time novelist, has a delightful sense of humor and a real facility with words. Although the main arc of the plot winds up being fairly predictable (and, I might add, extremely satisfying), there are enough unexpected incidents and revelations along the way to make this trip very enjoyable. And her characters are all credible people with vivid inner lives, past histories, present desires and hesitations. All are wounded in some way, but none is a victim in the usual sense. And underlying all this is a strong current of the will to survive and even triumph, especially in the context of a purpose-created community of eccentrics.<br /><br />It would be a shame if this book is overlooked because it is by a new novelist whose name doesn't ring a bell. If Kallos keeps writing, her name WILL become much better known.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />Scott Morrison	2004-10-12

He's written mystery novels, featuring Easy Rawlins, and at least one science fiction novel, 'Blue Light.' He's written about one of the most interesting characters in American fiction, Socrates Fortlow, in a group of short stories, 'Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned' and 'Walkin' the Dog.' And now he's written a novel set on Long Island, far from his usual Los Angeles scene, in a community of African-Americans who have been there since before the Revolution (that's the American Revolution, folks!). And he's concocted a wildly improbable plot that if nothing else convinces that Mosley has a wickedly inventive and creative mind.<br /><br />But most of all, and true in all of Mosley's writing, there is an undercurrent of subtly examined moral and ethical issues. Not the kind that clobbers you over the head with preachiness, but the kind that draws you in and makes you start thinking hard about things that are deep and disturbing, issues like 'good' and 'evil.'<br /><br />This novel, which I've now read twice, has stayed with me long after most books are distant memories. There is something profoundly disturbing and yet profoundly moving in this short book. So, in spite of there already being 30+ reviews of 'The Man in My Basement,' I felt I had to add my endorsement.<br /><br />Urgently recommended.<br /><br />Scott Morrison	2004-10-02

Starting with the early part of the 20th-century and working his way slowly to the present day, John Bush Jones groups musicals according to their themes and intent, calling some simply 'diversionary' (the sort that is so often thought to be aimed at the 'tired businessman') and others 'issue-driven,' (those with a theme which somehow mirrors the society at large). Clearly his interest is primarily with the latter, although he does discuss some of the unconscious thematic issues of the former. He does sometimes tend to get a bit caught up in his own premises and oversell them, but by and large this is a scholarly, and entirely readable, history of an art form that was invented on our shores and brought to its peak here, although it has been imitated prolifically elsewhere. He makes the point that most of the creators were Jewish (as he is) but doesn't offer much of an explanation for why this might be so.  He focuses repeatedly on such things as shows with African-American, Jewish, political, sociological and psychological themes. He offers a fine analysis of the so-called 'concept musical' (e.g., 'Company' or 'Chorus Line') which he prefers to call 'fragmented musicals,' a description which points out their lack of an ordinary linear plot line.<br />One could argue with some of his emphases and analyses, but one has to respect the depth and breadth of his research and knowledge. He analyzes sociopolitical themes at length in such musicals as 'Show Boat,' 'The Cradle Will Rock,' 'Pal Joey,' 'Oklahoma,' 'South Pacific,' 'Carousel,' 'Sweeney Todd,' 'Fiddler on the Roof,' and others. Sometimes he finds hidden meanings that I had a hard time agreeing with, but I can only admire his imaginative look at some musicals that many of us tend to see as primarily 'diversionary.'<br />The book includes appendices listing the most popular or important musicals grouped roughly by decade and the number of performances they achieved. And there is also an extensive bibliography. I've read many books about the musical theatre and this one is unique in its perspective; it brings an interesting slant to the subject. Thus, it is a worthy addition to the long list of important books about the art form.<br />Scott Morrisonisting the most popular or important musicals grouped roughly by decade and the number of performances they achieved.

I'm in the midst of one of these periods as I write this review. I came across this 1995 book at my local library and have been utterly delighted by it. Otto Bettmann, the author, is a non-musician who is best known for having founded the Bettmann Archive - you've seen its cutline hundreds of times alongside pictures in books and magazines - a comprehensive collection of historic pictures. He was born in Leipzig and in his childhood lived in a house across the street from the Thomaskirche where Bach spent twenty-seven years as Cantor. He even sang in the Thomaskirche boys' choir as a youth.<br />The lavishly illustrated 235-page book is organized like an encyclopedia with one- or two-page articles arranged alphabetically by subject. They cover the range of Bach's life and activities from 'Abendmusik' (the regular musical soir&eacute;e held by Buxtehude in L&uuml;beck where Bach visited and stayed four months) to 'Zeitgeist' (an article about the spirit of the times in which Bach lived and worked). Other representative articles include such topics as 'Anhalt-C&ouml;then,' 'Cantor or Capellmeister?,' 'Fugal Wizardry,' 'Goldberg Variations,' 'Kaffee Kantate,' 'Money Matters,' 'Organist Supreme,' 'Quaffing,' 'Summation Works,' 'Wanderlust,' among many others. One may read the book straight through or dip into it here and there; each method has its rewards. Bettmann's prose style is relaxed, entertaining, often wry, and yet factually solid and coherent. He repeatedly makes the point that Bach was a much livelier person than the usual picture we have of him as the stern Cantor of Leipzig.<br />Also included are a pleasant foreword by Martin Bookspan who, among other things, sings the praises of Otto Bettmann (who, by the way, wrote this book when he was in his 90s!; he died in 1998 at 95), a glossary of musical terms, a chronology of Bach's life, an index and an extensive bibliography.<br />This book is perfect for the general reader who doesn't have the background or the patience to read the more scholarly books on Bach by such illustrious biographers as Philipp Spitta, Albert Schweitzer, Karl Geiringer, or Christoph Wolff.<br />Scott Morrison5), a glossary of musical terms, a chronology of Bach's life, an index and an extensive bibliography.<br />This book is perfect for the general reader who doesn't have the background or the patience to read the more scholarly books on Bach by such illustrious biographers as Philipp Spitta, Albert Schweitzer, Karl Geiringer, or Christoph Wolff.<br />Scott Morrison	2004-04-03

The mock-pedantic sophistication of Vladimir Nabokov meets the down-home humor of Mark Twain (there's even a reference to the 1910 appearance Halley's comet that marked Twain's death as it had his birth: Mark Dunn's homage to Mark Twain?). But Nabokov did it better in 'Pale Fire,' and Twain did it better every time he put pen to paper. The humor wears thin after about the first 100 pages, and becomes more and more irrelevant. At one point the book's putative author (one Mark Dunn, author Mark Dunn's fictional creation) wonders if the book has been over-researched. No, not really, but he DID throw in everything including the kitchen sink. Exuberance alone cannot a good book make.<br />Nice try, but no brass ring this time.	2004-03-31
US	51350262	RMXQVRNCEF9EL	156663542X	414175834	Desire and Delusion: Three Novellas	Books	5	53	54	N	N	A Darker Schnitzler	Until recently Arthur Schnitzler (1862-1931) was known outside German-speaking countries primarily for his cycle of one-act plays, 'Reigen,' often called--even in English translation--'La Ronde' because of the deservedly famous movie version of that name by Max Ophuls. More recently though, his name has occasionally been heard because another of his works, 'Traumnovelle,' ('Dream Novella') served as a basis for Stanley Kubrick's last film, 'Eyes Wide Shut.' In this book we have three novellas in sparkling translations by Schnitzler scholar, Margret Schaefer, who had earlier translated several of the shorter stories (including 'Traumnovelle') in a volume called \\"Night Games: And Other Stories and Novellas.\\" Her translations are vernacular and swift.<br /><br />Schnitzler came of age in the Vienna of the period christened  memorably by Frederic Morton 'A Nervous Splendor.' This was the fin-de-si&egrave;'cle Vienna in the waning days of its glory and power, a city consumed by social ritual, death, art, gossip. It was the city of Mahler, Freud, Klimt, and the tragic murder-suicide of Crown Price Rudolf and his mistress, Mary Vetsera, at Mayerling. The three novellas here--'Flight into Darkness,' 'Dying,' and 'Fr&auml;u'lein Else'--are very much concerned with those subjects that consumed the city. Indeed, they are very much darker than the rather more light-heartedly sophisticated, even frivolous (if sometimes ominous) subjects of 'Reigen' or 'Anatol' or 'Flirtation.'<br /><br />A brief comment about each of the three novellas (without giving too much away):<br /><br />'Flight into Darkness' describes the gradual and never straight-line psychological disintegration of its protagonist, Robert. It is said that Schnitzler himself served as model for his hero although he certainly was never clinically insane. Still, he had an obsessive nature and a tendency towards jealousy and paranoia. Stylistically, the novella, which took Schnitzler over two decades to put the finishing touches to, has an omniscient narrator privy to Robert's sometimes reeling ruminations.<br /><br />'Dying' is about a man who may or may not be dying; we're never quite sure and that's part of the fascination. There are elements that remind one of Crown Prince Rudolf and his mistress, but it is not quite THAT story. Ms Schaefer comments that its applicability to our present day concern over AIDS is entirely apt, although Felix's illness is never specified.<br /><br />'Fr&auml;ulein Else' is remarkable in that it is a full-fledged example of stream-of-consciousness, the inner life of a 19-year-old girl, in writing that is entirely convincing and manages to be charming, amusing, shocking all at the same time. Ms Schaefer, in her excellent foreword, makes the claim that Schnitzler's stream-of-consciousness technique antedates that of Joyce or Woolf since it was first used in his earlier story, 'Lieutenant Gustl,' published in 1900.<br /><br />This collection makes a strong case for Schnitzler as a writer who understands the human psyche as well as most later writers, and better than any of his contemporaries except Freud who, of course, was not a writer of fiction (most people would say). His ability to conjure up the physical environs and social milieu of Vienna is near unmatched. These are engrossing and disturbing stories leavened with wit--after all it was Schnitzler who said 'The way of wisdom is to take everything seriously, but nothing too seriously'--and informed by perspicacity.<br /><br />Scott Morrisontouches to, has an omniscient narrator privy to Robert's sometimes reeling ruminations.<br /><br />'Dying' is about a man who may or may not be dying; we're never quite sure and that's part of the fascination.

The earliest part of the book, given over to a recounting of Gershwin's background and youth, is so stilted and so badly edited that I almost threw it against the wall. There are numerous misprints or typos. For example, lyricist Irving Caesar's last name is spelled three different ways on ONE page, and then the same three different ways again a few pages later. Didn't anyone proofread the book? In the book's second sentence we read that in 1898, the year of Gershwin's birth, the newly consolidated five boroughs of New York City 'encompassed over three hundred acres.' I don't think so; that's less than one square mile! But I persisted, and it got better. I noticed, also, that when the author, a former aspiring jazz trumpeter and then long-time editor of 'Foreign Affairs Quarterly,' was writing about the music itself his style became more graceful and his unbounded love for the subject was obvious. Indeed, his style is down-right perky when he's talking about something he's really interested in. Still, there is a good deal of 'and then he wrote' and extraneous material in the organization of the book.<br />I am certainly not a Gershwin scholar, but I have read several of biographies and lots of liner notes over the years. Edward Jablonski's Gershwin books remain the best I've seen. Still, I learned some new things in Hyland's book. For instance, I don't recall hearing or reading that Gershwin intended to write a total of 24 piano pr&eacute;ludes (presumably like Chopin's Op. 28); he did finish three and apparently had begun a fourth. I read that and started wishing he'd kept at it--the three he published were party pieces of mine in my piano-playing days--but of course his was such a frenetic and tragically short life it's no surprise that he didn't manage it.<br />Quite the most appealing chapter for me is the one about 'Porgy and Bess.' It is chock-full of fascinating anecdotes as well as some serious analysis of the work itself. It is, after all, the greatest American opera. Hyland's enthusiasm for the subject and detailed knowledge of it makes this by far the most interesting chapter of all. For that I give him all credit.<br />This is not a book for the casual buyer but is necessary for anyone who wants to read more than the usual biographies. I will say this: Hyland seems to have read just about everything ever written about Gershwin and there is an extensive and helpful bibliography. For that alone, for some readers, it might be worth the purchase price.<br />Scott Morrisonlf. It is, after all, the greatest American opera.

Except you can put it down when you absolutely HAVE to and then pick up easily where you left off because it consists of many short pieces, each entire of itself. In fact, it's the kind of book you can dip into. But what will happen, or at least what happened with me, is that you'll think you're going to read a selection or two from, say, the 'West' section and will look up two hours later and realize that your coffee got cold, that the phone had gone unanswered several times or that you're only going to get three hours sleep before you have to be back at work.<br />The editor of this jewel is Don Graham, who is the J. Frank Dobie Professor of American and English Literature at the Univerity of Texas in Austin, a man who probably knows more about Texas writers than anyone. J. Frank Dobie, of course, was the Texas writer  who put Texas history on the map back in the middle years of last century (it still seems funny saying 'last century,' doesn't it?). There's a piece of Dobie's, 'Bogged Shadows,' that is a great place to start; it tells of a yarn-spinner of the quintessential Texas cowboy sort, and is funnier than all getout.<br />The book primarily consists of 20th-century writing and is divided into logical sections: 'The West,' 'The South,' 'The Border,' and 'Town and City.' Each section is ordered chronologically. For me, the selections from memoirs are the most arresting, but there are also short stories, humor pieces and essays covering everything from pioneer days to the JFK assassination and beyond. There are many well-known writers here--like O. Henry ('Art and the Bronco,' with a funny O. Henry ending), John A. Lomax (from 'Adventures of a Ballad Hunter'), Robert A. Caro (not a Texan, but the honored writer of the multivolume LBJ biography, here represented by 'The Sad Irons,' from Volume I), Larry McMurtry (from 'The Last Picture Show'), Sandra Cisneros ('La Fabulosa: A Texas Operetta'), Katherine Anne Porter ('The Grave'), Molly Ivins ('Texas Women: True Grit and All the Rest'), Donald Barthelme (the hilarious 'I Bought a Little City'), and Kinky Friedman (the equally hilarious 'Social Studies'). And there's much more that I don't have room to list. For instance, there is an excerpt from 'The Wind,' by Dorothy Scarborough that was the basis for Lillian Gish's greatest silent movie of the same name set in the unrelenting harshness of the Panhandle.<br />The real discoveries, as I've said, are the raw and veristic memoirs. There is 'The Bride,' by Hallie Crawford Stillwell, who tells of being an 18-year-old bride taken by her new husband to live on his godforsaken ranch forty miles from the nearest town. Cowpoke James Emmitt McCauley's 'Headed for the Setting Sun,' gives a gritty yet funny picture of life on the cattle trail. C. C. White's 'No Quittin' Sense,' recalls life as a boy of color in East Texas in the early years of the century.<br />Most arresting of all is the excerpt from the memoir of Gertrude Beasley, 'My First Thirty Years,' written in the mid-1920s in language that is still shocking today. When the book was published in Paris (France, not Texas) it was banned in England because of its sensational content. Still, it fairly throbs with the reality of growing up in a dirt-poor household, one of eleven children, and the product of a rape. I'll say no more; you really must read this. I, for one, am going to see if I can't find the complete book--it's THAT good.<br />For someone like I, who grew up in rural Oklahoma (and felt a kinship with Texas  partly because half our family were and are Texans) the scenes and situations in this collection were at least vaguely familiar, yet I learned things on every page. For someone with no connection with Texas there will be discoveries that at least partly dispel the notion that Texas is nothing but George W. Bush and Enron. Texas is a real, honest-to-goodness place that fairly vibrates with energy, that is populated with some of the wryest, kindest, orneriest, most independent people on earth.<br />Heartily recommended.<br />Scott Morrisonhat is populated with some of the wryest, kindest, orneriest, most independent people on earth.<br />Heartily recommended.<br />Scott Morrison	2004-01-05

Naipaul (b. 1932), surely one of the greatest writers living amongst us. The only previously unpublished essay is the lecture he gave when he accepted the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2001.  Because the essays are generally autobiographical and/or about literary topics, there is a good bit of repetition. His story of growing up in Trididad, member of an emigrant East Indian family, son of a newspaper journalist, winner of a government grant to study at Oxford is well known to anyone who has read much of his work. Still, he brings a clarity and ease in his writing that makes it a delight to read.<br />The simplicity and rightness of his prose is all the more obvious after one reads the book's introduction in the clotted style of its editor, Pankaj Mishra. Immediately following that introduction is the invaluable 'Reading and Writing, a Personal Account,' previously published as a 60-page book. It is an invaluable source of insights about how a writer gets his start by reading and how he discovers his 'subject.' 'In my fantasy of being a writer there had been no idea how I might actually go about writing a book.' He took heart from the career of Joseph Conrad, which didn't begin until his late thirties. And then, suddenly one day while sitting in a BBC freelancer's office a single sentence describing a scene on his childhood street in Port of Spain popped into his head. He typed it out and it led to the composition of his first short story. And he never looked back.<br />The other longish piece here is 'Prologue to an Autobiography.' In it he describes incidents from his childhood--the extended Trinidad Indian family of which he was a part, the struggle of his father to be a writer. Then follows a lovely and loving preface to the edition of his father's only book, 'The Adventures of Gurudeva.'<br />Throughout these essays the theme of Naipaul's outsider status in the Western world (and in India, for that matter) is examined from different angles. He does this partly by examining several autobiographies by Indian writers, including that by Gandhi. He goes on to say--and this is a valuable tip for anyone interested in Indian writers trying to make sense of their place in the wider world--'[Nirad] Chaudhuri's &quot;Autobiography&quot; may be the one great book to have come out of the Indo-English encounter.'<br />There is a meditation on the art of Conrad; understandably Naipaul senses a kinship with that peripatetic non-native English writer. He goes to the heart of Conrad's style when he says 'the Conrad novel was like a simple film with an elaborate commentary.' The same could be said, I suspect, of Naipaul's own novels: think of 'A House for Mr. Biswas,' for example.<br />The Nobel Lecture does not plow new ground. It is a summation of his two-worlds experience and neatly done.<br />This is not a necessary book except for the Naipaul completist, I suspect.

We're all like-minded people motivated to reach an agreeable solution, right? Yeah, right. We've all been in similar situations where various factors have militated against easy solutions--personal agendas, lack of involvement on the part of group members, hidden animosities, undeveloped verbal or analytical skills on the parts of the problem-solvers, lack of direction and so on. And we know how frustrating this situation can be. As a psychiatrist who has led many groups over the years, I know this all too well.<br />Priscilla Wilson and her co-authors have written a clearly worded and easily understood (if somewhat didactic, at times) guide for people who find themselves in this situation, and it is particularly aimed at those leaders in the group who are 'supposed to make it happen.' Wilson, who has had 30 years in 'facilitative leadership' positions, has brought her clear thinking and experience of what works to bear on the presentation of her methods. A combination of theoretical understanding of the issues involved and 'how-to' suggestions and real-life anecdotes makes the book useful for understanding the interpersonal/group issues, for encouraging the interactive process and for getting results.<br />Using the insights of pathbreaking management consultant W. Edwards Deming as a springboard for her own approach, Wilson lays out methods to encourage individual and group engagement, mobilize energy, encourage interactions which lead to effective reflection on the issues that then generate actions to solve the problems at hand. She also suggests how to learn the skills involved and transfer them to similar problems in the future. All of this is done primarily via 'the facilitative way' used by the group leader. That phrase, redolent of Eastern thinking, does indeed suggest a gentle, reflective, encouraging and forward-moving kind of listening and intervention on the part of the facilitator/leader that is too often absent in blunter Western leadership styles.<br />Throughout the book are reinforcements to the notion that leaders don't, can't, and don't need to have all the answers to all the questions, but that those answers can reside in other group members and can generally be brought out with encouragement and skillful facilitation.<br />Recommended.<br />Scott Morrisonfacilitative way' used by the group leader.

I feel compelled, though, because this one is superior.<br />I've read each of the Sue Grafton books, A through P, (actually I've read Q, too) and I think this is the best one yet. The plot is extremely complex but also extremely clearly laid out. PI Kinsey Millhone makes her investigation without seeming to do much--clever lady. And further, she gets involved in TWO mysteries, one completely unintentionally. It will come as no surprise to you that she manages to sort it all out. As a retired physician, I was pleased that she tackled, among other things, the currently hot subject of Medicare fraud.<br />I do find myself wondering, though, what Kinsey Millhone will do when she has reached Z.

The only really stereotyped characters are the bad guys, which is one of the conventions of mystery writing, and perfectly acceptable to most readers.<br />What's more, the main characters are hospital workers who do things like housekeeping, nursing, transporting patients, taking x-rays, delivering meals and the like. They are portrayed in loving and apt detail, humanizing the people who really make a big hospital run. Much is made of the stressing working conditions of hospital employees, certainly a big issue in these days of Corporate Medicine.<br />The mystery is solved, neatly dispatched by our main character, Lenny Moss, a custodian and union rep in the hospital. He's a really good guy with both heart and brains. I really look forward to reading more 'Lenny Moss' books by author Timothy Sheard, himself a critical care nurse.<br />Recommended.<br />Scott Morrison	2003-07-20

Her main thesis is that it was during the latter part of the 1910s and the whole of the 1920s, and particularly in New York, that American composers developed a modernity that was wholly theirs, not something borrowed from Europe. Of course, there were predecessors--giants like Charles Ives--but they were still largely being ignored. It wasn't until a nucleus of composers, patrons, and fledgling arts organizations began coalescing in New York that the American voice finally emerged and was being heard. Beginning with visionaries like Leo Ornstein in the 1910s, this group soon included such rugged individualists as Dane Rudhyar, Edgard Var&egrave;se, Carl Ruggles, Henry Cowell, George Antheil, Roger Sessions, Aaron Copland. And individual voices they were, but they recognized, or at least some of them did, that they needed to band together in a sort of artistic and political brotherhood to get their works performed and published. Such efforts as 'Musical Quarterly,' the League of Composers, 'Musical Review,' 'Modern Music,' the Copland-Sessions Concerts and many more came into being. Music journalists (and promoters) like Carl van Vechten and Paul Rosenfield called wider attention to this new music.<br />This was a heady time. Of course, not all of the excitement was in New York. But many musicians from outside New York were attracted there. For instance, Ruth Crawford, later Ruth Crawford Seeger and one of the most original voices of all, came from Chicago late in the 1920s. Artistic ferment, not only in music but in all the arts, made New York THE place to be.<br />The book mentions and discusses the works of many composers that are not very well remembered today--but whose music may be due some sort of revival of interest--like Marion Bauer, Louis Gruenberg, William Grant Still, Emerson Whithorne, Frederick Jacobi. And of course composers now very well-known are discussed: Aaron Copland, Virgil Thomson, Roy Harris, Carlos Ch&aacute;vez, Walter Piston.<br />There is a chapter on the widening influence of jazz on American concert music and a description of the famous Aeolian Hall concert in 1924 that introduced Gershwin's 'Rhapsody in Blue,' (and Zez Confrey's 'Kitten on the Keys,' as well!).<br />A good deal of engaging prose is written about the wealthy and fiercely devoted women who were important, even crucial, patrons of modern music: Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, Blanche Walton, Alma Morgenthau Wertheim.<br />There are many illustrations--concert programs, pictures of musicians and the like. Particularly interesting are reproductions of literally dozens of pages from musical scores, as from Var&egrave;se's 'Octandre,' Antheil's 'Ballet m&eacute;canique,' Ruggles's 'Vox clamans in deserto,' Cowell's 'The Voice of Lir,' Copland's 'Piano Variations,' Crawford's 'String Quartet' and many others.<br />A valuable and fascinating 40-page appendix lists all the pieces played on most of the new music series in New York during the period under discussion.<br />Oja has obviously done her research meticulously and the book is written in a lively, engaging style. It is not aimed at the scholarly audience, although surely musicologists can find plenty to marvel at here, but would be, I suspect, fascinating for the curious general reader.<br />Recommended.<br />Review by Scott Morrison.ithorne, Frederick Jacobi.

He demonstrates extraordinary awareness of the almost unbearable difficulties that the loving families of severely mentally ill persons often endure. His focus is purposely on the response of the family, not the inner experience of the sick family member, and this aspect of this all-too-common situation has received scant attention in fiction.<br />The narrator of the book is the twin brother of a young woman whose erratic behavior has been written off as merely eccentric for years until she is placed in an Italian hospital during an 'episode,' as it's referred to, and his and the family's initially grudging recognition of the extent of her illness. The narrator himself finds that he has powerful resistance to accepting the validity of her diagnosis. I hesitate to say more for fear I will spoil the suspense that Hunter so carefully sets up in his tersely written novel, but suspect you will not be able to put this book down once you've started it.<br />I have intense admiration for Hunter's ability to describe what I have seen so many times in my own practice. I have repeatedly observed the kinds of self-protective distortions and myths that grow up in families about the ill family member, defenses that usually finally have to give way to crushing reality. I've so often seen the emotional price they pay trying to help their loved one. Hunter writes about this with compassion and understanding.<br />I would also recommend a recent non-fiction account with a similar theme: \\"The Outsider: A Journey into My Father's Struggle with Madness\\" by Nathaniel Lachenmeyer, also available here at Amazon.<br />Scott Morrison	2003-06-26

D. Calvocoressi before his death in 1944 and finished by Gerald Abraham, published in 1946. There has been no major life-and-works of Modest Musorgsky (1839-1881) in English since then, although Richard Taruskin's scholarly 'Musorgsky,' intended for a narrower musicologically-informed audience, was published in 1992. This volume has musical examples and some reasonably detailed discussion of musical points in Musorgsky's works, but it is certainly not beyond the reach of the general reader.<br />Musorgsky's life is detailed throughout the book but there is little that is gossipy or speculative. Much more attention is paid to the origin and development of Musorgsky's art, with a clear exposition of musical and psychological influences by such figures are Dargomizhky, Glinka, Balakirev, Rimsky-Korsakoff, Alexander Serov, Vladimir Stasov and others. The lengthy, often obscure and confusing chronology of 'Boris Godunov' is set out logically and lucidly; Brown's exposition of its difficult gestation certainly cleared up some of my confusion in this regard. There is a good deal of explanation of how and where Musorgky cannibalized earlier works, inserting whole passages in the works by which he is now primarily known. There is a fascinating discussion of how he slowly developed his musical 'fingerprints,' with examples. Several chapters are devoted to the composition of his numerous and still undervalued songs. And we get psychologically and musically insightful chapters on 'Night on Bald Mountain' (more properly 'St. John's Night on Bare Mountain') and 'Pictures at an Exhibition.' The sad story of the inability to complete 'Khovanshchina' and 'Sorochintsy Fair' is told, along with the related heart-breaking drama of Musorgky's decline and death.<br />In Musorgsky's too-short life he wrote at least three undisputed popular masterpieces - 'Boris,' 'Night on Bare Mountain,' and 'Pictures'- and those who love these pieces, and others, owe it to themselves to become more familiar with the life of the man behind these favorites. This book provides the kind of framework that makes those works more alive for the listener.<br />Recommended.<br />Review by Scott Morrisonular masterpieces - 'Boris,' 'Night on Bare Mountain,' and 'Pictures'- and those who love these pieces, and others, owe it to themselves to become more familiar with the life of the man behind these favorites.

Christmas Day 1995 in Los Angeles at the exceptional age of 101 years, 9 months, 28 days) was an institution. He labeled himself a 'musical lexicographer,' having written several indispensable musical reference works such as 'Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians,' and 'The Lexicon of Musical Invective' (containing hilarious entries from reviews and other sources), as well as the esoteric and encyclopedic, 'Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns.' He also wrote one of the most amusing musical autobiographies around, 'Perfect Pitch.' But before he became a scholar/writer he was a pianist, conductor, composer, and champion of modern music. For instance, he was the first person to conduct an orchestral work of Charles Ives in Europe, and in an appendix of this gargantuan book (1260 pages) he prints twenty pages of letters he received from Ives. Because he lived so long he knew just about everybody in the field of twentieth-century music. (I even met him once when he was approaching his 100th birthday.)<br />The primary content of the book is a day by day account of musical events throughout the Western world from January 1, 1900 up to the death of Ernst Krenek in 1991. This volume, its Fifth Edition, contains all the material of the previous editions (with corrections and additions) plus 1500 additional entries for the period after the Fourth Edition.<br />For a reasonably well-informed music-lover there is rarely a page in this book without information about events in music history that are familiar, as well as others that are interesting but otherwise unknown. To illustrate this I opened the book literally at random to pages 150-151 and found entries, among others, on the premi&egrave;re of Zandonai's 'Francesca da Rimini'; a squib about the fifteen-year-old Henry Cowell demonstrating 'tone clusters' to the San Francisco Music Club; the premi&egrave;re of 'Hashish,' a tone-poem by Sergei Liapunov; the premi&egrave;re of George Butterworth's 'The Banks of Green Willow'; the premi&egrave;re of Vaughan Williams's now-beloved 'London Symphony'; the premi&egrave;re of Franz Schmidt's opera 'Notre Dame'; the premi&egrave;re of Alb&eacute;ric Magnard's magnum opus, his Fourth Symphony; the first performance as orchestral piece (as opposed to accompaniment of a ballet) of Stravinsky's 'Sacre de printemps,' Pierre Monteux conducting. All these took place in February-April 1914. You get the idea.<br />Also included is a section of musical 'documents' such as the Ives letters mentioned, as well as things like the Futurist manifesto, a talk by Alban Berg entitled 'What is Atonality?,' letters to Slonimsky from luminaries such as Arnold Schoenberg, George Bernard Shaw, Anton von Webern and Edgard Var&egrave;se. There are documents from Soviet Russia illuminating the control the government placed on composers and some of their responses.<br />Also included is a valuable section of definitions of musical and allied terms applicable to the modern era with entries from abecedarianism (a gentle term to describe simplistic music - oh, what he has to say about what we would now call minimalism!) to Zen (and its influence on the avant-garde). He also defines some of his own neologisms; for instance, he tends to refer to twentieth-century music as 'vigesimosecular.' One can imagine him smiling at his mock-pompous use of such words.<br />Slonimsky's writing style is idiosyncratic. He is frequently puckish, sometimes acerbic, always superdensely, polysyllabically multifactual; I counted 300 words in one exuberant Russian-doll-like sentence. He created an enormous number of musical neologisms to describe musical processes and styles, some of which have entered the technical vocabulary; for instance, 'pandiatonicism' to describe the process by which 'all seven degrees of the diatonic scale are used freely in democratic equality.' He takes sly pokes at music he does not admire but is nevermean-spirited. He gives technical analyses of major works (e.g., his extensive exegeses of the Mahler symphonies which were premi&egrave;red in the 20th century.) He has some inexplicable hobby-horses. For instance, he gives the precise age at death of important musicians as I've done in my opening sentence. He raves about composers that few others seem to care for, e.g., the Swiss Hans Huber. He completely omits some composers that are now well-thought-of, e.g. Sweden's Wilhelm Stenhammar. He tends to go on at length about uses of scales and melodic patterns, not surprising considering his expertise in that area. But overall he is fair-minded and although not anywhere near complete - that would be impossible - the encyclopedic nature of the work requires fervent admiration. There are a few typos along the way - unavoidable - and an occasional error of fact, although it is clear that he makes every effort to correct them (there are frequent retractions of errors made in earlier editions); this even extends to poring over governmental and church birth and death records and newspaper reviews of premi&egrave;re performances.<br />For someone like me who often writes reviews of recordings of obscure twentieth-century works, this volume is indispensable. For others who are generally interested in the musical history of the previous century it would be valuable if not absolutely necessary. Every library worthy of the name ought to have a copy. Slonimsky was one of our cultural treasures and thank goodness his words will live on.<br />Review by Scott Morrisonmean-spirited.

Her exposition is, at times, poorly organized; Ms Cobb too frequently draws conclusions not made clear by her narrative. There are errors of language: for instance, she repeatedly refers to the logical process of 'reducio ad absurdam' (it should be 'reductio ad absurdum'). And, finally, there are careless errors of fact, perhaps aided at times by her wish to simplify the material and use a light-hearted approach. Granted she is attempting to make a difficult subject come alive for non-professional readers, but one doesn't do that by fudging the material. She does impart some interesting historical information along the way, especially about the pioneers who forged the field of physical chemistry.<br /><br />But the book is a slog to read. At times one's heart leaps up at certain felicities, only to be slammed down again by the too-often illogical and inelegant writing.	2003-06-09

I notice that one of my favorite writers, Richard Russo, has written a glowing back-cover blurb: 'Reading Jean Harfenist's stories is like finding a hot slot machine in a casino. One winner after another.' These stories read like a novel because each tale is about members of the same Minnesota family. After finishing it I'd have to say that it ranks right up there with Russo's own recent story collection, 'The Whore's Child.' No small compliment. It has quirkily attractive characters who are complex, inconsistent (like real life) and maddeningly appealing, even though sometimes you want to shout at them.<br />I had to fight to get to read this book. No sooner had it arrived at our house than my wife took it and spent the rest of the day with it, frequently reading passages aloud to me. The next morning I woke to find it at my place at the kitchen table with a Post-It saying 'I liked it a lot. I recommend it. I would buy anything this woman writes.

The structure of the book is clever and the plotting is expert. But the subject matter here - the kind of ambition and duplicity that apparently obtains amongst older Jewish-American novelists - is tiresome, to me at least. I am fairly sure that this is a roman &agrave; clef, but since I don't keep up with what's going on in the world of East Coast Jewish authorial circles, the wink-and-a-nudge references were nonetheless frustratingly obscure. That, coupled with the distasteful self-absorption of the characters themselves, made this book a slog for me.<br />My advice: If you read the New York Review of Books, if you have an interest in the politics, in-jokes and gossip of that world, this might be for you.

I stumbled on 'Hominids,' having not read any science fiction in years, and was sold. The reason I sought out more Sawyer is that he uses real science to spin his tales. And he's a good storyteller, too. His characters are a little cardboard but a heckuva lot better than those of some writers I remember.<br />This one is a riff on the notion of aliens contacting us via coded digitized messages from a planet circling Alpha Centauri. So there is cryptography, psychology, engineering, computer science - all written about credibly - brought into play. It makes for a fast-moving read that requires the reader to pause occasionally and really THINK about the possibility of it all.<br />Sawyer deserves credit for writing stories that go beyond current science in a way that remains credible and, perhaps as important, serious.<br />Scott Morrison	2003-05-18

I thought to myself that, after almost forty years of listening to stream-of-consciousness as a psychiatrist, I didn't need to read it, too. And so Baker was on my To Be Avoided list. But something about this book called out to me and I got it. I'm grateful that I did.<br />The book has no plot - it is simply the thoughts of a middle-aged man moving about his house in the dark very early each morning as he makes a fire and then sits in front of it before anyone else in the family is awake. And since I tend to potter around my house in the dark, very early, thinking my own thoughts, that appealed to me. What I didn't expect was that Baker's character, Emmett - who is, of course, Mr Baker himself - was thinking MY thoughts, or very often so. I had so much 'shock of recognition' here that it was eerie.<br />His character's thoughts are not the neurotic sort made famous - and slightly repellent - by Proust or Joyce. They are the thoughts of a basically normal, healthy middle-aged family man. Beyond that, Baker's ability to notice usually unnoticed and unremarked things, and then describe them not only accurately but in evocative language has now made it necessary for me to go back and read everything he's written. I look forward to it.<br />Scott Morrison	2003-05-12

So much that is labeled 'science fiction' has only the very minimum of real science in it. It was this reason, in fact, that I pretty much gave up reading in this genre some years ago. But I came across Sawyer's recent 'Hominids' and was swept away. That one was about Neanderthals and was accurate in most respects. This one is about several things: the genetics of Huntington's disease (the disease that killed Woody Guthrie, to jog your memory about it), telepathy and the possibility that it could be a real condition with a genetic origin. On top of that the book is a thriller and a romance. And very well written, too.<br />What more could one ask? I know I'll be reading more of Robert Sawyer's books now.<br />Scott Morrison	2003-05-09

Jacobson II, MD (as the front cover has it) is not a musician, he's a prominent vascular surgeon. And that may be this book's primary attraction. He writes as a fervent music-lover with no training in musicology and thus writes from the point of view of a lay person. Since his intended readers are those people who are completely uninitiated into the mysteries of classical music, but who want to learn more, this approach works well. In addition, and quite cleverly, his chatty, even gossipy, essays about 42 composers and their most popular works are accompanied by two CDs with illustrations of their music. These musical selections are drawn from the vast resources of the Naxos record label and each is introduced, gracefully and articulately, by actor Kevin Kline who, incidentally, is a graduate of Juilliard and a pretty good pianist (although he doesn't play here). There are also tips on what other similar pieces readers might want to track down on their own.<br />I think the main selling point of this book is the down-to-earth style of its author. He is often discursive, relating fascinating medical, romantic or gossipy facts, say, in the composer's lives. It's a little bit like having a favorite uncle who loves to teach and who knows how to keep one's interest.<br />I would heartily recommend this to anyone wanting to start learning about classical music.<br />Scott Morrison	2003-04-28

This drives a plot with wacky, funny, wise-cracking characters like an ambitious Latina  TV cooking show hostess, an archaeologist girl-friend, a hick lawyer who is a wannabe dude, all in a mildly twisted mystery plot.<br />There is an awful lot of talk about mouth-watering food in the book and you'll find yourself inexplicably hungry throughout, hankering for menudo or huevos rancheros washed down with margaritas grandes. And you'll enjoy the well-described Tucson scene.<br />Not in the same league as mysterydom's big-hitters, but worth an evening's read nonetheless.<br />Scott Morrison	2003-04-26

Tahar ben Jelloun is a French writer of Moroccan origin whose earlier book, 'Racism Explained,' used the same approach. It purports to be a dialogue between his young daughter, who asks questions, and himself, who supplies answers. The book traces the history of Islam, starting with a brief outline of Muhammad's life and the tenets of the religion, then focuses a good deal on the Golden Age of Islam - about 900 years ago - before he comments frankly on the 'decline' of Islam as a unified culture in the ensuing centuries. He implies that the current situation, with fanatical and violent people 'claiming to be' adherents of Islam, is due to the long slide of Islamic culture (as opposed to the Islamic religion itself) into 'decadence.' He goes further to decry the current atmosphere of terrorism and violence as a corruption of the idealistic principles of Islam and denounces it forcefully.<br />I read the book primarily because I knew very little about Islam and earlier attempts to read more scholarly books on the subject couldn't hold my interest. I do think it might be helpful as a source of information for young people or adults like myself who have no background in the religion. It is by no means the last word on the subject, but might lead readers to further study.<br />Scott Morrison	2003-04-24

I'm sad to say that this one is way off form. The plot is contrived in order to conform to a group of Shakespearean quotations - a conceit that has been far better by other writers - and although it is somewhat convoluted even I, who am generally not one to figure things out before the author explains, was able to see what was coming a mile away.<br />Further, I have to say that the character development was wooden, the mechanism of the plot was creaky, the dialog stilted. I did enjoy some of the academic overtones, but that probably isn't enough to give this one a recommendation.<br />Scott Morrison	2003-04-22

The tale centers on ex-actress Caroline Fawley, the mistress of the punning title: she is mistress of the grand house 'Alderley' as well as the mistress of a grocery-chain tycoon who set her up in that house.<br />One of Barnard's great talents is his eye for detail, and in this case some of the more telling details come from the world of opera, something that Barnard obviously knows and loves. Olivia Fawley, Caroline's eldest daughter, is a budding opera star making her Opera North d&eacute;but as Leonora in Verdi's 'La Forza del Destino.' An important plot point hinges on the timing, on opening night, of Olivia's appearances onstage.<br />There are vivid descriptions of Leeds, the novel's locale, just as  earlier in Barnard's career he infused his novels set in Norway with details of that country's milieu. One comes away with a lively sense of place.<br />In spite of his being quite a prolific writer, Barnard continues to come up with fresh ideas and produce effective character studies, both reasons I continue reading him.<br />Recommended.<br />Scott Morrison	2003-04-08

I'm a confirmed fan of Richard Russo's and had read all his books but this one, even including the newer collection of stories, 'The Whore's Child'; yet somehow this one had passed me by. It was only when I posted my review of the story collection that I realized I'd missed one - and a Pulitzer prize-winner at that!<br />I wish to make only three points about this book, and about Russo; obviously there is little else I could add to the previous reviews:<br />1. Russo is a master plot constructor and this is very much in evidence here. All the pieces fall together and one realizes only afterwards that some odd little observations or passing comments turn out to be important to the plot. I like it when a writer can sow tiny seeds of plot that later come into full flower.<br />2. Russo is also a master at character description and development. I won't elaborate except to say that there are, by my quick count, at least ten characters in this book that are original, fully rounded and instantly recognizable as real and true to life. Even his minor characters - the reporter for the Empire Falls paper, for instance, or the principal of the high school - are not stereotypes. A major factor in this is Russo's great heart. He loves his characters, even the 'bad' ones.<br />3. Russo is a perceptive psychologist. The motivations and actions growing out of his characters' experiences and inner lives seem true, even inevitable, and I say this as a psychiatrist with almost forty years experience of listening to people's secrets.<br />This book will stay with you long after you've finished reading it.	2003-03-08

Reading him is like watching a lion-tamer whose daring keeps us, breathless, on the edge of our seats.<br />His basic effort is to reconcile the determinism of Darwinism with the humanist's concern with human freedom. To do so he jettisons the notion that free will is a metaphysical concept. Rather, he explains it in terms of contemporary objective science, specifically via the same sort of evolution that led to the development of the eye or of language. He relies heavily on Richard Dawkin's concept of the evolution of memes: ideas that compete with each other just as other characteristics do via natural selection. In other words he argues that freedom of will grows and evolves. To achieve this conclusion he makes the point that determinism (a cause mechanistically producing an effect) is not the same as inevitability. He uses an example from baseball (shades of the late Stephen Jay Gould!) to make his point. He says that a batter has a choice of turning away from a pitch that is going to hit him or allowing it to hit him, depending on which action will help his team. His action is not determined by the prior history of the universe, but by his own analysis in the moment. In a different game, he might make a different choice. This, and other similar arguments, lead Dennett to the conclusion that the more we know, the more varieties and degrees of freedom we can have. Thus, modern man has more freedom than did, say, the Neanderthal.<br />Essentially then, Dennett, whose earlier work in the areas of consciousness (another concept that gives determinists fits) are seminal, asserts that natural science is the ally of freedom, not an argument against it. The audacious arguments he posits to support this position are breathtaking in their scope and are, for this reader, convincing.	2003-02-25

And in particular I have tried to learn more about what was going on musically in our country during those times. Pianist/musicologist Vera Brodsky Lawrence happened upon George Templeton Strong's extensive diaries perhaps twenty years ago and realized that he was a true cultural man about town in New York during the middle years of the century and that his comments on musical goings-on were invaluable. So she extracted his musical observations, collected them into three volumes, of which this is the first, and wrote extensive footnotes that explain references that would have little meaning to modern readers. In the process she has written what may be the definitive musical history of the time in New York.<br />A side note: George Templeton Strong's son, who has the same name, became an important composer of his own era and Naxos is currently recording some of his hitherto ignored orchestral music.<br />I'm not one given to this sort of thing, but after I read this volume I wrote a fan letter to Ms. Lawrence.	2003-02-22

And why is it that critics and readers seem often to look down their noses at the short stories of established novelists? In this instance, as much as I admire Richard Russo's novels, and I admire them hugely, I will have to enter a minority report and say that these heartfelt, lapidary short stories trump Russo's denser, more complex novels. Not that I'd want to be without the larger books.<br />Each story in this collection conjures up a world that seems real: one can see, feel, taste, hear the settings, and can get inside the minds and hearts of the characters. In a story like 'Monhegan Light,' we even come to understand probably the most elliptical character, the painter Trevor, in a few deft strokes of the storyteller's brush. As always, Russo's own great heart comes through in his tales.<br />Make no mistake, Russo is an important writer. And his short stories are as breathtaking as his novels.	2003-02-17

One immediately thinks of Vikram Seth's 'An Equal Music,' which was fine, and a wonderful debut novel, 'Disturbance of the Inner Ear,' by Joyce Hackett.<br />I've just finished one that is head and shoulders above either of those mentioned: 'The Time of Our Singing,' by one of our greatest living novelists (and I don't say that lightly), Richard Powers. I've read all his books ever since my daughter gave me a copy of 'The Gold Bug Variations' (which itself has an awful lot of music in it; and yes, that pun that is more than just a catchy title).<br />The book's theme, if one can say it is just one thing, is what it's like to be of mixed race in America (and in the latter pages, in the Old World). I won't bore you with a plot outline. I will say that there is not a page that doesn't have some reference to music, primarily classical, although there are some pages that refer to gospel songs, popular music, jazz, even smoky bar music. The writer never puts a foot wrong; he obviously is a music-maker himself. There is no other way, I think, he could have written such detailed, emotionally right passages about making music.  The only solecism I detected in 600+ pages was a reference, in passing, to Simon Estes as a tenor. As far as I know he has always sung as a bass-baritone.<br />The characters are Powers's most appealing. The plot has more twists than a Rocky Mountain switchback. The prose is poetic in its evocativeness. And we CARE about what happens.<br />I believe that this is Powers's best book - and again I say this as a fervent admirer of his 'Plowing the Dark,' 'The Gold Bug Variations,' and 'Three Farmers on Their Way to a Dance,' as well as 'Galatea 2.2.'<br />NOW: Scroll down and read Francis McInerney's customer review. It is brilliant.	2003-02-15

In his subtitle he calls himself a &quot;curmudgeon,&quot; but I suspect he really is a frustrated stand-up comedian.<br />I don't know who his audience is. Surely this book is not to be used for reference: imagine having to read the same jokes over and over.

He is, like Mosley's other character, Socrates Fortlow, trying to keep his life together in spite of the odds.<br />He functions as a sort of unofficial detective who gets involved in the troubles of people who might not otherwise go to the police with their problems, and as such he serves a real purpose in this gritty urban scene. Of course, Easy has been the protagonist in seven Mosley novels by now. These short stories fill in some of the gaps in his life history and as such contain background and psychological material that I think would be important for readers of the novels.	2003-01-27

Over the years I've read most of Hardy's novels and decided recently to re-read the great Wessex novels in the order in which they were written. This is the first of them and Hardy's first 'mature' novel.<br />In breathtakingly evocative language Hardy writes a paean to times he knew were changing. He is writing at a period when the old country ways are at war with the new. Bathsheba Everdene is, in her way, one of the 'new' people. And Sergeant Troy, out of harmony with the village of his birth and 'a man to whom memories were an encumbrance', is too. So one would think they were meant for each other. Hardy shows us, though, that there is something about the old ways that is worth saving; this is personified by Gabriel Oak, who is staunch like his name. His steadfastness symbolizes the old ways, the ways in which loyalty, integrity, modest ambitions and decency are lasting values. One is led to think, perhaps, in the middle of the book that the new ways will be a path out of the seemingly simple and ineffective country ways, where people live their lives by the seasons, know their rôle in their society, get along civilly with each other, all of which might seem to lead to a certain lack of excitement. When Gabriel characterizes his proposal of marriage to Bathsheba by saying '. . . at home by the fire, whenever you look up, there I shall be--and whenever I look up, there will be you', this is taken by Bathsheba as a recipe for boredom. She comes to understand with time that this sort of domestic harmony is a haven from the harms of the world.<br />And so, while writing about changing times, Hardy also writes a prose poem about married love. He was 33 when he wrote it and ironically it was the success of this book that gave him the means to finally get married to his dear fianc&eacute;e, Emma Gifford. And it launched him on a series that was to become a dominant part of his life's work.<br />The book ends with a neat summation, quoted in the title of this review, by one of the farm laborers, Joseph Poorgrass, who proposes a perhaps unromantic means of accepting our time among our fellow-men: '. . . since 'tis as 'tis, why, it might have been worse, and I feel my thanks accordingly.'one of the farm laborers, Joseph Poorgrass, who proposes a perhaps unromantic means of accepting our time among our fellow-men: '. . . since 'tis as 'tis, why, it might have been worse, and I feel my thanks accordingly.'	2003-01-26

This is another. It's the hauntingly told story of a virtuoso cellist, Isabel Masurovsky, the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, himself a pianist. In a m&eacute;lange of remembering and forgetting she believes she has lost her musical gift forever; she is adrift. The style of writing is somewhat disjunct, but close reading allows one to catch the thread of the narrative, and one realizes that the disjointed narrative reflects Isabel's inner life as she struggles to reclaim her gift and begin her life anew.<br />The story itself is harrowing, yet tender and wise. But the novel's main glory is Hackett's use of language. A couple of examples, picked almost at random: \\"I floated out into his flood of language, grabbing at branches, but not understanding much.\\" \\"Milan is a grim, gray, German city. Its few surviving Italian grace notes dim amid chord after heavy chord of industrial postwar morass.\\"<br />The writer obviously knows a great deal about music and, for this musical reader, her surefootedness on musical topics helps make it a joy to read.

Along the way you learn all kinds of fascinating things about this almost mystical number, phi (which, strangely, was known as tau until about 1900).<br />Livio's writing is a pleasure. He obviously did not simply pile up a lot of facts until they were book-length. The narrative takes an orderly path, moving from concept to concept, tying things together rather like James Burke did in his column, &quot;Connections&quot; in Scientific American, and in PBS documentaries. You start out in Egypt and wind up, say, talking about the music of Bart&oacute;k or Messaien. I love how this guy's mind works.<br />So, jump in. The water's phine.	2002-12-18

I had never heard of Ann Patchett until my wife kept urging me to read this book someone had lent her, Bel Canto. When she told me it was about an opera star it piqued my interest, as I'm an obsessed classical music lover. I was not disappointed. I even figured out which current diva the main character, Roxane Coss, is based on (Ren&eacute;e Fleming). But, more than that, I was engrossed and read it in two sittings. Then, I heard a rumor that Ann Patchett was herself writing an opera libretto. Hmmm, interesting, I thought, so I went looking on the Web, and found this note at the website of ArtsWire:<br />\\"Aaron Jay Kernis' opera for Santa Fe is also his first opera. It will be based on the novel, BEL CANTO by Ann Patchett. 'The story describes a gala birthday party being given to honor a Japanese industrialist in an unnamed South American country, rebels enter the house and take the guests hostage. As the story unfolds, what happens to both the guests and the terrorists in their ensuing days of captivity is revealed,' the Santa Fe Opera notes.\\"<br />Aaron Jay Kernis is one of the hottest young American composers currently working.

This novel is composed of ten-line stanzas with a rhyme scheme that mandates each line-end have a rhyme-mate somewhere in the stanza, but these ryhmes occur in irregular places, e.g. ABCCADDEEB, as in this sample verse, chosen at random from page 161:<br />(Nothing on earth, surely there's nothing on earth,<br />So hopeful, so suggestive of some gilt, goaled kindness<br />Or mercy at the heart of Nature than the notion<br />Of convergent evolution--<br />This thought that the ranged obstacles to any birth<br />Are immaterial and can be sidestepped . . .<br />The eye, for instance--look how Nature kept<br />Contriving it anew, freshly seeing its way<br />Out of the darkness--as if, at the end of the day,<br />The mind were _destined_ to escape from blindness.)<br />The language used tends to be only slightly elevated in tone, and conversational American English creeps in comfortably. Other reviewers have summarized the plot about the life of a boy prodigy who becomes a lepidopterist, has a terrible fall on a remote Pacific Island that cripples him. The protagonist is a gentle, lovable man whose training in Darwinian concepts leads him to accept the randomness and cruelty of life, but whose Wordsworthian love of Nature is never dimmed.

She didn't have to give up her gem, and this gem of a song was saved. Did you know that Stan Freberg recorded his own politically correct version of the song, retitling it 'Elderly Man River'? Or did you know that Herman Hupfeld, the writer of both the words and music for 'As Time Goes By' had only one other hit in his long career, and that was 'When Yuba Plays the Rhumba on the Tuba'?<br />This book is not just a collection of trivia about twelve popular American songs, but it is filled with such oddball facts as these. Will Friedwald starts each chapter with the story of how the song came to be writen, gives a neat analysis of the technical details of the song, and then describes the major recorded versions of each song. This is indeed a treasure trove of information about these songs, and if nothing else, reminds us of the long and rich history of American popular song.<br />The twelve songs, each with its own chapter, are, in chronological order, 'Star Dust', 'The St. Louis Blues', 'Mack the Knife', 'Ol' Man River', 'Body and Soul', 'I Got Rhythm', 'As Time Goes By', 'Night and Day', 'Stormy Weather', 'Summertime', 'My Funny Valentine', and 'Lush Life.'	2002-11-11

Practically every page has a at least one fascinating anecdote. And he doesn't sugar-coat their personalities--Rodgers's curtness, even cruelty, and Hammerstein's insecurity, tendency to swallow his pride.<br />It's hard to read the book without singing to yourself.

They include Hester Thrale (Samuel Johnson), Lou Andreas-Salom&eacute; (Rilke, Nietzsche, Freud), Suzanne Farrell (George Balanchine), Lee Miller (Man Ray), Alice Liddell (Lewis Carroll), Elizabeth Siddal (Dante Gabriel Rossetti), Yoko Ono (John Lennon), Gala Dali (Salvador Dali), and Charis Weston (photographer Edward Weston). Missing is that serial muse Alma Mahler Gropius Werfel who married each of her artists; perhaps she's missing because she has already been written about so much.<br />Prose makes the point that many of these women had artistic ambitions of their own, although most of them abandoned or stifled their own wishes in order to be the source of inspiration for their men. The most interesting tales are those of the women who inspired photographers and the author's musings about photography are informed and engaging. [Let us not forget that although Lewis Carroll is, of course, remembered primarily for the 'Alice' books, equally memorable are his photographs of his 'child friend', Alice Liddell.]<br />Prose has hit upon a clever and attractive means of examining one of the factors that may inspire artistic creation. And not coincidentally she casts light on the damage that being a 'muse' can bring to these women's lives.	2002-10-28

It fairly convincingly makes the argument that quarreling amongst the various Clinton administration agencies involved in assessing the dangers of the growing al Qaeda prevented much being done about it. The major players seem to have been the Treasury Department, the Pentagon, and the State Department, each protecting its own turf and thus blocking cooperation that might have led to effective measures being activated.<br />The book is superb at outlining the rise of Bin Laden and radical Islam. It also explains why Clinton wasn't able to use the bully pulpit to warn against what he'd been told was happening in that quarter, namely that the punditocracy were already charging him with diverting attention from his own problems by talking about external dangers to national security.	2002-10-26

It's rare that she can't find answers to a her questions. In fact, she and her husband will often say to each other, 'Let's see what Elmer says.'<br />As a physician myself, I highly recommend this commonsense book on the medical and developmental questions new parents have about their children. Dr. Grossman's writing style is always graceful, often humorous, and simply browsing in the book is a pleasure.	2002-10-26
US	51350262	R3HN2A5VE93SF6	0393051293	2163541	Confessing a Murder	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Well done!	I just finished reading Nicholas Drayson's debut novel, 'Confessing a Murder.' The title comes from Charles Darwin's remark that the, to him, heretical religious implications of his Theory made him feel a little like he was 'confessing a murder.'<br />The premise of the book is that it purports to be the newly discovered journal of a (fictional) early Victorian gentleman, intimately associated with Darwin's family, who is exiled to the South Pacific, and after making a fortune in trade in Australia, ultimately finds himself on an island, also fictional, near Java, where he makes discoveries that suggest what later becomes Darwin's Theory of Evolution, much of which he communicates to Darwin by letter. The journal is addressed of 'Bobby', as he has called Darwin since childhood. He is obsessed by beetles and makes observations that are fascinating in their peculiarities--he reports closely observed behavior and characteristics of beetles that bespeak Drayson's familiarity with entomology. Drayson is a former curator of the National Museum in Australia and his invented details of the peculiarities of the flora and fauna of his island, while bizarre, have their own logic and are thus pretty convincing. It's 'Origin of Species' imaginatively admixed with 'Robinson Crusoe'.  There's even a murder and plenty of Darwin family intrigue.<br />For anyone not familiar with the inner working of the Theory, there is a good deal of painless and quite clear explanation of the main points of the Theory.	2002-08-06

Yes, there is a murder, and yes, finding the murderer is part of what drives the plot, but the main thrust of the book is the extended rumination on the twisted, complicated, unending entanglements of whites and blacks in the American Midwest. Booker Short, Mercury Chapman, Marcy Keegan, Stan Granger are all memorable characters.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-08-22

He is so advanced that no regular school will do for him, so he teaches himself while the two of them spend days riding the Central Line of the London underground. She does not tell him who his father is. And he goes in search of a suitable father. The tale has many references to Kurosawa's &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;, which the two of them are obsessed with, and indeed the boy looks at seven different men whom he might like to have as a father. Ultimately, though, the story is about the relationship with his mother and the development of his own identity.<br />The discursive form of the book is delightful; there are long tales about the various &quot;fathers&quot;. And when, at the very end, young Ludo hears, from an open window, someone playing the bejeezus out of Alkan's &quot;Festin d'&Eacute;sope&quot; I knew I'd found a writer I could read more of.	2000-11-06

But sometimes West's writing is  so solipsistic as to be almost indecipherable; this comes from his decision  to include his own personal experiences with various of the words without  giving us enough context. The best reader for this book would be one who  has lived in both Great Britain and in the U.S., because many of the  discussions turn on idiomatic usages from one or the other of these  countries, leaving readers from the other country in the dark.<br />Still,  the scholarship is impeccable, and the amount of delightfully arcane  information is valuable.	2000-09-16

Yet somehow he manages  to make us care about them, probably because they ring so true. His writing  is poetic in a way that doesn't call attention to itself. He is one of our  unknown masters who, like Carver, Ondaatje, Woiwode, most often tells us  stories centered on reluctantly-civilized males mildly bewildered by their  lives.<br />Not an easy writer.

What ties those two rooms together is the  power of imagination both to destroy and to save. Powers manages to create  a forward-rushing tale using such poetic language that one has to force  oneself to slow down and savor his slightly quirky but always evocative  prose. Two passages picked literally at random (I closed my eyes and  pointed my finger) from page 11: &quot;They drove out to his lair in the  silence of small talk.&quot; &quot;She did well around black. She  understood it: one of the big two, not a true color, yet fraternizing with  the deepest maroons, hoping to smuggle itself back over hue's closely  guarded border.&quot;<br />Powers is one of that group of young American  writers who are so imaginative, so stylish, so knowing that their prose  snaps like a flag in a gale. Yet he's not a smart aleck like some of the  others. You care about his characters. You care &quot;how it turns  out.&quot;<br />His previous novel, &quot;Gain&quot;, seemed a bit flaccid to  me. In &quot;Plowing the Dark&quot; he's back in top form.	2000-06-17

But I hankered for a copy of my own. Recently I discovered this new illustrated version of the original and must say that  it's a real find. The pictures really do help one understand better the  magnitude of William Harrison's breakthrough discovery about how to use a  very accurate timepiece (now called a &quot;chronometer&quot;) to determine  longitude and help ships avoid the tragedy of becoming lost with  potentially tragic consequences. The text is not so technical to put off a  non-expert.

He takes us through five hundred years of Western cultural history, lards the book with the most esoteric and complex information, and yet somehow manages to make this book a  breathless &quot;page-turner.&quot; His sure-footed erudition grounds him  so securely that he can make forays into the outr&eacute;, the weird, the  seemingly trivial, and then come back to relate it to a baseline of solid  historical narrative. One sees connections never noticed, or even imagined,  before. One learns of important figures who somehow have avoided the glare  of modern scrutiny. I had the feeling I was in the presence of the best  college professor I could ever hope to have, and was never intimidated; I  just didn't want to miss the next class. [Maybe that's because I knew there  was no final exam!]<br />One appreciates Barzun's decidedly conservative  notion that old values matter. He gives political correctness a clop in the  chops. He defends some currently dismissed figures like Columbus. And even  though he is not terribly sanguine about current cultural trends, he is  basically optimistic about the future.<br />Oh, to have Professor Barzun and  me sitting on the two ends of a log, talking, talking. Wait: that's what we  have here. Lucky me. Lucky us.	2000-05-22

He had had little contact with him after that, but he came to know in later times his father's story, the downward spiral caused by his illness. What comes through, too, is the  dignity with which his father attempted to cling to his humanity, even  though he was tortured by a convoluted paranoid delusional system.  Eventually the people in a Vermont town were able help him, ironically, by  getting him convicted for panhandling, a move that got him off the streets,  where his weight, at a height of 6'4&quot;, was 140 pounds, and where he  was suffering frostbite during a bitter winter, and into a mental hospital  where he was given medication that improved his condition and undoubtedly  saved his life. The author writes about the pros and cons, then, of our  society having criminalized mental illness; in this case the father's life  was saved after he'd been arrested for a petty crime, determined to be not  guilty by reason of insanity, and sent to a mental hospital where he got  the care he needed.

The music is lovingly and skilfully described. This  is the portrait of a man who is utterly devoted to his art and his family,  and who is all too human when confronted with the political pressures  bearing on them.	1999-08-19

Truly a suspenseful page-turner, somehow not slowed down by the author's use of liberal quotations from primary sources. Some of the credit must go to the  translator, Anna Goldstein.	1999-08-19

The premise is funny: murders occur at an conference about Edith Wharton, an opportunity to puncture academic pretensions. But the humor is forced, the characters cardboard, the mystery uninvolving, the important clues  unrevealed to the very end. Skip it.	1999-08-15

This certainly struck a  responsive chord in me, an amateur musician whose love for music-making far  exceeds his abilities.	1999-07-10

As someone living in eastern Kansas, the locale of the book, and who has studied the period in question, I brought more than the usual curiosity to this book. It is filled with accurate details, but this never gets in the way of a cracking good story. Some of the twists and turns of the plot are  a bit far-fetched - you could say that about writers from Solzhenitsyn to  Faulkner, couldn't you? - but Smiley makes you care for the title  character, a plucky lass who marries young, moves to Kansas Territory, has  a child, is widowed and has to try to make her way back to her family in  Illinois. The story peters out a bit towards the end. There are also good  descriptions of 1850s St. Louis and Mississippi River life.	1999-06-24

The sands at Weymouth, and the sea lapping, or crashing, on them reflect the human drama, the human heart. The book is filled with unforgettable  people, and Powys delves quietly beneath their conventional surfaces to  reveal their torment, joy, longing.	1999-06-22

I heartily recommended this book to a friend in Paris. In the book, Hofstadter talks about having translated the book - itself about translation - into French for its French edition (he grew up bilingual in  English and French). My Parisian friend took it on his winter holiday and  came back raving about it. Coals to Newcastle, or Cap d'Antibe, you might  say. A brilliant book.	1999-06-11

I've since snarfed up everything of Powers that I could find. I bought 'Gain' as soon  as it came out. And, for me, it's the weakest of the lot. It's OK, mind  you. And fitfully engaging. But the prose is flaccid, not like the  prose/poetry of 'Gold Bug' or 'Three Farmers'. And the view of economics,  which motivates the entire book, is hohum. Still, Powers at the top of his  game is a force to contend with and I look forward to his next one.	1999-06-10

I don't like Walters' tendency to explore sadomasochistic themes; she seems to revel too much in them. But this one was a bit gentler. Yes, there was evil-doing, but it was leavened  with learning, poetry (William Blake's). One of her better efforts.	1999-06-10

Even allowing for the encyclopedic reach of this book, one can't help feeling Conrad is saying, 'Aren't I just the smartest guy you know?' And I disagree that his prose is fluid, stylish.
