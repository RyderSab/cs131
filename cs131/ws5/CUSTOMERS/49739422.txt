It covers everything in <br />two dimensions and even has a chapter on solid geometry. <br />The format is particularly attractive making it possible <br />to open the book to any page and dive right in.  The <br />statement of each problem is highlighted and every section <br />clearly labeled which makes navigating the book trouble free. <br />In addition, the authors often give two proofs for a problem - <br />the first an informal presentation giving the motivation and <br />plan of attack - to be followed by the formal two column proof. <br />A student can read most of this alone and could read it cover <br />to cover with the help of any competent tutor.	2005-04-18

Indeed, the book compares unfavorably  <br />with the canonical hs text by Jacobs.  To give  <br />just one example, it takes the authors 273 pages  <br />to get to the idea  of cross multiplication [a staple <br />in the repertoire of any decent middle school <br />student].  In particular, math majors as well <br />as anyone interested in the subject should <br />steer clear of this and consider instead books by <br />Pedoe, Court, Coxeter, etc.  If you are looking <br />for a problem oriented approach to geometry, try <br />the relevant offering in the Schaum's series <br />[acknowledged masters of this approach]. <br />In the meantime, let's not sacrifice any more trees <br />for products as weak as this.	2005-04-10
