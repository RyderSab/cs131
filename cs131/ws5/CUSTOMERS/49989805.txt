He is out to prove that no group of people is any \\"better\\" or \\"worse\\" than any other group.  To meet this end, he argues that geography and geography alone is responsible for the success of some cultures and the failure of others.   <br /> <br />Sure, geography might be the correct explanation.  Another possible explanation, and one that is far simpler, is that some groups of people, on average, innately possess abilities that others don't.  In today's day and age, this is very politically incorrect.  Nonetheless, it should be addressed. <br /> <br />The author does address this latter theory.  It takes him about a page and half to dismiss it based not on science, not on any sort of study, but on his personal observation that certain aboriginal people, who belong to cultures we might not find advanced, are in fact more intelligent, on average, than caucasians.  He came to this conclusion by observing their ability to navigate through the woods (and the fact that their children don't grow up watching TV). <br /> <br />To me, this isn't science.  In fact, it's junk science invented to affirm the author's personal views.	2005-10-11

In that respect, this book failed to meet my expectations.  While it does discuss the logic behind the proof in the broadest possible terms, this book is primarily a historical account of the theorem and the people who have contributed to its proof.  In this respect, the book is a success.  The author does an excellent job telling the human side of this story.	2005-10-11

I enjoyed reading it and found it to be well researched and very educational.  Just remember, however, that any systematic strategy that makes money in the stock market will become ineffective as soon as it becomes well known (anyone remember &quot;Beating the Dow&quot; or its offspring, &quot;The Foolish Four?&quot;).  So read this book if the topic interests you, but don't expect to cash in by exploting these anomalies.<br />Also, A Random Walk addresses some of these anomalies and explains why, given transaction costs among other things, one cannot profit from them.	2004-03-28

So what am I doing on a &quot;diet?&quot;  I had surgery in December 2003 which kept me out of the gym for about a month and drugged up on pain killers for three weeks, which, combined with the usual holiday season increase in eating, left me with an extra 10 pounds and feeling depressed.  I found myself pigging out on all kinds of high carb junk...pizza, lots of chocolate, nutella on white bread, etc.  I tried to stop but I couldn't.  After eating extremely well and being in fantastic shape for years, I found myself getting fat.<br />When I decided to give Atkins a shot, I was about 20 pounds too heavy.  I followed phase I for three weeks and lost it ALL.  After that I went straight to phase IV.<br />After following the Atkins approach for about 2 months now, I have noticed the following:  I am never hungry.  The meals I now eat are completely filling.  I am STRONGER when I lift weights.  I run further and faster.  I feel better and I have more energy.<br />I eat more vegetables now than at any other point in my life.  I more or less never eat any type of grain product.  I eat about 1 fruit per day.  I consume more fiber and omega-3's than at any other point in my life.  I am, without question, consuming more healthy foods than prior to Atkins.  I plan to eat like this for the rest of my life.  <br />This book costs very little.  Even if you are doubtful, consider reading it.  Atkins makes a very convincing (and well supported) argument in favor of his diet.  Good luck to you all.	2004-03-28

To carve out his own niche, doctor Agatston has jumped on the &quot;Atkins is too extreme&quot; bandwagon.  <br />Since this diet is essentially the Atkins diet, the good news is that is works.  The bad news is that in his effort to come off as less extreme as Atkins, it is much easier to &quot;cheat&quot; on the this diet.  That is why we see several reviewers who report failure.<br />If you read this book in addition to Atkins, you will quickly notice that SBD Phase III is basically the exact same thing as Atkins Phase IV (these are the life-long maintence phases, for those of you who are unfamiliar with these books).  What this means is that when you get to your ideal weight, you will be eating the same stuff, whether it be on Atkins or the SBD.  The difference is that achieving your ideal weight is MUCH easier and more systematic when following Atkins.<br />This is a great book and it will work for most people.  But if you're one of the people for whom it is ineffective, bear in mind what I've just said.  Good luck to all of you.  I hope you all achieve your health goals.	2004-03-28

Of those who do, some lack the education, some lack the discipline, while others lack the emotional detachment necessary for making the right choices.  The end result is that very few people will beat the market over the long run.<br />I don't doubt that some very savy folks who can minimize their transaction costs can profit from momentum investing and charting.  Likewise, there are those who understand business well enough to make intelligent stock picks using fundamental analysis.  <br />What you should keep in mind is that these people are the minority.  If you are a normal person investing your own money, you must sincerely ask yourself...are you one of the lucky few in this minority?  If you have any doubts, then forget about picking stocks and follow Malkiel's advice.  It is sound and will serve you will over the long run.  Good luck to you all.	2004-03-28

We've all heard about the harmful effects of free radicals and the need for anti-oxidants, but many of us don't know exactly why.  Atkins explains the science in clear terms.  Understanding how and why free radicals damage us and anti-oxidants protect us really motivates people to eat well (at least it does for me).  <br />Of course, no Atkins book would be complete if it didn't advocate a strict reduction of processed carbs.  This book is no different in that respect.  What is different, however, is that in this book Atkins makes the strongest case yet outlining exactly how and why sugar and refined carbs harm us, not only by making us gain weight, but also by making us age.  He explains clearly and his arguments are all well supported (which is typical for him).  <br />Lastly, this book talks extensively about supplements.<br />The rumors that Atkins is all about bacon and steak is nonsense.  You owe it to yourself to read this book and educate yourself about what Atkins really does advocate.  Then you can make an informed decision about how you want to eat (and age).  Good luck to you all.	2004-03-28

This book does not outline a specific system for taking exams, so if that is what you are looking for, look else where.  What this book does provide is a good overview of the different types of gray areas that appear time and time again on exams.  This will help you &quot;spot the issues&quot; and give you a feel for the kind of stuff your profs want to see written about come exam time.  There are also plenty of general exam taking tips that area helpful.  I have read many exam taking books, and this is the best of them.  Read it early in the semester.  It will help you focus on the important stuff in class and in the reading.	2003-12-21

You are probably willing to listen to any advice you can get.  This book is a good place to start.<br />This book is good.  It will give you the right idea.  The biggest complaint I've heard is that the pre-1L prep outlined in this book seems extreme.  If you have the time and discipline to do it all, I suggest you do.  But even if the only thing you do is read the E&amp;E book for each of your first semester courses you will have a HUGE edge.<br />Like the book says, law profs (in general) do not teach the law in the way that you are used to being taught in undergrad.  They kind of touch upon obscure points that they find interesting.  In doing so they lull you into a false sense of security, assuring you that they &quot;test what they teach&quot; and other bs.  However, when finals roll around you will be disappointed if you trusted your profs.<br />This book, however, is too negative.  The disconnection between what is taught and what is tested makes for some unhappiness for most people during finals and when grades come back, but it doesn't make law school suck in general.  I find the material very interesting and profs, in general, approachable and friendly.  They just happen to fail at writing finals that reflect what they've taught.  So don't think you are doomed to three years of hell.<br />If you learn only one thing from this book, it's get LEEWS and do it ASAP, and then do what it tells you to do.  The second most important point:  Read the E&amp;E books before class begins.  It makes things SOOO much easier.<br />Good luck.  Since I know how law students think, I know you want to know who is giving you this advice.  I am a student at a top 5 (US News) law school.	2003-12-18

I will be commenting on the law school portion of the book (not the &quot;get into law school&quot; portion).<br />I was not very impressed with this book.  The author does not suggest anything new or helpful.  &quot;Make flow charts, make outlines (the shorter the better).&quot;  This stuff is nothing new.  You will learn this within one week at law school.  The author's big technique, &quot;book briefing,&quot; is a tool to avoid being embarrassed when called on in class.  This is a waste of time.  Class performance has nothing to do with your grade.  Thus, worrying about class performance is a waste of time.  The sooner you accept this fact and become willing to say &quot;I don't know&quot; in class in return for having more time to study what might be tested, the better you will do.<br />The best pre-1L book is Planet Law School (which itself is far from perfect).  Skip this one.  Your money will be better spent on a commercial outline.	2003-12-18

Making that first move is probably the hardest step for most people.  Don't expect a motivational pep talk here.  Think of it like this:  What would you give for a 10% raise?  20%?  30%?  You can save that much in taxes if you take the small step of creating a business.<br />Once you are ready to take that step, this book is wonderful.  Other books talk about the same stuff, but this one is easy to read, well organized, and best of all, the author cites everything to the IRS code or case law.  That is important since many financial gurus (think Rich Dad series) give advice that is plainly wrong or sometimes even illegal.  This book is 100% legit.<br />I was concerned when I heard the author was associated with Tony Robbins, but Mr. Botkin makes no attempt to sell or promote any product in this book.<br />Read this book, save lots of money.

If you want to know what happened or in some cases what might have happened, then this book is adequate.  However, if you want to know why and how it happened, you will be greatly disappointing.  In many cases, no effort is made to explain the why's and how's.  In other cases the explanations are poorly written.  The truth is Hawking is not a good writer.  He is incapable of clearly explaining complex ideas.  Like many other pop-science writers he uses poor analogies to avoid explaining abstract ideas.  The problem is these analogies do not accurately convey what is really happening.  If you really want to understand the how's and why's, I strongly recommend you read Feynman's work.  He is truly wonderful.	2003-12-16

If you have a desire to learn about quantum mechanics but you lack a science background, this book simply cannot be beat.  This is the only book that gives you the real deal.  A Brief History, Elegant Universe, etc. all gloss over the topic.  But don't fool yourself.  Even though Feynman is a great teacher, this is not easy stuff.  If you hope to really grasp what Prof. Feynman is saying you are going to have to really think about it.  I remember reading one page over and over again for an hour until I grasped one concept.  But it is definitely worth it in the end.  I believe that anyone of above average intelligence (which I believe most people who read this sort of book are) should be able to fully grasp the ideas presented in this book.  Enjoy.	2003-12-16

You will be disappointed.  I give this course five stars, however, because it provides a great deal of information painlessly, in a short period of time.  <br />After eight hours with Michel Thomas you will have a fairly solid command of the present tense and personal pronouns.  Possesive pronouns are briefly touched upon, with others receiving even less attention or none at all.  You will be able to speak in the future tense using aller: to go.  &quot;I am GOING TO buy it tomorrow.&quot;  He briefly touches upon the real future tense - &quot;I WILL buy it tomorrow&quot; - though the coverage is lacking.  His coverage of the past tense is bad, at best.  He very briefly discusees the imperfect, but not the passe compose.  Without getting into grammar, lets just say you'll need the latter in every day speach, i.e., &quot;I SAW him yesterday.&quot;<br />Michel Thomas likes to say &quot;Don't say it, think it&quot; which happens to be the exact opposite philosophy of the Pimsleur program.  With Pimsleur you learn how to speak without having to think out sentence structure, which is exactly how we speak our native tounges.  This course is perfect for what it is, however.  No other program, Pimsleur included, will have a total beginer speaking so much in so little time.  If you are starting with Pimsleur or another program this course is definitely worth buying.  After all, we all want to be able to speak the language we're trying to learn, and this will get you off the ground in a short period of time.<br />I must complain that little emphasis is placed on pronounciation.  In fact, no one on the CD is a native speaker.  I also have to add that anyone with any experience with the Romance languages - a few years of Spanish, a semester or two of Latin - could probably learn all the grammar taught in this course in about an hour.  Don't expect all the complexities of the French language to be made clear after 8 hours.  This course is a GREAT introduction, but an introduction is all it is.	2002-04-05

Only touch upon topics briefly.  The CDs are even worse.  Basically select parts of each lesson are read once on the CD with pauses for you to repeat.  Each CD lesson corresponds to a lesson in the book and is less than ten minutes long.  Since even a dedicated student would would have trouble doing more than one lesson per day, you're looking at 10 minutes of audio per day max.  That just doesn't cut it for someone who wants to really learn a language.  The book would make a decent supplement to a good audio course and the audio portion of this course would make a less than ideal companion to some good books.  Combined you get a course that is severely lacking.  For a great audio course I recommend the Pimsleur series.	2002-03-25

The Millionaire Mind, however, seemed to restate many of the things already said.  At times this book was outright boring to read, whereas I found the first book  fascinating.  If you've read neither I'd urge you to spend your money on  The Millionaire Next Door instead.  For those of you who read Next Door  already... honestly, I wouldn't bother with this.	2000-03-16
