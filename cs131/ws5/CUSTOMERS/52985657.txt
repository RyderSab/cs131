You insert the CD included with the book in your CD drive and start up your computer, voila you have a Linux machine. The CD contains a number of different Linux software, including web browsers, OpenOffice.Org, email program, file organizer, even software to play music and videos.<br /><br />The book describes all of the software on the CD and guides your \\"tour\\" as you check all of it out.Starting off with a description of what Linux is and the KDE desktop, it then goes on to describe using the various programs included on the CD: web browsing, file management, Linux games, email and chat, digital image editing, Open Office, even a chapter about typing commands direct from a terminal screen command line. It brings back memories of using Unix prompts at various companies I used to work at. Linus increasingly has more and more excellent software available, and the book's next to last chapter describes some programs that aren't on the CD, but can be easily found elsewhere. And for those who decide to \\"take the plunge\\" and switch to Linux, the book's final chapter explains the major Linux distributions available. There's even a troubleshooting section at the end of the book. This book besides presenting an excellent introduction to Linux makes a great argument for leaving behind the world of Windows for something better.	2005-08-24

However the book went out of print, leaving countless \\"amateur toymakers\\" in the dark so to speak. Now the book is back in an updated version which contains the 99 old favorites, as well as several new \\"do it yourself\\" toys.<br /><br />Not only can you learn how to make \\"old favorites,\\" like various bondage toys, leather paddles, clamps, gags and even the lovely \\"bungee dildo,\\" but also new items like a basic singletail, a motion detection vibrator and a toy called the \\"Titty Tower.\\"<br /><br />As with its predecessor, the book provides illustrations of the toys, materials needed and assembly instructions. With a little time, money and effort this book provides the reader with numerous ways to build up your toy collection inexpensively.	2005-08-23

The history of the game as told through the histories of every team, as well as the events of baseball told as how they affected the teams involved. This book lists the histories of every major league professional team. Now there are those who would argue that a league like the Union Association or even the Players League of the late 1800s weren't really \\"major\\" leagues, but I'll leave that argument to others. The teams are listed in alphabetical order from the \\"infamous\\" Altoona Mountain Citys (who played for a city with the lowest population of any major league team) through the Worcester Brown Stockings of the 1890s NL (who also had a low population).<br /><br />Each teams' history is given in complete and concise detail, along with any other names the team may have had during their existence, all the stadiums they played at, their all-time won-loss record, a list of their year by year record, and also certain anecdotes (designated by small \\"boxes\\") about team historical events. There are also stories and pictures about each team's famous and \\"infamous\\" players. There's also histories of the \\"other\\" major leagues, like the Union Association, Federal League, Players' League, and the American Association. It's intriguing to see how the movers and shakers of each era operated. One thing also becomes clear: each era of baseball always had its rich and poor teams, this isn't something that just recently started. Another interesting item I noticed was how many MidWest and Eastern cities had a number of different teams in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.<br /><br />At times humorous, at times sad, at times just plain weird, the history of baseball teams reflects society at its best and its worst. This is a book any baseball fan should have.	2005-07-05

This book furthers your \\"Firefox education\\" by describing 100 different \\"hacks\\" (although I'm sure there are lots more out there). These hacks or tips apply to areas like basic Firefox use, Security (some excellent hacks here), Web surfing enhancements, \\"power tools,\\" and even tips for hacking the chrome (the set of Firefox files most easily changeable) ugly or clean. The hacks range in complexity from beginner to expert, although if you're a novice user, once you get started and gain some confidence, you may want to try some more advanced hacks.<br /><br />I love with how easy Firefox is to use and how quickly pages load when I use it. These hacks seem to be designed with this basic concept in mind. While right now I'm still learning more about this browser, I know in time I'll get the desire to play around with it even more thanks to this book.	2005-05-31

Whether it's saving songs from your own records, tapes, and/or CD's, to editing songs, creating brand new digital files, sharing audio files, or even the risks of downloading mp3 from the net, this book covers it. Bruce and Marty Fries who wrote the MP3 and Internet Audio Handbook back in 2001 have written another excellent book about the digital music revolution.<br /><br />The book starts off with general information about digital audio, what type of computer hardware you should have to record audio, and how to hook up your stereo to your computer. It then discusses how to organize and play music, what kinds of music you can find on the web, Internet radio and \\"portable ways\\" to listen to digital audio. There are also chapters on \\"capturing\\" and editing audio, sharing and distributing music, as well as a chapter on copyright laws. Both authors were very thorough in the topics they covered. There were some sections I skimmed over, that I plan to refer to again in the near future when I start saving some of my own records and CD's to digital audio.<br /><br />This is an excellent guide to the \\"digital audio world.\\"	2005-05-19

This book talks about why switching to Firefox is a good idea and also discusses in detail its many features. It's also an enjoyable and fast read. Some sections you can skim over (if you have experience using Web browsers as most of us do), and throughout the book you can refer back to a specific section. In fact, I did just that to find out how to install ForecastFox, a Firefox extension which forecasts the weather in whatever location you specify over the next several days.<br /><br />And yes extensions, themes (aka \\"skins\\"), and tabs are just three of many features that makes Firefox much more fun than IE, and are features discussed in this book. It starts off with a brief history of the web browser origins, goes through the \\"epic browser wars\\" of the mid to late 1990s and brings us to today. Next up is a chapter about installing and configuring Firefox (reasonably easy to do). And then is a chapter about Firefox's features, everything from how various menu choices work to customizing your toolbar. Chapter Four discusses Firefox \\"Extensions\\" (or plug ins) and themes which let you customize your version of Firefox even more. The book's last chapter is devoted to items \\"power users\\" might enjoy, although clearly most users with a little practice could quickly learn. There's also back matter describing other browsers available. It's nice to know there are alternatives to the \\"dreaded\\" IE.<br /><br />I regret not \\"switching\\" to Firefox sooner than I have, but better late than never. I'm glad a book like this is available for those of us choosing to join the trend towards Firefox. And with Microsoft reportedly planning to charge users for the next version of IE, I suspect more and more people will be using Firefox in the future.	2005-05-10

Penczak is a wonderful writer who speaks with a style that is down to earth and not \\"new agey\\" in the least. While I disagreed with a couple of minor points in this book, I still found it to be highly informative.<br /><br />He speaks first of why there is a need for psychic protection. Psychic attack while rare does indeed happen and there are those \\"energy vampires\\" that we all need to watch out for, however subtle they may be. It's not a bad idea to be able to \\"shield\\" ourselves from them. He then describes the various types of \\"dangers\\" around, including harmful energy, the dreaded \\"psychic vampires,\\" curses and ancestral energies to name a few. He goes on to describe the symptoms of this form of attack and ways to \\"clear\\" yourself of this form of attack.<br /><br />He also talks about various forms of protection you can employ, including charmed amulets, symbol magic, protection stones and herbs, grounding one's self, and setting up a \\"protective shield\\" for yourself. The book's later chapters describe angels, power animals, and guardian nature spirits you can enlist to help protect yourself. There are also several other techniques you can employ. He does have a banishing spell, but cautions this should be used mostly as last resort.<br /><br />Penczak has done a great job with this book, it's one that any practicing witch should likely have.	2005-04-13

You can debate whether or not file sharing is legal and ethical, but no one can deny it is here to stay. Not only does Wang explain where to find files (at places like file sharing networks, newsgroups, chat rooms, etc.), he also describes ways to stay anonymous while doing so. There are also chapters on file formats, sharing music, movies, TV shows, even software, video games and the most popular item, pornography.<br /><br />I find it interesting speaking of porn that porn producers seem to have found ways to deal with this issue and yet the \\"establishment\\" still feels the best way to fight it is through legal action. The book's last two chapters describe the future of file sharing and how the entertainment industries continue to fight back. They may try copy protection schemes, but it seems there's always someone who finds a way to defeat those schemes.<br /><br />Regardless of how you feel about this issue, this is a well-written and informative book, written in the same spirit of Steal This Computer Book.	2005-04-09

This book is intended for the novice and does include some creatures not necessarily thought of monsters, like angels and mermaids. Nine different types of \\"monsters\\" are described here, starting with vampires, ghosts and werewolves, and finishing off with demons. Things that go bum pin the night, indeed.<br /><br />Greer takes great pains to debunk a number of \\"facts\\" about each of these creatures. For example, vampires who in most lore are thought of to be almost \\"glamorous,\\" are portrayed here as something completely different. He also talks briefly about \\"psychic vampires,\\" which in some cases can be just as nasty as a \\"real\\" vampire.<br /><br />He also devotes chapters to \\"monster investigations,\\" what to look for, what to watch out for, the \\"tools of the trade,\\" and cautions the reader to never go alone when \\"looking\\" for one of these creatures, and the book's final chapters are devoted to defending yourself by the use of magic.<br /><br />While this is not the definite guide to \\"monsters,\\" it is a good overall book on the subject and there's a long bibliography of related books listed at the book's end for those who wish to learn more.	2005-04-06

In the book's introductory pages, I found myself nodding in acknowledgement at many of the things she says, including the \\"fluffies\\" who take a little of one thing, a little of something else and call themselves \\"eclectic Pagans,\\" or how Wiccans and witches can be two different types of people. She pokes a little fun at the ones who for whatever reason do not delve deeper into the entire \\"Celtic experience,\\" or those who try to pass themselves off as knowing much more than they do. We've all met these types from time to time. I found myself agreeing with her that those who wish to know what the \\"Irish experience is,\\" need to visit the Emerald Isle as well as reading all they can about Ireland and Celtic lore, and also learning the Irish language.<br /><br />She speaks also of important Irish deities and of the four main Celtic Sabbats, Samhain, Imbolg, Bealtaine, and Lughnasadh. She spends time describing these Sabbats, the purposes for each, and the various customs for each sabbat. Each Sabbat has significance in the \\"turning of the year,\\" and the author makes sure to explain each sabbat's importance. She speaks too of the commitment involved in dedicating yourself to an Irish goddess or god. One thing I realized while reading this book was that in spite of the other Celtic related books I've read, I still have much to learn. This is always a good thing.	2005-01-28

Spammers have become very adept at getting around spam filters to fill our mailboxes with unwanted commercial email. The book's author is a spammer himself and he points out, why aren't there laws against receiving junk mail in our mailboxes when that is (if not more so) just as annoying as spam email? And it seems that no matter how much energy is put into fighting spam, it will likely be around for a long time. So it really is a \\"cat and mouse game\\" between the spammers and the anti-spammer activists.<br /><br />The author speaks of numerous ways that he and other spammers work, including getting around the spam filters, or finding domains to use to send spam that have been \\"abandoned\\" by bankrupt companies but never shut down. He speaks of \\"spackers,\\" \\"hackers\\" who work with spammers to find e-mail lists to send spam out to. He also alludes to phishing or scam spams, even detailing his experience with answering one of the infamous \\"Nigerian 419 emails,\\" pointing out how those scammers are able to dupe some people out of their money. He also makes it clear that he does not condone email scams. He also makes a point to refute the theories that say spam costs takes up time and lots of bandwidth, when it's clear no spammers will come forward to talk about the amount of time and bandwidth it really does take up. He speaks too of the future of spam (no it isn't going away), and even includes a short \\"spam FAQ.\\"<br /><br />While some might take the book's intent to be showing others \\"how to spam,\\" the book's premise is of course more about \\"knowing the enemy.\\" This is a book primarily of interest to network admins, security professionals and the like, but as an average computer user I still found this topic fascinating.	2005-01-28

This is a story filled with lots of intrigue, suspense, colorful characters (both among the engineers and the management), and anecdotal stories. Steve Jobs is portrayed at times as a visionary, a clod, and most of all a man driven to put the best computer of its time on the market. The story of how Adam Osborne earned Steve's wrath by \\"insulting\\" the Apple employees at a trade show in 1981 just as an example describes Jobs in a nutshell. Although Jobs and Apple clearly had the last laugh on Osborne Computers.<br /><br />The story begins with the team originally working in a small building near the Apple Computer campus, then eventually becoming so big it's eventually moved back to the main Apple campus. Stories of long hours, personality clashes, junk food and sodas abound in this book. It gives an insider's view not just of how the Macintosh came to be, but also how a software engineering team works together or works to put out a product in spite of obstacles that pop up along the way.<br /><br />The author also discusses his personality clashes with his boss, one of the things that led to his eventually leaving Apple. There are differences of opinions plenty discussed throughout the book, but it seems to me everyone involved in creating the Mac and getting it out the door were passionate about completing the task.<br /><br />This book is a fascinating look at the \\"history\\" of the Macintosh's creation.	2005-01-03

I like the book's suggestions of setting up different folders for your email messages and then setting aside a certain time every so often to \\"clean it out.\\" While I tend to be diligent about keeping my IN and OUT boxes to a minimum, not all of us are able to do that (or can afford to). And it's those readers this book is primarily addressed to. There are also chapters that detail how keep the amount of junk email you get down to a minimum, along with various methods to try. While explaining how various spam filters work (or don't work, depending on which one you use and how frequently it is used), there's also an informal \\"glossary of terms\\" about spam filters in one of the chapters.<br /><br />The book also takes great pains to discuss viruses, worms, and other forms of \\"malware,\\" which also includes adware and spyware. In other words, any program that affects your PC's performance in a less than positive way can be considered malware. The book also talks about \\"phishing,\\" a practice where an official looking email arrives in your box, appearing to come from a financial institution or even the dreaded \\"Nigerian hoax\\" emails. It also discusses the \\"hoax emails,\\" and how they too are like spam in that they \\"clog up\\" your email IN box.<br /><br />I learned quite a few new ideas from reading this book and I'm sure anyone who reads this book will too.	2004-12-16

The topics this book covers range far and wide, everything from observing nature and embarking on a camping trip to organizing rituals, some astronomy, science, mathematics, psychic abilities, dream interpretation, \\"natural mysteries\\", animals, both existing and mythical ones, creating a magickal garden, herbs, various correspondences, lore of numerous cultures, and so forth. I also enjoyed the numerous glossaries of terms on various subjects found throughout the book.<br /><br />There's truly a great wealth of information here, whether you're an apprentice wizard in your teens or quite a bit older. And while this book with all its \\"Harry Potter references\\" clearly is aimed at a younger audience, I wonder how many young people will take the necessary time to read it cover to cover. Even though the book only has 360 pages or so, each page has lots of information to cover. It's for this reason that the book requires a bit of an investment in time to read fully. Although I, like a handful of other reviewers wish this book had been around when I was quite a bit younger.<br /><br />This is also clearly a book you need to skim over at least a second time to get all the information contained in it, but as such is a wonderful reference. Two minor points that bothered me. Oberon mentions vampires can be killed by sunlight, which according to a couple vampire books I've read is not true, it merely diminishes their powers. I also was a bit disappointed that Scott Cunningham (while listed in the Wizards section) did not merit a quick biography along with other wizards in that section of the book. Scott of course wrote countless books about Wicca during his life. But again these are minor points. I found this book truly fascinating and would recommend it to anyone wishing to learn more about magick, be they young or old.	2004-12-03

And yet ESPN has forever influenced and changed sports broadcasting. This book takes a look back at some of the highlights of those 25 years, along with anecdotes from some of sports' greatest moments and ESPN anchors. Heck with the foreword by Chris Berman, what more could you ask for? There's even a brief history of how sports has been reported since the proverbial \\"beginning of time.\\" And throughout the book are 'best of\\" lists: the best draft pics, the best sports mascots, best venues to watch a sports event, even ESPN's choices for the greatest athletes of the last 25 years, along with numerous others.<br /><br />The book helps capture what those crazy early days of ESPN were like, along with an idea of what things are like around there nowadays. I remember watching some of the \\"early days\\" of ESPN up to the present. It's amazing to think ESPN has now become an institution. This book is not an \\"in depth\\" history of ESPN, there are other books for that. But it is an enjoyable, easily read book that details the ESPN experience and how that experience has changed us all.<br /><br />And yes points off on the included DVD, it's a shame some of the classic SportsCenter commericals like the Y2K aren't on here.	2004-11-17

He would make a point, then be able to back it up by using stats or his own knowledge of baseball to prove his point. This updated edition in some ways is like reading a greatly extended column of his. And at 550 pages or so, it's a highly impressive piece of work. Not only does he take on the history of major league baseball, he does so with a flair for not only using stats to make numerous points, he also discusses what events were going on in the country with each specific era. He also takes great pains to debunk a few myths, such as \\"Judge Landis and Babe Ruth saving the game in the 1920s.\\"<br /><br />I was constantly impressed and amazed with Koppett's writings in the book, he takes certain situations and explains them almost the same way one of your friends might explain an event with you. I almost felt like I was sitting in a sports bar with him at times watching a game. One minor flaw with the book's updated edition that I found: statements like \\"Detroit still plays at Tiger Stadium,\\" or \\"the NBA has never gone on strike\\" held true in 1998, but not in 2003. Koppett also mentions the story of Bill Veeck wanting to buy the Phillies in 1943 and populating it with Negro League players, only to have the Commissioner and the other league owners veto the sale. I have heard recent stories that cast doubt as to whether or not this actually almost happened.<br /><br />Again, these are minor issues. Overall, I found this to be one of the best baseball books I've ever read. Any student of the game who has the interest and the time to read a comprehensive book about baseball history owes it to themselves to buy this book. It is a commitment of a good amount of time to read this all the way through, but it's well worth it.	2004-11-17

This engaging book is a kind of \\"history\\" of spam wars, involving several people, the most notable of the spammers themselves, and the people who chose to fight them. And this indeed is a war, with both sides resorting to nasty tactics to try to get the other side to back down. McWilliams describes numerous stories in this book, from the antics of Hawke Davis and his countless spam campaigns, of Shiksaa, the dedicated anti spammer and her initial desire to try to show the spammers the \\"right way\\" of doing business only to get in the middle of the \\"war,\\" of \\"Terri Tickle,\\" a man posing as a female; of Scott Richter, one of the larger figures in the spam war and numerous other figures on both sides of the issue.<br /><br />One thing I noticed throughout this book was the exceedingly high level of nastiness and contempt shown by the spammers. It proves once again there are lots of predators in the online world. No, this isn't a book about how to get rid of spam or guard yourself against it, but it does provide a fascinating story of greed, stupidity (on the part of those who do indeed buy product from spammers), and how some dedicated individuals are trying to put an end to it.	2004-11-10

Having been exploring alternate forms of spirituality over the past two or three years, quite a bit of what the authors speak of hit home for me. The book also has a number of vignettes of scenes the authors did with one another, their reactions and feelings during and after the scenes, as well as their use of breathing and visualization to reach \\"spiritual highs.\\"<br /><br />At times you may find the authors delving into areas that seem a bit hard to follow, but there will also be times reading about areas where you nod your head in acknowledgment.

This book was recommended to me by a couple of my friends and I found it to be an excellent read. I did find at times the material to be a bit \\"over my head,\\" but this I find is more to all the information covered in the book.<br /><br />There were a few specific essays I enjoyed, such as The Irish Bardic Tradition (outlining the origin of bards and how they continued to exist long after the Druids supposedly were \\"converted\\" to Christianity), The Sacred Calendar and The Wheel of Change (essays discussing various Druid holidays), and the Oakley essay describing the \\"history\\" of Druids and witches.

While I will acknowledge this is a general history, it does touch upon a number of milestones in the history of Eire..at first the land of the Celts, then the Roman invasion, then invasions by the Vikings, then the Normans, it seems Ireland has known more than its fair share of war and oppression. It also gave me a better understanding of how Northern Ireland came to be and why there's still strife to this day.<br /><br />And also too the book touches upon the customs and people of Ireland, who are lively and a fiercely proud people. And some of their stories, of the Celts, of St Patrick, of druids, the \\"Good People,\\" and fierce warriors. There's even a chapter about what to expect if you decide to visit the Enchanted Isle. I want to visit Ireland and this book has brought me a bit closer to that goal.	2004-09-03
US	52985657	RHF106Y6469LI	0131477498	236198970	Developing Quality Technical Information: A Handbook for Writers and Editors (2nd Edition)	Books	5	29	31	N	N	One of the most complete writing style guides available	When I first started reading this book, I was quite impressed at the amount of detail provided in it. Although any style guide will provide a technical writer with most of the information needed to write effective manuals, this book goes into more detail about the \\"art\\" of technical writing than any other book I've read.<br /><br />There is truly a wealth of excellent information in this book. The authors have covered virtually every aspect of writing technical manuals and also for online material, making this an excellent guide to refer to anytime a writing question comes up. From the beginning chapter (Quality technical information), through chapters on Accuracy, Completeness, Clarity, Style, Organization, and Retrievability (to name a few), you can clearly see this book's attention to detail. The book's last chapter (Reviewing, testing, and evaluating technical information) offers tips on doing review cycles, who to involve in them, usability tests, and evaluating the information contained in the manual.<br /><br />I especially liked the chapter on Retrievability. As the book points out, information doesn't do the reader any good if there isn't a logical way to find it. This chapter points out ways to \\"facilitate\\" navigation, by providing a complete index, the proper level of detail in the Table of Contents, even helpful links (for online material).<br />Another excellent chapter was the one on Style, although clearly each chapter in this book stands out on its own for providing detailed information about the chapter topic.<br /><br />Another nice feature of this book is that the beginning of each chapter lists the main points (or topics) to be covered, and then summarizes them at the chapter's end. It serves as an excellent reminder of these points and one that can be referred back to.<br /><br />I found this book to be an excellent reference and recommend it to any technical writer, regardless of their experience level.	2004-09-01

It's a subject most would rather avoid discussing, but as long as it indeed exists and will never go away, there might as well be a book about this topic. And what struck me about the approximately 30 essays in the book from professional dominants, prostitutes, strippers and escorts was a common theme. The \\"theme\\" being that anyone visiting any type of sex worker should treat them like any other worker, by being polite and well-groomed (ie making sure to bathe before visiting one!). While I'm not in the habit of using any sex worker-related services (although one never knows), it floors me to think people just assume because a sex worker is in an \\"illegal\\" trade that it gives them the right to be rude or unkempt. It somehow seems common sense to me the nicer you treat someone, the nicer generally they'll treat you. While there are numerous other \\"rules of etiquette\\" these sex workers discuss, it seems you'll have a better time by being well-mannered.<br /><br />This truly is a book that deserves to be available, even if the topic is one that makes some uncomfortable.	2004-08-27

While there are text files all over the 'Net that explain how to do various things with IRC (scripts and so forth), this book like the other \\"Hacks\\" books goes a little bit deeper. While the first two chapters deal with \\"introductory\\" items like how to connect from various operating systems, common terms and registering with NickServ (a widely available IRC service), the subsequent chapters get more into specialized topics, like searching through various networks to find a specific channel, or enhancing an IRC client. And yes, there are lots of hacks about writing bots, whether it's to protect a channel from unauthorized takeovers, or logging IRC activities, for searching or querying, even trivia and announcement bots.<br /><br />This is a book ideally suited to IRC channel ops and admins and offers a lot of ways to make being on IRC much more fun and (in some cases) safer. There's definitely enough here to keep an IRC user and/or op/admin busy for hours and hours.	2004-08-27

Keven Nelson, the author looks at this history, from the Gold Rush days and the arrival of Alexander Cartwright (who may or may not have left his &quot;baseball influence here during his brief stay in San Francisco) to a short mention of the current era, with numerous stops in between. While other books about the history of baseball in California touch upon various teams and leagues, Nelson takes a different approach, the stories of individual players like Ted Williams, Joe DiMaggio, and Jackie Robinson, or of others like Harry Hooper and Left O'Doul, the stories of semipro teams, or Japanese and all-black teams.<br /><br /> While there are some historical points (like the ill fated planned move of the St Louis Browns to LA after the 1941 season), the book is really the story of the individual California players, their hopes, dreams and aspirations. And also of the men who coached and encouraged these players. Another truly amazing fact to me also were the number of past and present major leaguers who either were born in California or spent a great deal of time here.<br /><br /> This is a fascinating book, one which any &quot;California baseball history student&quot; will adore. Kevin Nelson has done an excellent job of chronicling the &quot;Golden State's&quot; involvement with baseball over the past 150 years.	2004-08-04

But once you start reading it, you realize this is a guy who besides having \\"been famous once\\" is also intelligent and a darn good writer. As he takes you on an odyssey about life beyond Star Trek TNG, countless frustrating auditions for movie and TV roles and pondering why he left TNG when he did, and also the $64,000 question of \\"what do I do now with my life,\\" you get a lot of insight into who this guy really is. And in his writing he proves that he definitely is NOT Wesley Crusher or a dork; what he is clearly is a very cool guy, struggling with life's obstacles and dilemnas just like the rest of us. And he does this in a very entertaining way, making all of us empathize and sometimes laugh along with him, whether it's getting another rejection, getting to play Ensign Crusher one more time in Nemesis; only to have the scene eventually cut from the movie, going to a Star Trek con, or being a smart ass on \\"The Weakest Link.\\"<br /><br /> He gives us some insights about the whole acting and auditioning process and what a humiliating experience it can be. I know that as a former professional radio announcer, I found myself relating to some of that frustration of \\"never getting the part\\" for some reason or another. Clearly Wil knows there are those that will always think of him as Wesley Crusher and he seems to be ok with that. At yet at the same time, he has moved on. Through his web site and his blog, he seems to have found his voice and a new calling.<br /><br /> He may be \\"just a geek\\" now, but I wish I could be that kind of geek.	2004-07-26

So depending on your mood, there's a variety here to choose from.<br /><br /> Not only this, there's also a section in the back filled with Jay's usual &quot;advisories,&quot; and some helpful advice, like &quot;building the perfect nightstand,&quot; and the best ways to keep toys clean.<br /><br /> Truly a fun-filled book that couples can refer to whenever they like to &quot;spice things up.&quot;	2004-07-21

While it's been a few years since the previous edition, Microsoft has made up for that by changing the book's format and including three &quot;ebooks&quot; on the CD (the style guide itself, Microsoft Computer Dictionary, and the Microsoft Networking Dictionary) that comes with the book.<br />The previous edition had all subjects alphabetized, which has changed somewhat in this edition has changed that. The book's first part is devoted to alphabetized subjects (called the Usage Dictionary). However the book's first part is devoted to other writing topics, ones which the book's authors obviously felt deserved their own major sections. Subjects like &quot;documenting the user interface,&quot; format and layout, global content, indexing, common style issues, grammar, and punctuation. All topics in the book's first part are discussed throughly. And topics not discussed in the first part are addressed alphabetically in Part 2 of the book titled the &quot;Usage Dictionary.&quot; The book's Table of Contents lists each item in the Usage Dictionary for easy referral.<br />I also liked how the authors recognized the changing world of documentation in the introduction where they point out how people using computers can be anyone from &quot;home users,&quot; who use their computer for simple tasks, all the way to software developers, who produce programs for computers.<br />While this is intended for writers documenting Windows software, it serves well on its own as an excellent style guide.	2004-07-12

But Google is so much more, and this book shows exactly how much more. The goal of any search is to search effectively with as many relevant answers as possible to any query and that's what the book's first chapter discusses, from specific words and/or phrases to the famous &quot;getting lucky.&quot; Chapter 2 builds on that with tricks for advanced searching, by refining your search, searching specific titles or text or even specific URL's. You can also search Google for images as well as text, just the thing if you're looking for specific clip art or a nice picture to send to a friend. You can also use Google to search for various net news articles, or even the Google directory which separates web sites into different categories, everything from Sports and Art to World Affairs and History and countless other topics.<br />There's also a chapter about Google answers, which is a service you do have to pay for, but may be worth it if a question you have still remains unanswered after an exhaustive search. Want to go shopping? Then Froogle may be for you, it lets you do searches on various products and their prices.<br />There's a lot of answers in this book to various questions about using Google and the many features the average Google user may not know about. This is a good book to have even if you only use Google rarely, but an absolute must to have if you're an avid Google user.	2004-07-12

There are stories from the 1960s through the 1990s, detailing the Giants' successes and failures, their post season history and how close they've come to winning it all, only to have it end in frustration. There are stories about Candlestick, truly one of the most miserable places to endure watching a Giants' game, and also stories about the team's great stars: Willie Mays, Willie McCovey, Orlando Cepeda, Juan Marichal, Gaylord Perry, and yes Barry Bonds. Stories abound too about the Giants-Dodgers rivalry, including the 1962 playoffs and the infamous Juan Marichal- John Roseboro incident.<br />This book is a fast and enjoyable read, one any Giants fan will love.	2004-07-07

The essays contained in this book speculate on what might have happened if history had taken a different course in these and other important events in our history.<br />And they are fascinating essays. They describe a world that might have been. Events like the US delaying in joining World War 2, or how the US would have been viewed by the world after the &quot;Two Days War,&quot; in which the USSR was almost totally destroyed, or how the US government would have soldiered on in the mid 1860s if both Lincoln &amp; Johnson had been murdered, as was the original plan.<br />It's always an interesting and fascinating theory to think about events and how they might have played out differently had the circumstances and chances been different. The authors of the essays in this book have done a marvelous job of portraying their &quot;alternate histories.&quot; It's enough to make the reader think &quot;What If&quot; about other numerous historical events not covered	2004-07-02

I recently installed Windows XP on my PC and knew this book was likely the most descriptive and informative book I could find about Windows XP. I was right. Between finding out about countless new features of XP as well as previous ones (and old familiar ones with new names!), I fairly quickly became quite comfortable with XP.<br />With five main parts and two appendices, this book covers just about all the questions an XP user would have, which again is why I got a hold of it before I installed XP, so I would know what to expect once I started using it. Among the topics discussed here? The book starts off with &quot;what's new in XP&quot; (new features) as opposed to 98, ME or even 2000, and from there then discusses the Start Menu's various options. Even if once I read through some of the book, I realized a lot of the material covered were subjects I was familiar with, it was still good to have a &quot;heads up&quot; when I encountered something that had changed (for example, the DOS window in 98 now being called &quot;Command Prompt,&quot; or ScanDisk or DeFrag having new titles).<br />The book goes on to describe the XP taskbar, &quot;organizing&quot; your files, the much-improved XP Help system, how to work with programs in XP, as well as pictures, movies, sounds, and also the famous control panel, which we all first got to know and love in Windows 95. The book also devotes a whole section to the online world, devoting chapters to the Internet, videoconferencing, and Outlook Express. Another section is devoted to networking: security, building and using a network of XP machines. There's also material about &quot;plug and play,&quot; another concept first introduced with 95. And also more importantly, a chapter devoted maintenance, backups and troubleshooting. There's hardly any Windows users around that have never had to deal with backing up files or trying to figure out why their new sound card won't work with Windows software or why a program that worked great previously suddenly stops working for no apparent reason.<br />Lots of book are out there that explain how to use XP. But I found this one not only to answer whatever questions I had, but also was a book I know I can refer to whenever I run into an issue with XP.und that have never had to deal with backing up files or trying to figure out why their new sound card won't work with Windows software or why a program that worked great previously suddenly stops working for no apparent reason.<br />Lots of book are out there that explain how to use XP.

This time around, the subject of the essays is programming. The first essay about Nerds is dead on and reminds me of my junior high school days as one of the &quot;uncool ones.&quot; The next one, &quot;Hackers and Painters&quot; comapres the two and shows how each are artists in their own right, a perspective I hadn't thought about before but one that makes sense, and one that other essays throughout the book refers to.<br />There are also essays about &quot;ways to create your own wealth,&quot; and not from a standpoint of hot to get rich necessarily, but if that happens along the way, all the better. And related to that are Graham's thoughts on creating a succesful startup company, a &quot;foolproof way&quot; of getting rid of spam, what programming languages will be like in 100 years (and it makes one wonder if there will even be programming languages around then as we know them today), even a couple essays on how web based software could be the next &quot;killer ap&quot; and how Microsoft may get eclisped as the dominant company of today, just as they eclipsed IBM way back when.<br />Graham clearly offers some interesting ideas and comments in his essays, ones that you might not always agree with, but ones you have to at least consider and respect.	2004-06-07

Such is the case with this book. And oh the stories these old ballplayers tell. Stories of an era in baseball from long ago: what it was like to play with Honus Wagner or Ty Cobb or Lou Gehrig; what it was like to play for John Mcgraw; or get a new persepctive on an infamous play like the Fred Snodgrass muff or a dropped ball that led to a World Series win. And funny how you get a sense too from reading this book of what life and the people in it were like back in the early part of the 20th century, as well as what the baseball was like. I was highly entertained and intrigued from the moment I opened the book to reading the last page in it. And I'm thankful the author thought to preserve this era for all of us before it was too late.<br />Dick Dobbins used this \\"oral history\\" approach to great advantange in his now out of print book about the old Pacific Coast League called The Grand Minor League. It's an approach I used to a lesser extent some years ago when I wrote a history of a local volunteer group in the late 1990s.<br />I've wanted to read this for years, and I'm glad I did. If this isn't the greatest baseball book of all time, it's pretty darn close.	2004-06-05

As another reviewer points out these hacks seem to be heavily slanted toward Unix. Whether this is due to the Windows OS &quot;keeping the administrator out of the loop about the inner workings of her environment,&quot; as the book points out or the numerous &quot;helpful features&quot; of Windows that aren't that helpful to Windows admins is unclear. There does appear to be some limits to how secure you can make a Windows network, as opposed to Unix which seems to have many more options. And while we constantly hear about new Windows viruses, we rarely hear about Unix viruses. But I digress.<br /><br /> There definitely are some good ones here, like the &quot;honeypot hack,&quot; protecting logs from tampering (thereby making it more difficult for a network intruder to cover their tracks), preventing stack-smashing attacks (thereby preventing an attacker from overwriting the information on a stack), detecting spoofing, testing your firewall, monitoring your logs for any sign of tampering, even defending yourself against web application intrusions. In short, these hacks are the ones deemed most likely by the book's author to be useful in defending your network against any kind of hostile attack or intrusion.<br /><br /> And while you may agree or disagree with the list presented in this book, this book is a valuable tool and reference for any network admin to have on hand.	2004-06-04

Jay first section is titled Basic Principles which includes topics such as what constitutes an emergency, and the legal aspects of an emergency (which although rather rare is a topic worth discussing here). The book's second (and largest section) deals with a wide range of BDSM emergencies, things like allergic reactions, burn care, bleeding, fainting, etc to &quot;personal emergencies,&quot; like defusing arguments or emotional upsets, to what to do in case of a power failure or a visit by the authorities. The book also has a list of recommended first aid supplies in the third section.<br />A lot of what Jay discusses in this book might be considered common sense, but in times of &quot;emergencies,&quot; some of these common sense ideas can be forgotten. It's great Jay wrote a short book like this that gives some quick answers in the event something goes wrong during SM play.	2004-05-27

This tiny book offers some a &quot;quick and dirty&quot; introduction to the world of canes and caning. Ms Hardy offers some of her thoughts about this activity, as well as some of the &quot;luridness&quot; of it (she mentions Micheal Fey's caning in Singapore as an example of this), and also a chapter that she calls &quot;The Craft of Caning,&quot; which is a short lesson on how to cane someone. Later on, she turns the tables by describing &quot;how to receive the caning,&quot; as well as the different types of canes and finally making your own and how to take proper care of them so that they last a good long time.<br />Since this book along with the others in this series do fit inside a toybag, I could see where someone about to do a caning scene might quickly refer to this for a few pointers before proceeding. This book is not a &quot;beginners caning book&quot; however, again more of a quick review before heading on. Still it has great information readily available at a moment's glance.	2004-05-27

She takes a number of different topic regarding it and describes them in terms virtually everyone can understand and makes it clear all who read this can benefit from using various &quot;shamanic techniques&quot; in their own lives. She also cautions in a few places in the book about those who claim to be &quot;shamans&quot; but may be using the term to profit from it more than helping people go on shamanic journeys.<br />Ms Scott devotes a couple chapters to the &quot;history&quot; of shamanism, starting from prehistoric times to the present, as well as describing its forms in various parts of the world. Even if all of these forms of shamanism developed indepedently of each other, it's interesting how they all seem to share some common ideas. I liked how Ms Scott talks a bit about &quot;power animals,&quot; I have a handful I work with when doing meditations and have found them to be very helpful. Ms Scott also does a great job describing the various &quot;shamanistic worlds,&quot; Upper, Middle &amp; Lower and what you will find in each of them. Ms Scott also describes the process behind going on a shamanistic journey and what to expect and what to watch out for on such journeys.<br />This is a topic that up until recently most people found to be very mysterious and now that it seems to be gaining in popularity I'm glad to see a book like this out that gives a good overall view of what shamanism is and isn't. I have friends that are shamans and now I have a much better understanding of who they are and what they do.	2004-05-20

It is more a book that examines the reasons for having all the various Celtic festival rituals and the traditions surrounding them, along with the framework for having Druid rituals to begin with than it is as a book that &quot;tells you how to hold your ritual.&quot; The book at times will be a challenging read if you read it with the assumption it will tell you how to do a Celtic ritual. Yes Orr offers suggestions on holding various holiday rituals, but they are guidelines to go by, not an actual &quot;ritual template.&quot;<br />From the book's beginning, Orr takes time to explain in her words what a ritual is and spends the next several chapters discussing topics like Druidry itself, the language of it, setting, tools and offerings, etc. Towards the book's end, she devotes chapters to the rituals themselves, be it an &quot;everyday ritual,&quot; a &quot;holiday ritual,&quot; or other assorted ones. She also writes about rituals she has attended, the settings of them, the preparation, what went on and so forth. These examples emphasize points she is trying to make in various parts of the book.<br />This is a book well worth reading for anyone studying the Celtic path. It's disappointing to note this book is apparently now out of print.	2004-05-18

I liked how in the introduction the author states that if you are reading this book the &quot;spirits&quot; are indeed calling you to become a shaman. And although one book does not make you into a shaman, this book helps you along this path. The introductory chapter gives a good general description of what shamanism is. The next chapter talks about various shamanic spirits, be them power animals, spirit lovers and guides and ways to contact them. There are also chapters describing &quot;the shamanic journey&quot; and what to be aware of and what to be careful of, working with shamanic spirits, and also ways of healing not only other people but the earth as well.<br />There are also exercises in the book that help you to &quot;welcome the spirits,&quot; and visualizing &quot;the world center.&quot; The book's last chapter discusses shamanic tools you can use in ritual and the book's appendixes discuss setting up a ritual space, the shamanic pantheon (amazing how many shamanic deities and spirits there are!), and even a glossary of terms. I have to admit at times the terms threw me a little, so having the glossary to refer to was quite helpful for me.<br />I felt this book was an informative but still gentle introduction on this topic and one that gives an excellent idea of the shaman's life and world.	2004-04-15

There are lots of commands listed here. No, this is not a general reference book by any means (and there are lots of Linux reference books around), but it is just the thing when you need to look up a specific command fast. All commands are listed with their syntax and a brief explanation of what they do.<br />The book discusses in a little detail about Fedora, Red Hat's &quot;free Linux OS.&quot; It also goes into some descriptions about running a shell, logins and logouts, filesystems, and home and system directories. Again this book covers the basics and it assumes the readers already have a decent knowledge of Linux. Since Linux does so many things and it's next to impossible to remember every single command, a book like this is handy to have on your desk when you can't remember a specific command.	2004-04-15

Although that bad pun would take away from the fact that the author Jack Rinella has put together a lot of valuable information in a very small, quickly read (I finished this in under an hour) book. He also includes several photographs of various types of clamps (from clothespins to menacing looking Japanese clover clamps), along with short descriptions of clamp play scenes he's received from various people in emails over the last year or so.<br />The book as mentioned is a short read and contains just five chapters (you could almost read this before doing this type of scene). Besides an introductory chapter, there are also chapters devoted to &quot;pain management,&quot; clothespins, even &quot;advanced clamping.&quot; Oh my. I've enjoyed Jack's other books and this one makes it clear he knows a great deal about the art of &quot;clip and clamp play.&quot;	2004-04-14

PLAY	Books	5	15	16	N	N	Nifty little &quot;wax play handbook&quot;	Greenery Press has come out with a new series of tiny books called &quot;toybag guides&quot; that I recently acquired. They are a sort of &quot;small class in a book&quot; about a specific topic. This one is about wax play and is written by an author with years of experience in this. And one thing I immediately gleaned from it was how to remove wax from a carpet (some candle wax got spilled there in a definitely non kinky moment) amusingly enough. This &quot;mini book&quot; has seven chapters, including an &quot;intro&quot; to this activity, setting up a wax play scene, dealing with a partner with excessive hair, also a rudimentary device to heat and melt the wax you plan to use in a scene (&quot;the vat of hell&quot;), and some information about wax type and color (it turns out different colored candles do not burn hotter than white ones do, at least according to the author).<br />While this may not be &quot;the definitive guide to wax play (if there even is one),&quot; this &quot;toybag guide&quot; offers some good general information in a quick and easy to read format.	2004-04-14

This short book (can be read in about an hour) contains a few stories all of which originally appeared on his website; one about losing his aunt (which I immediately identified with, having lost numerous loved ones over the years), his meeting &quot;Captain Kirk&quot; and how poorly &quot;Kirk&quot; treated Wil, to &quot;fear &amp; loathing&quot; at a Star Trek convention, and to not calling a girl he met back when he was 15. All of them are very entertaining, at times funny, at times emotional as Wil relates them all. Wil is a great story teller and good writer and reveals there's much more to him than Wesley Crusher. And best of all, the book was done using Open Office, instead of Word or some other high cost word processing program. All right, Wil is a Linux dood..right on!	2004-03-26

When I found out about this book, I was further intrigued and was very pleased by what I read. This book takes a great overall look at the great amount of information known about &quot;Celtic lore.&quot; The book's chapters cover topics like the history of the Celts, the &quot;otherworld,&quot; information about bards, ovates, and druids, Irish &amp; Welsh mythology, &quot;Celtic Christianity,&quot; revering your ancestors, &quot;befriending the good people,&quot; and a lot more. Reading this book brought up some emotion for me in that I felt reading through it I was being transported &quot;back home&quot; in a way, which probably is no surprise given my Celtic heritage.<br />The book is an excellent introduction to all things Celtic. Anyone like me who has an interest in Celtic lore will definitely enjoy this book and it will likely leave the reader wanting to know much more. In fact the author includes a great number of related book titles throughout the book and at the book's end for that very reason. I'm looking forward now to doing more reading and studying of the Celtic world thanks to this book.	2004-03-24

Pluto took a great approach with this book, letting the former players, coaches and execs tell their own stories of what really happened.<br />From the league's start to its ultimate merger with the &quot;enemy,&quot; (ie the NBA) it also showcases the successful (Indiana, Denver, Kentucky, San Antonio, NY Nets) and the &quot;flameouts&quot; (Spirits of St Louis, LA/Utah Stars and esp the ill-fated Baltimore Claws and San Diego Sails). It talks about the bidding wars for players, the personalities from each team, and what ultimately led to the merger with the NBA.<br />This book contains a wealth of humorous and virtually unbeleivable stories about the ABA. What little I did see on TV of the ABA I always enjoyed and finally sitting down to read this book brought back some memories.<br />There is a &quot;new ABA&quot; now called &quot;ABA 2000,&quot; but it's strictly a developmental league. While at times the ABA could be &quot;rinky dink,&quot; it was never a &quot;minor league&quot; for the NBA.<br />If you want to know what the ABA was really like in its heyday, get this book. It's a keeper!	2004-02-27

Projects like the \\"Macintosh aquarium\\" or the laptop PC power supply for example. In fact the book is divided into Basic and Advanced Hacks and techniques, so if you've started off with a couple of the basic projects finished, you can move on to more advanced ones. Very cool.<br />And for each project, there is a graph for project cost, time and difficulty on the beginning page. For some projects, there's a list of what items you will need.

With their much talked about &quot;casual corporate structure,&quot; they certainly forever changed  ideas about corporate environments and culture. I've interviewed there for openings on a couple of occasions and was amazed at the vastness of their campus and how &quot;relaxed&quot; things seemed to be. But appearances can be deceiving, as this book points out.<br />While this book is not a completely chronological look at Apple's history, I found it to be quite entertaining and informative about specific events in Apple's history. After all, not all histories are completely chronological. Having written histories of one or two Northern California volunteer groups in recent years myself, I've found writing a history can not always be wrapped up in neat little chapters, one after another.<br />And certainly Apple has had its share of noteworthy events over the years. From the first Apple II off their assembly line, to the MacIntosh, the Lisa, Power Book, Newton and more recently their forays into downloadable music (ITunes), along with power struggles among their top executives over the past decade and more, Apple has always been in the news.<br />The book also features profiles of numerous &quot;key players in Apple's history including Steve Wozniak &amp; Steve Jobs, John Sculley and numerous other CEO's,&quot; the histories of the macintosh, Lisa, Newton, Apple II and III. Interesting that in spite of Apple's efforts to &quot;let it die,&quot; for numerous years the Apple II continuted to be one of Apple's best selling products.<br />Speaking of Jobs and Wozniak (two of the original three Apple founders), they whether deservedly or not are portrayed as individuals who are highly driven, and will at times stop at nothing to get what they want, even if it means getting in the way of others or angering the workers around them.<br />I found this book to be a fascinating look into one of the more intriguing companies around today. It's going to be interesting what happens next with Apple, during this current &quot;high tech economic downturn,&quot; to see how they manage to &quot;get by.&quot; With their successful foray into the world of downloadable music as an example, I'd bet on them to find new and better ways to survive and flourish.the more intriguing companies around today.

And if the &quot;bad guys&quot; already know most of the tricks, what better way to fight them than to use those &quot;tricks&quot; against them?<br />This is the book's main purpose, to show the reader computer security from the perspective of the person trying to attack and invade your computer or network. This is clearly not a book for beginners, as the book's introduction states this. It is for system admins and others interested in learning all they can about computer security. It truly provides a wealth of information in its 500 pages about different ways those so inclined can wreak havoc on your computer system or network.<br />There are chapters on &quot;reverse engineering&quot; programs (after a brief introduction to assembly language which the book points out gives you lots of control over a computer's CPU). These are ways you can reverse engineer programs in Windows, Windows CE (interesting how before reading this book I'd never given thought to how handheld devices could also be attacked and/or infected with virii or worms), and Linux. This of course proves that even the Linux OS is not as secure as some might think.<br />I liked the chapter on social engineering because it proves how you can infiltrate a system by researching the company for specific names and charm your way into getting sensitive information, which leads into &quot;online reconnaissance&quot; and also ways to hide your tracks (or is this known as &quot;covering your ass?) so you don't get caught?<br />There's a whole section of the book that describes attacks on various platforms (Unix, Windows Client &amp; Windows Server, SQL and Wireless) and the book's last section describes methods of defense against them.<br />This is a book with an amazing amount of information that at first glance may scare the living daylights out of some sys admins when they learn of the relative ease with which a system can be compromised. Then again, most security experts know of the risks and dangers involved with computer security. And I've always felt that to defend yourself against an attack, you should &quot;know the enemy.&quot; This book offers lots of ways and &quot;tricks&quot; to do just that.ess) and the book's last section describes methods of defense against them.<br />This is a book with an amazing amount of information that at first glance may scare the living daylights out of some sys admins when they learn of the relative ease with which a system can be compromised.

Virtually all of them were quite informative and I learned a lot, but at times I found the information to be a bit &quot;over my head.&quot; This book is one of the few I've read that combines a little bit of humor, technical information, and an informal writing style into a truly enjoyable book. Each chapter focuses on a different &quot;degunking&quot; task and offers great step by step explanations of tasks and terms.<br />Downloadable programs designed to help you &quot;degunk&quot; (I love that term!) your computer are also mentioned. I've downloaded a couple already and have found them quite useful. Some of the suggestions the book offers were ones I already do, like keeping your email in and out boxes nice and empty. But there are those who forget about emptying them and discover a couple hundred sent emails sitting in their out box! Another helpful idea is getting rid of desktop icons for programs you rarely or never use, as well as uninstalling them. I noticed I had a handful of those which I've now gotten rid of. Most of the steps in the book apply to Windows XP users, but there are some steps that can also be helpful to &quot;dinosaurs&quot; like me, still using 98.<br />Each chapter as well as the book's Appendices I thought were wonderful. The Appendices cover topics like doing a clean Windows install, recovering from a corrupted registry and even a troubleshooting section. The book manages to explain technical terms from a layperson's perspective, something which I really liked. It's quite an enjoyable read, one that if you read it cover to cover will only take a couple hours. And even if you intend to use this book solely as a &quot;quick reference&quot; to solve a specific problem you will generally find a solution quickly. Kudos to the authors for writing a book that is both fun and answers a lot of questions quickly.	2004-02-04

Books	5	17	21	N	N	Entertaining and Easy to Follow	This book takes the reader on a journey to that &quot;other&quot; operating system known as Linux. The one that is so seemingly mysterious and &quot;geeky,&quot; except this book proves Linux is neither of those things and is in fact a wonderful and easy to use alternative to Windows. The book's beginning chapters do a lot to demystify Linux and along with a CD featuring a bootable Linux system, you're off and running in just a few minutes.<br />And what fun it was for me to start playing around with Linux. Of course, I do have experience using UNIX so it was easier for me to get used to using it than some. But for those not used to using UNIX, the book's author makes learning about using Linux easy. There's an introduction to Linux followed by a chapter on how to acquire a copy of a Linux OS. Then comes the installation which actually is not as hard as I was previously led to believe.<br />Subsequent chapters discuss getting familiar with your Linux desktop (customizing it, creating file directories, moving files around, etc) and also describing Konqueror, a kind of combination file manager and web browser. There's also information here about connecting to the Internet, email, net surfing, and also basic applications (word processors, spreadsheets, and graphics). I also enjoyed reading about how to play video or music files in Linux (good for when I might want to listen to some mp3's), and even discovering what games are out there for Linux users. Appendix B was near and dear to my heart, a list of shell commands, which reminded me of my days using the UNIX shell. Fun stuff.<br />All in all, I found this book to be an excellent introduction to Linux and how to &quot;convert&quot; from the wild and wooly world of Windows over to it.	2004-01-10

Everything from lucid dreaming to out of body experiences to healing dreams, it's covered here. There are also chapters on how to remember and interpret your dreams (even &quot;interviewing&quot; the person having the dreams to help them better remember their dream). There's also a big &quot;dream glossary&quot; at the book's back, along with &quot;inserts&quot; discussing what particular symbols can mean. Even if the symbols you dream about have a different personal meaning for you, it's still helpful.<br />The book also features exercises in each chapter to help you better categorize the dreams you have. It gives lots of explanations about particular dream symbols (along with the previously mentioned dream glossary) and also gives examples of each in the form of people's stories. I found this to be an interesting book and while it didn't answer all of my questions about &quot;dreamtime,&quot; I'm not sure any one book can. I did find this to be one of the better dream books available and would recommend it to others.	2003-12-30

The author who has done this sort of thing for years and years offers his advice on items like negotiating shoots, digital imaging, \\"tools and techniques,\\" devloping your own personal style of photography, keeping records, legal issues, fighting censorship, and where to meet models. As I read the book, I got a sense that Gatewood was offering his thoughts on doing this kind of photography as well as advice on how to do it well. A lot of his personal stories are fascinating as well. He also spends a chapter (Four Promiment Masters) discussing other well-known fetish photographers; Annie Sprinkle, Micheal Rosen, Barbara Nitke, and Eric Kroll.<br />I would have gotten this book just to have some of the wonderful pictures, but the information Gatewood offers in addition to the photos make this a wonderful book to have, for anyone interested in this specific realm of photography.	2003-12-18

I loved how the author challenges the reader in Chapter 4 to make a list of all the reasons why they never could do erotic replay and then after doing that, come up with reasons why you CAN do erotic replay. I also liked her comment that when fear comes up it may mean you're getting close to something that may change you.<br />This book after assuring you the reader that yes you can too do erotic replay and do it well also spends a good deal of space discussing communication and negotiation between people doing a replay scene and then goes on to describing ways to pull it off. The book's second section called &quot;The Flesh of Fantasy&quot; delves into this, with chapters on &quot;building your scene,&quot; how to effectively &quot;play&quot; your role, last minute details, and then just plain doing it.<br />The book has several appendices too which contain safety information, a &quot;dairy&quot; of a role play scene and plans, suggested music, a resource guide, even a sample negotiation form.<br />Highly enjoyable, this book has changed my mind about doing role play scenarios. I might just yet become a swashbuckling captain or naughty professor in my private play.	2003-12-17

The author describes erotic tickling as a &quot;kink for the new millennium&quot; and he may just be right. For some of us, it can be fun to tickle someone as a form of erotic activity. The book discusses topics like bondage and tickling, accessories you can use in tickling, different body parts and how sensitive they are to tickling, how to deal with problems when they come up, even a couple of &quot;case histories.&quot; Best of all, the book is a quick read at just over 100 pages.

This is material that more often than not comes off as very dry. And yet grammar is very important in producing clear, concise and quality writing. This book goes a long way in demystifying and explaining the basics of grammar. And it does it in an informal way that makes it easier to grasp all the important concepts of grammar and style.<br />Every grammatical article, be it noun, verb, dangling participle, or adverb is covered here. Starting off with a basic over view of grammar in the first few chapters, the book then goes on to discuss parts of speech, verbs, pronouns, adjectives, prepositional phrases, clauses, even chapters on proper punctuation and spelling. It does all this in a way that keeps your attention. If only my English teachers way back when could have kept this material interesting.<br />There's even a section near the book's end about business writing, be it cover letters, resumes, memos or email. This proves how important good clear writing is in the business world as well as everywhere else. And also, this is a book you can refer back to when faced with a &quot;grammar question,&quot; since it's also a good &quot;grammar reference&quot; book. If you do a lot of writing, either for business or pleasure this is an excellent book to have around.	2003-12-11

Part 1 titled &quot;Information Overload&quot; deals with subjects like finding information by using search engines, methods of finding &quot;alternative sources of news,&quot; getting past Internet filters and parental control software, online activism, and hate groups. Part 2 discusses &quot;Internet Threats,&quot; like viruses, and Internet con games. Part 3 describes how to &quot;break in and enter a computer (and it's fairly easy to do) and Part 4 discusses how to keep people from breaking in to your computer (nice of Wallace to do that I'd say), as well as a great chapter called &quot;Computing on a Shoestring (finding cheap computers and software for it). Part 5 also discusses ways to protect your computer (firewalls, ways to delete sensitive data beyond recovery) and the book's first Appendix describes software that can be used for all of these various computer tasks. Another appendix describes a &quot;hacker's gallery of rogue tools&quot; for &quot;hacking&quot; or &quot;cracking other folks' computers.<br />Wang takes great pains to say that none of these tools or information should be used to do anything illegal, however I suspect a number of people will anyway. Still, I feel it's better to be prepared for that possibility than to do nothing when it comes to using your computer or being on the Internet.<br />I found this book to be a valuable resource, one that I intend to refer to whenever a privacy or &quot;hacker issue&quot; comes up for me.ever a privacy or &quot;hacker issue&quot; comes up for me.	2003-12-05

From &quot;tweaking&quot; a setting to downloading numerous utilities to help &quot;fix&quot; an annoyance, there's lots of solid information in the book.<br />The book's seven chapters are divided into email annoyances (even subsections on dealing with Eudora, Outlook Express, AOL, Hotmail, etc), Windows issues, Internet problems, Microsoft Office workarounds, Windows Explorer, Music, Video and CD issues, and finally Hardware issues. I've already downloaded a couple of utilities the book suggests and plan to get a few more.<br />I tend to get rather frustrated at times with my PC and a book like this helps to make using my PC much easier and enjoyable.	2003-12-01

While I don't find myself \\"travelling to the Other Side\\" often when I dream, I found her explanations plausible. And I definitely agree with her assessment that dream dictionaries are fine, but a symbol in a dream may mean something entirely different to each individual. I liked her \\"dividing\\" dreams into five types, including prophetic dreams, an informational or problem-solving dream, and astral visits.<br />Sylvia goes into detail to describe each of these \\"dream types,\\" and points out in our society people don't give enough credit to dreams. She does spend a chapter describing dream symbols, and it's as good a \\"dream dictionary\\" as any I've seen.<br />She also describes ways to make a dream (especially a bad one) end differently by \\"telling yourself\\" it's only a dream and to \\"choose\\" a different ending to a recurring bad dream.<br />I felt Sylvia did a very good job in describing dreams and what they mean or may not mean. Several dream books I've skimmed through seem to follow a \\"template\\" of sorts in trying to explain what your dreams mean. And Sylvia went out of her way to do the opposite in explaining dreams.<br />I'm glad I took the time to read this book.	2003-11-30
US	52985657	R1HIEM2OKMIXZJ	0028617347	730712305	The Complete Idiot's Guide to Creative Writing	Books	4	39	39	N	N	Nice resource for beginning writers	As someone who is thinking of writing both fiction and non-fiction, I found this book to have lots of good information about how and where to start writing. From writing fiction, non-fiction, poetry, screenplays and the like, the author offers a lot of good information. I'm also a technical writer and one thing that is stressed there is the need for brevity. Well the author also stresses that for good prose, you also need brevity in writing. Keep it simple in other words. There are also &quot;charts&quot; to use in writing a fictional piece, be it novel or short story. From characters, main and minor to settings to conflicts to resolution. The author also stresses the use of outlines when writing fiction. Again just like what technical writers do when they start writing a manual of some kind.<br />There's also a chapter about writing biographies and autobiographies, with tips on the information you need to gather before you start in on one. And a chapter on writing text and reference books. I had no idea there was a need for books like these. And too another important point the author stresses is the need to decide the audience you are writing for. Still another parallel to the technical writing world, where determining your audience beforehand is a crucial part of the process.<br />The book's last few chapters could be called the most important, because they deal with selling your work, from fiction and poetry to nonfiction. There's a chapter about literary agents, and whether or not you need one. Also one on legal contracts and fees, and ways to find out about writing contests and getting government grants for your writing work.<br />Finally, the book talks about editors which at times I've felt were a &quot;necessary evil&quot; to writing. As great as you think your work is (including this review), it can always be improved upon by a good editor. Finally, there's a chapter on overcoming writer's block. This is a good thing, as any writer has encountered this beast at one time or another.<br />I found this book to be entertaining and informative and would recommend it to any writer, especially beginning writers.t at one time or another.<br />I found this book to be entertaining and informative and would recommend it to any writer, especially beginning writers.	2003-11-19

Not only are there a wealth of pictures and facts about all the current (and some past) major league ballparks, there are also the \\"stories\\" behind each of these facilities. There are also a number of minor league and Negro league parks mentioned as well. It's clear this book is a true labor of love by the author. My \\"West Coast bias\\" is showing, because I was hoping to see Sacramento's Raley Field (a gorgeous minor league park) mentioned here, but alas it isn't. Oh well, it's a very minor disappointment. And seeing as how a large number of gorgeous minor league parks are now opening across the country, perhaps Mr Leventhal's next project could be a book about minor league parks? As I leafed through its pages, I found myself realizing that next season I need to go on a \\"road trip\\" to experience some of these stadiums in person.<br />The book is remarkable in its scope. It starts off by describing the \\"history\\" of ballparks, from the rickety old parks of the 19th century to the 'retro\\" parks of the early 21st century. And with these retro ballparks of today being built, it's piqued people's interest in learning more about the various major league ballparks across the US and into Canada. And in addition to descriptions of every current major league ballpark, there are also features on stadium PA announcers, mascots, ballpark food, groundskeepers, even a page or two on which parks are \\"home runs havens' and which are \\"pitcher's dreams.\\"<br />Any baseball fan will adore this book.	2003-11-18

I found Sylvia's descriptions of ghosts she has encountered over the years to be fascinating, frightening, and intriguing at the same time. She points out that spirits will always be friendly, whereas a ghost may not be. Some of the stories are chilling, such as her encounters with Bela Lugosi and Elizabeth Short (aka the Black Dahlia). Others are sad, like her encounters with the Sunnyvale Toys R US ghost who still tends to the farm that was there 100 years ago. Or the servants at the Winchester Mystery House who tend to her house even though Sarah Winchester is long gone. I find it sad somehow these ghosts have not found their way to the other side.<br />I also found intriguing the stories Sylvia tells of \\"psychic imprints,\\" places that still hold terrible memories of violence done long long ago. I also enjoyed the chapter on psychic attacks, and how to banish them. Having dealt with a handful of them, I'd like to see more on this subject in her future books.<br />I am disappointed at those who choose to call Sylvia a \\"fraud\\" or claim she is doing the \\"devil's work.\\" Somehow if that were really true, I seriously doubt Sylvia would have done all this work for so many years and received letters from so many who have experienced contact with ghosts or spirits of their departed love ones. I don't always agree with everything Sylvia says, but I find enough of it resonates with me.<br />I've become more interested over the last several months in the spirit world and I found this book answered quite a few of my questions.	2003-11-10

As another reviewer has pointed out, this book is not a &quot;how to do BDSM manual,&quot; instead it covers more of the emotional and mental aspects of doing BDSM. And each of the chapters finishes with an erotic SM story, one that fits the topic just discussed in the chapter. Topics the author covers include myths about SM and demystifying them, communication &amp; negotiation, impact play, developing role preferences, different SM relationships, finding community, and even a chapter on edge play. Although some of this chapter some might feel is not necessarily edge play. Your mileage may vary.<br />Califia also takes a realistic attitude about doing SM throughout the book, pointing out for example that what may really hot in your mind (like a full on 24/7 D/s relationship) may not be practical when it comes to things like doing shopping or picking up the dry cleaning, or holding down a 9 to 5 job every day. Or that your Top may have a bad day or not be perfect at all times. Reality rears its ugly head.<br />Califia even includes a glossary of terms in the back, a resource guide, and further reading material. While the book is aimed primarily toward people new to BDSM, there's enough material here that even so-called &quot;veteran&quot; SM players will enjoy reading. Califia is a long time community member and his experience shows in the writing of this book.	2003-10-15

The author places himself in the shoes of the average person struggling to set up their own wireless network in either a business or home situation.<br />The book's first chapter describes how \\"wi-fi\\" works, and the next chapter explains the \\"materials\\" you need to set up a wireless network. The next couple of chapters describe how to install network access points and interfaces. Since I have some knowledge of LAN's, I was able to see the \\"comparisons\\" between conventional networks and wireless. I'm assuming that was what the author had in mind while writing the book.<br />He also talks about extending your wireless network, guerilla (ie \\"illegal\\") networking. and security for wireless networks. I was glad to see that chapter, as I had heard it could be relatively easy to \\"interrupt\\" network traffic, as well as breaking into a wireless network illegally. While the author points out no wi-fi network will ever be 100% safe, better to be safe than sorry. And last but not least, the book's final chapter is on troubleshooting your network.<br />I found this book to be a great introduction to wireless networks.	2003-10-08

But I think this is due much more to my inexperience with eBay than anything else. And after reading this book I will attest that it has increased my curiosity and willingness to both buy and sell items on eBay in the future.<br />The book offers numerous excellent \\"tips\\" (er hacks) in several main areas. As with other books in the O'Reilly Hacks series, these areas are divided into several chapters. Areas covered in various chapters include Diplomacy and Feedback, searching for auction items, ways to bid on items offered, using photos to help \\"sell\\" your items, and completing transactions.<br />If you do any buying and/or selling on eBay, you need this book.	2003-10-02

He has divided each chapter into their own &quot;half innings,&quot; the &quot;top half&quot; being about a particular topic, and the &quot;bottom half&quot; being various lists. In between, his stories and opinions I found to be quite entertaining and even in some cases thought-provoking. Whether it's relaying old baseball anecdotes involving Hall of Famers like Yogi Berra, Ted Williams &amp; Joe DiMaggio, or old Negro League ballplayers he got to know during his stint as Commissioner, or stories about his friendship with both George Bush and his son (a one time Texas Rangers owner), or more serious topics like the suspension of Pete Rose, his time and friendship with Bart Giamatti (the commissioner he succeeded in office after Giamatti's death), or his experiences at the earthquake-marred 1989 World Series, the reader is certainly never bored. I especially found his story about this fascinating, as I was among the crowd at that game 3 some thirteen years ago now. I never realized how much Isaiah Nelson, a SF cop on duty at the game helped to orchestrate the orderly evacuation of the park.<br />After reading his thoughts on Rose, I as well as another reviewer have come to change my mind about whether Rose should be re admitted to the game (although as of this review, pressure to reinstate Rose in some capacity seems to be growing). I also agreed with him about Steve Howe, whose continued readmittance to baseball after several drug convictions in my humble opinion marred the game. When Vincent resigned as commissioner of baseball in 1992, I felt the game has been deprived of a leader, even if I sometimes disagreed with his decisions. I wouldn't call this book a &quot;great masterpiece,&quot; but I'm glad I ignored a couple of negative reviews I've seen of it. This book is an enjoyable read and makes me wonder how different today's game might have been if Vincent had been allowed to at least finish out his term as commissioner, much less be commissioner today.had been allowed to at least finish out his term as commissioner, much less be commissioner today.	2003-09-26

UNIX is of course a complex OS, and yet even novices can use UNIX after learning a few simple commands. And yet one can also harness much more of UNIX's power by learning its complexities. This book is an excellent reference, showing just how much more useful UNIX can be when you keep learning more about it. It is full of tips and information designed to make your time using UNIX to be more efficient and even fun.<br />With a book of over 1000 pages, there's something on virtually every topic of UNIX here. And you can \\"jump around\\" to different parts of the book to learn more about a particular feature or \\"power tool.\\" Vi for example has always been a favorite of mine, much to the chagrin of some of my friends, and there's a chapter or two of Vi \\"tricks\\" to try out. Emacs is a screen editor that I also like, and again there's a chapter devoted to \\"EMACS tricks.\\" Of course in a book this size, just about everything imaginable regarding the UNIX operating system is covered here, everything from customizing and interacting with your shell environment, to working with files and directories, the UNIX kernel, lots of information about scripting, to security issues.<br />Whether you're a UNIX programmer, sys admin, or \\"UNIX hobbyist\\" like me, this book is an invaluable resource.	2003-09-10

While I was familiar with wish lists, posting reviews and the like, this book proved me wrong, as I learned about numerous other features (especially movie show times!) that Amazon offers. Among the features are finding individual ASIN's (Amazon Standard Item Number) for each product listed on Amazon, switching to a text-only Amazon (good if you want Amazon's site to load quickly), \\"power searching\\" on books, linking to personal Amazon reviews from your own web site, and countless others. There are also hacks designed to make it more convenient to sell items through Amazon, or participate in the Amazon community, even some hacks designed to let you use Amazon's Web Services. I'm not a programmer, so I'm not interested in those hacks specifically, but they do show how Amazon's Web Services can be used to create alternative interfaces that may be of use to Amazon or other fellow programmers.<br />Amazon Hacks shows how by using some \\"tricks,\\" you can make your own use of Amazon and its numerous services that much more enjoyable and useful.

Sylvia describes the various \\"levels\\" of angels, pointing out that no \\"group\\" is really \\"better\\" than any other, just that each level has their own purpose. Sylvia also includes letters she has received from people describing their \\"angel experiences.\\" After reading them, I now realize more than ever that indeed I also have had a handful of these experiences. The book's first chapter even features an \\"Angel Chart\\" describing each type of angel. Subsequent chapters describe the different types of angels, and there's even a \\"frequently asked questions\\" chapter near the book's end. Another nice touch are the meditations at the end of each chapter, everything from healing, protection, dealing with troubled times to asking angels to surround you.<br />There are those who don't believe in angels, which is fine. But when you see angels of some kind or another in all walks of life, you have to believe that somehow they are with us. This book affirms that angels are among us.	2003-08-18

This latest edition shows James at his finest, in the form of numerous essays and thoughts about the game, ranging from the &quot;history&quot; he provides of the game from the 1870's through the end of the 1990s to his 100 best players at each position. Argue all you want about his selections (and what baseball fan doesn't like to argue about the all-times best players?), but he backs up his selections with cold hard facts. Statistics don't lie, they just get twisted around an awful lot. Or so it would seem. You can disagree with James' system (and I'm sure lots of folk have), but still it provides excellent food for thought. And it also shows how some players in certain seasons actually had much better seasons than it first appears, based on variables like the ballpark they played in, how well or poorly the team they played on did, whether the team was a &quot;power&quot; or &quot;base hit&quot; team and so on.<br />He also briefly discusses his Win Shares formula, which of course was the basis for another book. This formula in his view tends to show who may have been overrated or underrated during their career. Any time you put together a list of the all-time greats, you will always encounter the Hall of Famers like Williams, Ruth, Cobb, Mays, Aaron, Spahn, Young, Mathewson, and so on. But once you get past the &quot;upper echelon&quot; of players at each position, it becomes a little more difficult to decide who cracks the &quot;Top 100&quot; and who doesn't?<br />This is a book any baseball fan should have, not just because of the &quot;reams of stats&quot; in the book but because of the ideas James brings forth. And as someone else mentioned he does not hide his likes and dislikes (and I'm with James about reducing the number of relief pitchers in today's games!) in his essays. I've known about James for years, now I can say I have at least a casual knowledge of his &quot;system&quot; of rating players and teams.	2003-08-09

I was amazed and impressed by what I read. This anthology features essays by some of the most well-known authors in the leather community including Dorothy Allison, Geoff Mains, Mark Thompson, Guy Baldwin, Pat (now Patrick) Califia, Gayle Rubin, and Joseph Bean. The essays offer a &quot;glimpse&quot; into what &quot;is&quot; the leather community. Topics covered include leather history (from the 1940's through the 1990's, including an excellent essay on the Catacombs, a now legendary San Francisco male fisting and SM playspace), scene politics, spirituality, and numerous other topics about consensual power play.<br />As other reviewers have pointed out this book is not a &quot;how to guide,&quot; but it is of equal value to &quot;SM teaching manuals&quot; in that it gives the reader a &quot;feel&quot; of what this community is about. Those looking to get a better idea of what it is to be in the leather community should read this book, not just for the historical and/or sociological essays here, but just to get the sense (that this anthology conveys) of what the leather scene is about.	2003-08-01

It also details how fragmented its own community is, but then again this is true of all parts of the leather community; het, gay, bi, transgendered, and/or lesbian.<br />Filled with hot fiction, poetry, and some well-written non-fiction essays on various SM topics, I found this book to be informative and thought-provoking, even if it is now a bit dated. Of note too are the excellent essays on histories of various US women's groups featured in the book's last section. This is a book any leather community member with an interest in our past and present should read.	2003-08-01

Everything among standard records is here, along with time capsules of the period from the 1870s until now, and summaries of each season's World Series. For example, the National League originally wanted to vote in the DH back in the 1930's, but the American League didn't want it! There are enough records listed in this book to keep virtually all &quot;stat-heads&quot; happy. Records by position, obscure records, even a section on all-time minor league records, they're all here.<br />One minor flaw I noticed in the 2003 edition. Nemec doesn't always keep things completely updated. A mention of Gregg Jefferies, the ex-Met lists him as still active, even though he retired a couple seasons ago. Last season Shawn Green broke the single game total bases mark in an early season game, and yet Joe Adcock is still listed as the holder of that record.<br />Still, if you love baseball records you will love this book. It's full of those and quite a bit more.	2003-07-28

His words resonate with my philosophies about BDSM. As some of you know, he has a weekly email column called \\"Leather Views\\" and reading this book in some ways is like an extended version of one of his column. His writing is always entertaining and usually thought-provoking, as is this book.<br />Since this book applies to leather relationships, most chapters are devoted to topics relating to these kinds of relationships. From the beginning chapter on \\"leather vocabulary,\\" to the chapter called \\"Archetypes of SM relationships,\\" to chapters on \\"knowing yourself\\" and \\"knowing what you want\\" in a SM partner. And he devotes a separate chapter to looking for partners. There's a lot of advice he offers that a lot of us don't always follow but should. There are also chapters that discuss the pros and cons of monogamy versus polygamy, the concept of \\"clubs\\" and \\"leather families,\\" and relationship problems (he calls them \\"elephants in the room\\").<br />Jack offers his thoughts in a well thought out manner and raises points all of us in SM relationships should consider either before we enter into one or how to deal with issues once we are in one. An excellent book overall.	2003-06-20

This book offers a good look into what swinging is, from the stories told by couples \\"in the lifestyle,\\" to a single man's experiences, the pratfalls to look out for, as well as the joys of this experience. Every chapter of the book tells a different story. Some of the stories are quite delightful and erotic, and lead to the couples involved sharing numerous delights. A few others talk about the \\"dark side\\" of swinging, where swinging couples wind up with disastrous results, due to unrealistic expectations or realizations that either they or their partner are not really \\"into\\" this lifestyle. There's also advice on getting involved in this lifestyle if you so choose.<br />If you and/or your partner have ever considered swinging, this book offers some good information and advice.	2003-06-16

A team that virtually everyone counted out after the 2001 season came back to win over and over in 2002. Although I'm not an Oakland A's fan, I found myself grinning at the moves that Beane makes again and again to not only keep his team winning, but spend as little as possible in the process. Lose your three best players? No problem. Just reload with cheaper replacements. Lose more players after the season? No problem..cheaper replacements are on the way. The A's and other small market teams like the Twins who also are winning poke a huge hole in Bud Selig's contention that these \\"small market teams\\" should have been contracted just a year or two ago.<br />Another thing I noticed about this book is how Beane dispenses with the conventional wisdom of running a baseball team in favor of his own method. So far it obviously has worked, and worked well. And yet only two other major league teams as of the book's publishing have embraced this method. The other teams seem insistent on running a team as inefficiently as possible. All the better for Beane to continue to work his magic.<br />Numerous folk have commented in reviews of this book that it will be harder now for Beane to continue to be successful because this book shows how he has managed to do this. I don't think so, in fact I think in some ways he wants the rest of the world to know how he has done all this. He secretly wants recognition for the way he has managed to beat \\"the system.\\"<br />Not only a look at an unconventional way to run a baseball team, but this book is also a look at an unconventional way for anyone to successfully run any business. A fascinating read.	2003-06-11

All of them had good information. However, I felt this book covered the \\"basics\\" much better than other books I've read. From the book's beginning, where it tells you how to interpret your cards and how to handle them, through Part II (The Major Arcana), which contains chapters on Symbolic Interpretation & Astrological Correspondences of the Major Arcana, and using the Major Arcana as trump cards in a reading, to Part III (descriptions of the Minor Arcana in general, and descriptions of each suit), to Part IV (doing a reading), it contains a wealth of information. I especially liked the different meanings behind the Major Arcana cards, as well as the chapter on various card spreads (horseshoe, horoscope, seven-card spread, etc). Up until now, I mostly had only known of the Traditional Celtic Cross spread. It's nice to know there are others as well.<br />The book also contains brief descriptions of what each individual number card and court cards means. That is also helpful in doing a reading. It's obvious to me in reading this book that the author put a lot of work into writing it and is serious about the accuracy of the information contained within it. Well worth buying if you wish to learn more about The Tarot.<br />I do agree with other reviewers about the editing. It mars an otherwise excellent book.	2003-06-07

And Neyer in this book has taken what he feels to be the all-time best lineups for every current major league team, as well as teams that started in one location and moved elsewhere (like the Boston/Milwaukee/Atlanta Braves, Brooklyn/LA Dodgers, NY/SF Giants, Wash Senators/Texas Rangers, etc.). While you may not always agree with his choices, Neyer in my opinion has done a wonderful job with these \\"lineups.\\" He also has a lineup of 'best individual seasons,' a gold glove team and an \\"iron glove\\" team (for worst fielders), his \\"all-bust\\" teams, rookie teams, traded away teams, and his \\"used to be great\\" teams. Having followed baseball since the late 1960s, I vividly remember many of the names in this book, as well as knowing numerous others whose names appear here. Some of the associated vignettes with each team are also fascinating. Like the story of David Clyde, the 18-year-old pitcher for the 1973 Rangers, or \\"Generation K\\" of the 1995 Mets. Or how the Devil Rays' management philosophy in Neyer's opinion has contributed to them having some terrible teams. Or how the famous line about the late, lamented Washington Senators, \\"first in war, first in peace, and last in the American League\\" really isn't all that true.<br />Neyer gives a lot of credit where credit is due. His \\"iron glove\\" teams are at times a hoot. Neyer mentions the infamous Johnie LeMaster of the Giants at shortstop on their \\"iron glove\\" team, Jose Offerman his counterpart for the Dodgers, Eddie Matthews at first base for the 1967 Astros, and so on. His all-rookie teams include notables like Mark McGwire for the '87 A's (well doh) and Stan Musial for the 1942 Cardinals. For some long-time teams, he lists 2 greatest lineups. At the end of the book is a section that features each team and its starting lineup from year to year, along with their manager.<br />Any fan, whether they be casual followers or students of the game are going to love this book! It's a good one.the game are going to love this book! It's a good one.	2003-05-23

While it definitely is not a \\"how to write technical manuals\\" type of book, the topics and material covered make it well worth having on any writer's bookshelf. And in this latest edition, not only have the editors done another great job, the book's page layout is wonderful. In previous editions, all text and type was in black. In this edition, headings, paragraph titles and diagrams are framed in blue. This seemingly minor change makes the book's material easier to read and refer to.<br />The book continues to have extensive information about writing-related topics. Everything from proper grammar, to writing reports, to interviewing subject matter experts, how to do Internet research for a writing project, writing newsletters and/or abstracts, interviewing for a job and interviewing a subject matter expert for more information about a subject, writing proposals, and so forth is covered in this book. There's even a companion web site to the book that provides links to online resources for further information.<br />The book's preface contains what the editors consider their \\"Five Steps to Successful Writing,\\" and also a \\"Checklist of the Writing Process,\\" complete with subsections containing listings for (in order) Preparation, Research, Organization, Writing a Draft, and Revision. In fact, a few of the book's numerous entries contain their own \\"writer's checklist\\" of things to do. Some subjects have not only a heading, but cross-references to other pages of related topics. For example, if I was interested in learning how to write a proposal, I could go to that listing, and also find reference information on internal and external proposals. There seems to be at times an endless wealth of information about whatever writing topic you are looking for. This book's main strength obviously is how all the book's material is organized.<br />This is one book every writer should have. Even though it isn't a \\"how-to-write\\" book, it's still a \\"tools for writing\\" book. I find myself referring to it often when I'm<br />working on any kind of writing project.<br />As with past editions, the book's editors have done a wonderful job with this handbook.write\\" book, it's still a \\"tools for writing\\" book.

How each person astral travels can be different, but I found the author's &quot;guide&quot; to astral travel to be quite good. She describes numerous &quot;general topics&quot; about astral travel, including the astral plane, time travel, healing and magick in the astral plane, and contacting spiritual teachers and guides. She gives guided meditation examples for each of these topics. I found her section on &quot;travelling&quot; to Atlantis intriguing for example. She also describes the types of entities you will find while travelling. While most are &quot;good&quot; and &quot;helpful,&quot; there are &quot;dark entities,&quot; which are found on the lower astral levels. She discusses ways of avoiding them and also spends an entire chapter discussing &quot;astral defense,&quot; which is ways not only to avoid these &quot;bad entities,&quot; but also ways to protect yourself if you sense you are under some form of &quot;attack&quot; while on the astral plane.<br />While I greatly enjoyed this book, I'm in agreement with another reviewer who suggests reading other books on this topic. It's one that cannot be covered in one single book. However, this one is an excellent place to start.	2003-05-11

I first came across this book in a local book store and would rush over there to look up an animal I saw and its meaning every time I saw a new totems. I finally broke down and bought the book and consider it money well spent. It's nice to have it to refer to when a new totem appears before me. But besides being a very comprehensive dictionary of totems, there's also the philosophy behind them and how man needs to work more with nature to truly understand its power in our lives.<br />I've come to be aware of and am thankful for the totems in my life that are helping me through my life's journeys. I feel this book would be very helpful to those (who don't already have it) that are interested in learning more about how animals speak to us, both symbolically and in nature, as well as shamanism and Native American culture. One recent morning I dreamt about a racoon that rushed by me and then that night saw one running through my back yard. His expression seemed to indicate he had something to tell me. Without having read this book, I might have shrugged it off but it to me is a perfect example of what animals can teach us. The message? Most likely to be a little more guarded in my dealings with others.<br />I liked too how the author compared the \\"country\\" with the city, pointing out that even in a city environment you can still find parts of nature around us. It truly is everywhere, whether we acknowledge it or not.	2003-04-23

Having known a couple women who did this type of work at one time, it gave me a better idea of what kinds of clients they get along with their fantasies, which run the gamut from good old fashioned  to BDSM to the unusual. The men the author deals with also range from \\"nice guys\\" to those trying to get away with a \\"free call\\" to those with disturbing fantasies, and even \\"first timer callers.\\" Quite a fascinating cross-section of folk.<br />The author also has chapters on role playing for lovers wanting to try their own form of this play and if you want to try it, tips on what to do and what not to do. I liked how the author pointed out that phone sex is sex, even if it may not be the \\"traditional\\" form we all love. And as the author points out, it is the ultimate in safe play.<br />This book offers a fascinating look into this fascinating \\"world,\\" and those who are \\"phone sex operators\\" and their clients.	2003-04-23

It provides lots of good information and thoughtful points. I've been into SM for over a decade, yet there were still items in this book I hadn't thought of or considered before reading it.<br />The authors speak of \\"ritual\\" in SM. Very good point and the longer I do this sort of thing, the more I agree with them on this point. In fact, they devote a whole chapter to \\"spiritual SM,\\" describing ways to incorporate ritual into your scene. They also talk about \\"shadow play,\\" ie ways to do scenes with major emotional risk, both ways to do them and how to end them safely, and what to do if something goes wrong.<br />In fact early on in the book, Janet and Dossie discuss what to do when something goes wrong, and how to handle this, whether it's during the scene, right after, or even a day or several days later. This also goes for after care, for even when a scene goes great, one or both participants may want or need this.<br />Among other topics mentioned? As in the original edition, chapters feature topics like \\"What Is It About Topping Anyway\\" (ie 'why the attraction to it'), Rights and Responsibilities of a Top, Learning to Play, Ethics, even where and how to meet others (always of importance).<br />The end of the book has a short \\"resource guide\\" of books, support groups, even a couple of online resources for the reader to learn more. It's nice to see an update for this classic. Excellent job you two!	2003-04-14

It came out around the same time I began exploring Paganism as a spiritual path. Since I already casually knew a couple of people the book interviews (Carol Queen &amp; Joi Wolfwomyn) before reading this book, it was interesting for me to read what they had to say about this spiritual path. I also found out about Madrone's workshops as a result of this book. As I read more of the interviews, I found myself agreeing with some but not necessarily everything I read. Which is fine, not everything I read I will agree with, just as not everything I say others will agree with. And while this book is an excellent cross-section of those following this path, not every path is represented. Still it does provide some good viewpoints and food for thought.<br />The book also features a lot of other books and web sites to read for those looking for further information. There are also other side bars featuring items like a feature about the &quot;history of Gardnerian wicca,&quot; a sample ritual, and numerous pictures. To someone either considering exploring or following this path, this book provides a glimpse into what some but not all Pagans do in their day to day lives and what this path means to them personally.	2003-04-05

Among the hacks listed in Chapter 1 include &quot;getting around Google's 10 Word Search Limit,&quot; Mixing Syntaxes, Date-Range Searching, Using Full-Word Wildcards, Tracking Stocks, and searching article archives. Perfect for &quot;non-geeky types like me. But wait, there's much more! Chapter 2 discusses Google's Special Services and Collections, like the Google Directory, newsgroups and images. There's a chapter explaining the Google Web API and another chapter listing hacks for Google Web API programs. Chapter 7 lists a few hacks (ie. &quot;pranks&quot;) you can pull on your friends if you're in a playful mood.<br />The authors have put the usual excellent and thorough job into this book that I've known to love and appreciate about all O'Reilly books. Not only do they take the time to thoroughly explain Google and topics related to Google, they also with a number of hacks show code examples, making it easy to implement them.<br />Hacks (and hackers, not crackers) in recent times have gotten a bad name as another reviewer pointed out. The 100 hacks this book lists are ones that are of benefit to all who use Google as their primary search engine.	2003-03-21

When I heard about this book, I realized that it would probably be an excellent one for me to read. I was right. The authors take the time to explain a lot of different &quot;psychic-related&quot; topics, but they do so in a straightforward way, and they do not go off on any type of &quot;new age tangent.&quot; One thing they talk about is energy. The more books I read about the &quot;spirit world,&quot; the more I realize energy is the basis for their and our human existence. The authors throughout the book use numerous different exercises to help the reader tune in to various psychic skills. In some ways, it's almost &quot;interactive.&quot; Some of the exercises are meditations of one kind or another. I've come to realize that meditations and energy seem to go hand in hand in doing any type of &quot;psychic work.&quot;<br />The book also contains numerous stories about spirit contact, as well as numerous drawings done by one of the authors of spirits on &quot;the other side.&quot; I found these stories and drawings to be fascinating and for me further proof that spirits do indeed exist. It makes me wonder what spirits I have &quot;behind the scenes&quot; guiding my life.<br />I'm thankful a book like this is now available because it answered some questions for me about the spirit realm. The back of the book contains further resources, which is good because while this book answered many questions for me, it's provided me with further questions and the motivation to learn more.	2003-03-17

Also, the descriptions of the various chakras are excellent. I had no idea for example that we all have hand and feet chakras, as well as four chakras above and below us. I also discovered each person's aura is quite complex with several different layers that correspond to each chakra.<br />The book's first chapter starts off not surprisingly with grounding exercises, running earth and cosmic energy. Always good to start with basics. The next chapter discusses the various chakras. Subsequent chapters discuss topics like distinguishing your energy from others, cords and how to &quot;dissolve&quot; them, &quot;screens,&quot; aura layers and repairing them if needed.<br />I found the book along with all the various exercises, to be fascinating and plan to refer to it often in the future as I expand my psychic awareness.	2003-03-10

From the book's beginning that gives a brief \\"history\\", to your \\"book of shadows\\", spell-writing, to numerous \\"Craft topics\\" that not only describe them briefly but also the minerals, herbs, candles, colors, numbers, etc that can be used for each of them, this book is an excellent reference book. I've been practicing Wicca for a little over a year now and I found this book to have a lot of good information.<br />The book is also concise enough to have a lot of this information readily at hand without it taking up a huge amount of pages. While the book does have some spells in it, it also cautions the reader to be careful when using some (the old adage \\"be careful what you wish for\\" comes to mind) if not all of them. I specifically liked her brief sections on psychic work and creativity and her section on Animal Magic. But that's just me, there's enough reference information here to make this book one that ought to be on every Wiccan's bookshelf.	2003-03-03

I found it a very interesting read. Not only does Van Praagh discuss several stories of various clients, but also offers advice on several areas for those of us wishing to develop and expand our psychic abilities. While we all have them, some of us may have more developed abilities than others. However, that doesn't mean we all can't try to develop them the best way we can.<br />In one chapter he discusses auras, their colors and layers, and \\"defects.\\" I never had any ideas auras were so complex. He also talks about spirit signals and guides and makes an important point about \\"living guides,\\" people in our lives who may be friends that are also here to guide us through our life or to guide us part of the way. There's also an excellent chapter about psychic protection, things like \\"psychic vampires\\" or other harmful energies that may drain us, causing us to become irritable or depressed or tired. While these symptoms are most definitely NOT always or even some of the time caused by so-called \\"psychic vampires,\\" it does make you stop and consider whether or not you know people in your life who may be sapping your energy. His chapter called \\"Miracles Every Day\\" makes you consider how you can change your life for the better and get rid of unwanted habits or fears. Pointing out that the universe does give you what you ask for, it brings to mind the old saying, \\"Don't ask too hard for what you want, you just might get it.\\"<br />There are also sections in the book about meditation exercises, cleansing and strengthening your aura, and protecting yourself from negative thoughts and emotions. Like a fellow reviewer before me, this book has inspired me to continue to further develop my psychic abilities.	2003-02-26

Joseph has put a lot of love and effort into these cards. And not only are they beautiful, they are a kind of &quot;universal divination tool.&quot; Not only do you have the traditional cards, including the Major and Minor Arcanas, but also on the cards are either rune symbols, I Ching symbols, astrological signs, and gemstones. The cards have a number of unusual features, such as foretelling time lines and the ability to answer Yes/No questions.<br />There's also a short section in the book called Tarot Party Games. Can you imagine &quot;Tarot Poker?&quot; Hmmm makes me wonder what happens when you get a full house in your spread. Another section I liked was in the book's beginning where it discusses how to take care of your cards, a nice touch.<br />And of course the book describes each card of the Major and Minor Arcanas. There's also a blank card, called the Mysterious Blank Card which you can use as your Significator card or as your own &quot;custom card.&quot; The Major Arcana also has two &quot;zero cards,&quot; The Fool and the Multiuniverse.&quot; Very nice.<br />I really like how Joseph has kept with tradition in designing this set, but added a few extra touches that make this deck really stand out. I have looked at numerous Tarot decks and not felt anything, but as soon as I saw this deck, I felt an immediate and positive emotional reaction to them.	2003-02-24

While I didn't take all the steps listed here at that time, the next time they happen I'll be much better prepared thanks to Mr. Luber.<br />Among the topics Luber talks about here are the &quot;must&quot; applications you should have including an anti-virus program (Luber recommends Norton Anti-Virus), a firewall (Zone Alarm is the one Luber recommends), and also some kind of data scrubber (a program designed to erase beyond recovery any old date), along with several other optional recommendations. I learned quite a lot reading this book about what I should and/or shouldn't do with regards to protecting my computer from another potential disaster. And Luber points out that a disaster is always not very far away with computer systems that have at best an &quot;unstable equilibrium.&quot;<br />Luber also describes the steps to take when buying a new PC, two chapters are devoted to that. While I'm very happy with the system I have and the support I get from the merchants I bought it from, the tips Luber offers are quite helpful. Luber also describes how to do data backups, pointing out that if you have all your important files backed up, you can recover from a hard drive failure quickly.<br />Luber also points out not all &quot;disasters&quot; really are disasters if you know how to fix a problem quickly. Not only is the book helpful, Luber has a companion web site to go along with the book.<br />I found this to be an excellent and informative book about a topic that leaves most computer users like me fearful and ready to call my techie friend when I run into computer problems.

For people like me who felt incredible loss and grief that day, it was to me a message that they too wanted to let everyone know they are fine.<br />Like \\"one Last Time,\\" he has stories about contacts with \\"the other side,\\" some of which will bring tears to your eyes. To some this book has and will bring comfort in the knowledge that \\"Yes Virginia, there is The Other Side.\\"<br />Books like this one prove not only there is a spiritual realm, but give comfort in knowing your departed ones are still around and want to try and contact us, even if we can't physically see them.	2003-02-20

However being a computer professional, I have an interest in the topic of network security, and how crackers and &quot;script kiddies&quot; infiltrate network systems. This book offers a wealth of network security information that even &quot;novices&quot; like myself can easily follow. And in some of the examples Cole discusses, it's almost scary to discover how easy it is for someone with even a little bit of knowledge to infiltrate a computer network. Cole's book while dauntingly large contains a wealth of information that any security professional should know about. One of my sys admin friends was commenting to me that books like Cole's allow the &quot;script kiddies&quot; to learn about exploits without doing any of the work that a &quot;black hat (cracker)&quot; or &quot;white hat (hacker)&quot; might do to exploit a system. However big a risk that may possibly be, I still feel it's best for any security professional to be informed about all the various types of exploits they may deal with. And with a book of this size, there are obviously lots of them to discuss.<br />Cole discusses exploits against Linux, UNIX, Windows, and Windows NT and the myriad of programs (password crackers, network sniffers, back door programs, etc.) designed to break into other people's systems. Each program is described in full and what it does.

It would take me too long to search for it in the Word help files. With this pocket guide, I no longer need to worry about it as I can flip through this book to find what I need. This is easy to do since the book is divided into four main parts. Part 1 is about the &quot;main parts&quot; of Word: template and document files, shortcut menus, etc. Part 2 devotes itself to &quot;Word tasks,&quot; like inserting and editing text, formatting paragraphs and creating lists, inserting objects, working with tables, and so forth. Part 3 is a &quot;command reference,&quot; with numerous tables devoted to specific commands. This feature makes it easy to search for a specific command. Part 4 lists online Word resources and other related books.<br />This pocket guide is truly a &quot;quick and dirty way&quot; to find a command to do a specific Word task that otherwise might take hours to find using conventional Word help or large Word reference guides.	2002-12-20

Also included is information about the different kinds of stars out there (everything from &quot;white dwarves&quot; to &quot;red giants&quot;), how the universe was created and how many other potential universe there are &quot;out there.&quot; Particularly interesting to me were the descriptions of the various planets and also how &quot;black holes&quot; get formed.<br />The book's appendices also contain a wealth of information, a list of upcoming solar and lunar eclipses, a list of constellations, and other sources of information. Anyone with an interest in astronomy, be it an &quot;amateur astronomer&quot; setting up his telescope to search the skies or a lay person like me who wonders what other worlds are like will enjoy this book.	2002-12-17

While this book might be considered primarily for \\"SM beginners,\\" there's still a good amount of information and ideas for anyone looking to spice up their love life. John has written fourteen stories based around various \\"scenes,\\" ranging from spanking, wax play, a staged kidnapping, to enemas and humiliation play. At the beginning of each story, John gives a list of items needed to stage the scene, as well as safety information about each scene in notes on the side of the main text in each story. In fact, there is some additional safety information listed at the book's end.<br />This book might be considered a kind of \\"BDSM lite book\\" and makes a good companion to other SM books like SM 101, Screw the Roses, and Sensual Magic.	2002-12-06

I first got it 4 years ago, enjoyed it quite a bit and later discovered it had gone out of print. This collection of 69 (yes, 69!) short stories is erotic, fun, spontaneous, and never dull. Anyone reading it will get some great ideas about new ways to use those previously \\"dull\\" household items. From ace bandages to wooden spoons to feather dusters to hairbrushes, these stories feature some very imaginative and creative folk finding new ways to have adult fun.<br />This book will not ever take the place of a good book on erotic power play like SM 101 or Screw the Roses (which I recommend to anyone new to BDSM), but still is an entertaining and sexy read.	2002-12-04

What I had forgotten of course besides the wonderful stories were the stories of the gods and goddesses themselves, along with the cultures that spawned these stories. And each culture reflects the mood of the stories. Greece and Rome had stories that at times could be harsh, but could also be fun and cheerful. Norse myths on the other hand definitely had a dark tone to most of them. The book also touches on other myths, including the epic battle of Beowulf versus Grendel, King Arthur and Camelot, and other cultures' myths (among them Egyptian, Indian, Chinese and Japanese, and also Latin America)<br />What this book does besides describing various gods, goddesses and heroes of each culture, is to also discuss each culture's societies, be them Greek, Roman, Egyptian, etc. I liked refreshing my mind about Greek and Roman deities, but also learning about the deities of numerous other countries that I'd never had the chance to read about before.<br />This book brought back memories of myths I studied long ago, as well as learning about other cultures and their myths that I never knew existed.	2002-11-30

If you're the kind of person that loves to pull naughty tricks on web visitors, you will love this book. Or if you just want to know some cool stuff to try just for the heck of it, you will love this book. While some of this tricks have no value other than to annoy, it's nice to know about them if you do any kind of web design. And for the ones that do have some value, it's nice to know of some new tricks to try (as long as they're not overdone). I'm always looking for the latest \\"tricks\\" and when I got this book, I thought it would be more of a \\"guide to what not to do with a web site.\\" Instead, the author seems to take great pleasure out of pointing out \\"evil tricks\\" to try.<br />Among them? Bothersome Backgrounds, like flashing backgrounds or a scrolling background. Nasty looking text that fades in or out, or changes colors constantly. Links that go nowhere or adding sounds to them. Crazy cursors that change shape or disappear entirely. Popups or windows that fill up a whole screen. Or even ways to \\"force\\" visitors to fill out a form within a specified time or to block underage visitors if you have an adult-oriented site (actually that one might come in handy for some!).<br />At times hilarious and a quick read, this book is enjoyable especially if you have a perverse desire to learn what the annoying things you really shouldn't do with a web site, but have the desire to do anyway.	2002-11-26

The games were always entertaining and top notch. You could tell Phelps was excellent at getting the most from his teams. This book is a continuation of that, he combines his knowledge and occasionally humor to write an excellent guide about the sport. In an early chapter, he points out that you can play the game almost anywhere and equipment costs are low. Who wouldn't enjoy it? In later chapters, he discusses rules, stats, shooting fundamentals and offense, defense and rebounding, specific plays run during games, the various levels of play (from pickup games up to the pros and international basketball), as well as chapters on coaching and getting into &quot;playing shape.&quot; He even lists his choices for &quot;Ten Greatest Games&quot; and &quot;Ten (well eleven) Greatest Players.&quot; The book even contains a glossary of terms and drills to use in practices.<br />Truly a complete &quot;instructional guide&quot; to basketball (if there ever was such a thing).	2002-11-20

A man who played with Jackie Robunson, Pee Wee Reese, and several other famous Brooklyn Dodgers, who while managing the Red Sox had a pitcher who called him a &quot;gerbil,&quot; and dealt with a &quot;clueless owner&quot; while managing the Rangers, and who was fortunate enough to be part of the Yankees' late 90s dynasty. And the stories he tells in this book are ones worthy of a man who has been in baseball over 50 years. His times with the Dodgers, his reign as manager of the perenially hopeless Chicago Cubs, his times as bench coach with the Yankees. And yet he has a kind word for virtually everyone he has either played with or against, or managed or coached, with the exception of Bill Lee. It's apparent the two did not get along, then again I'm not sure how I'd handle being called a &quot;gerbil&quot; either.<br />This book shows &quot;Zim&quot; to be a delight both on and off the baseball field and a man who has seen virtually everything in his baseball life.	2002-11-06

How many of us as baseball fans secretly wish we could do just that?  How many of us however actually have the time and more importantly the finances to do this?<br />While the book is dated, it still is well worth a read. The author describes the dreams of numerous minor league ballplayers to make it to &quot;the Show,&quot; but points out only one out of every fourteen actually makes it to the big leagues. And not only is this book about their stories, but the stories of numerous minor league towns, and the people the author encounters. He also gets to meet and talk with several of his boyhood idols, players from the 1957 Milwaukee Braves. Some of the stories of these people are sad, some hilarious, but all of them are quite entertaining. I've recommended this book to a friend with a son who aspires to be a &quot;big leaguer&quot; someday, because it entails some of the hardships involved in getting there. This book is a travelogue of places where time has seemingly stood still and the players are gods, even if they are only minor leaguers pursuiing a dream.	2002-09-12

And yet very few really know who was the \\"father of television?\\" I certainly didn't until I read this book. None other than Philo T Farnsworth was the man who at age 14 first thought up the ideas in a sketch that would later lead to the invention of the \\"boob tube\\" we know and love today. This book (a project some 25 years in the making as the author describes it), describes Philo's struggles with bringing his invention to fruition, his battles with RCA over patents relating to his invention, and his lack of deserved recognition, and later his frustrating attempts to harness fusion energy as a source of electrical power.<br />One thing I wondered about as I read the book was how many other inventors through time have faced the same struggles that Philo did, and how some of them dealt with that struggle. I can only imagine the stress and strain Philo went through and what he might think of how his invention is being used today, some 75 years after his first experiments.<br />Hopefully this book will help in recognizing the man who invented an appliance we all take for granted in today's world.	2002-09-10

His latest book takes a different approach, not a reference book but more one that takes information about CSS and applies it here to real life examples, which makes it much easier for the average CSS author to learn and see how the CSS styles shown relate to what is being done on the site it affects. The book consists of 13 chapters or &quot;projects,&quot; ranging from converting an existing page to CSS, to styling a press release or events calendar, to even creating your own online greeting card. There's a companion web site, which lets you download the files to be used with each project.<br />The book is wonderfully laid-out with lots of gorgeous color drawings and figures, which aid the reader in understanding each change. The step by step instructions are easy to follow and with each CSS code change or addition shown in red, also easy to understand and follow along with. I was amazed at the wide range of effects that can be done using CSS, as shown with each project.<br />This book is an excellent &quot;tutorial&quot; for those wishing to learn more about CSS.	2002-09-04

There are also breif descriptions of Negro league ballparks, some minor league parks of note, as well as the \\"behind the scenes\\" people and places that make baseball stadiums the stuff of legends. Pages about PA Announcers, team mascots, scoreboards and billboard ads in stadiums are also included here. The book starts off with a history of stadiums, from the wooden edifices of the late 19th century to the \\"retro ballparks\\" of today.<br />Reading through this book, you get a real feel for what each stadium is like, and what it feels like to experience watching a ballgame there.

I liked the author's examples of doing Celtic Cross spreads, it helped make the concept of the spread more interesting and meaningful for me.<br />I liked too his explanations of the Major Arcana cards, starting with the brief descriptions at the beginning of Chapter Four. Throughout the rest of the book, the author describes the &quot;meaning&quot; of each card, including &quot;key words,&quot; &quot;advice&quot; and what the &quot;reversed meaning&quot; meant. There are also brief synopses of each of the minor arcana (Wands, Pentacles, Swords, and Aces) along with individual descriptions of each card.<br />I have just recently developed an interest in Tarot and this book has helped answer many questions I had.	2002-08-18

Others for whatever reasons never made it that far, and spent most of their careers playing for various Texas League teams. Their stories and the stories of so many teams are described here. O'Neal does his usual excellent job chronicling the history of the league, all of its teams, cities, and ballparks. As with all his other minor league history books, the back of the book lists league records, ranging from year to year standings, post season and All-Star game results, and yearly individual batting and pitching leaders.

This book helps to make web searches much less time-consuming and more efficient. One thing I learned early on in this book is that &quot;not all search egnines are created equal,&quot; that some engines are better suited to specific searches than others.<br />I also liked the chapter of the book that discussed &quot;The Seven Habits of Highly Effective Web searchers.&quot; Among them being to &quot;use the best tool for the job&quot; (the best search engine for your specific search as there as numerous specific search engiens available), choosing unique keywords, and to use multiple search engines (to increase your chances of finding what you want, especially if your search involves a seemingly obscure topic). Sometimes &quot;metasearch engines&quot; can be helpful as well.<br />The book concentrates on what it considers the &quot;Big Six Search Engines:&quot; AltaVista, Google, HotBot, Lycos, Northern Light, and Yahoo. Each of these engines have specific chapters devoted to them which explain in step by step instructions how to do a basic search and advanced search to narrow your specific search. There are also &quot;quick-reference tables&quot; for basic and advanced searches for each of these engines.<br />Subsequent chapters touch upon other search engines, like Excite, Nestcape Search, and &quot;specialized engines, like Deja (now owned by Google), Topica, and a Business search engine called Zip2. The last chapter discusses still more specialized search engines. I never knew so many of them existed!<br />A very informative book for anyone who &quot;surfs the Web&quot; looking for specific information.	2002-08-01

And there's a lot that this book covers. One main thing I did learn was that I need to explore doing meditation. There are a number of meditation exercises listed in this book. There are also numerous anecdotes throughout the book to prove that there is indeed such a thing as &quot;psychic phenomena.&quot;<br />Starting off with determining whether or not you or indeed psychic, a &quot;history&quot; of pyschic-related events through the ages, and what science has to say about psychic phenomena, this book's goal is to inform, not preach and offer some good advice about expanding your psychic awareness, which it does in the second part of the book. Chapters about receiving information, opening up to, and &quot;tuning in&quot; to your awareness are feautred here. There are also later on in the book chapters about psychic healing, hypnosis, telepathy, precognition, channeling messages from &quot;beyond our world,&quot; even some &quot;tools of the trade.&quot;<br />There's nothing &quot;new agey&quot; about this book, it presents information in a clear and straightforward manner and one that is easy for everyone to understand.	2002-07-23

I loved this book because it explains virtually every aspect of Paganism. The explanations and descriptions of various Pagan practices, ideals, Sabbats, rituals are kept brief as befits an introductory book. And yet, even after having a handful of other intoductory Pagan books, I found myself learning facts here that I hadn't known about before. The author sticks to the \\"Pagan philosophy\\" of \\"Harm no one\\" in describing Paganism.<br />Among topics discussed? Besides the various Pagan Sabbats and pagan ideals, there are chapters devoted to Shamans, Druids, Wicca, the \\"Spirit World\\" and the Pagan elements of fire, air, water, and earth. There are four chapters that discuss Pagan rituals and I found the author's claim that we already do rituals in our lives (high school and college graduation, marriage and funerals, for example) very true. I never would have thought about that. There's also several chapters devoted to \\"Pagan magic,\\" which help to demystify it. The book's last few chapters offer advice on \\"living the Pagan lifestyle,\\" and there's an extensive list of recommended reading at the book's end. One could spend months reading through the list of books alone if one wanted to.<br />The more I read about Paganism, the more I realize other religions over the centuries have liberally borrowed its customs and holidays. For anyone wishing to join this path or those already on it seeking to learn more, this book is a wonderful introduction.	2002-07-10

But seriously, this book contains literally a ton (well ok maybe more like 75 or 80) ideas for dates. And they are for the most part &quot;alternative&quot; ideas and not ones like the dreaded &quot;movie&quot; or &quot;dinner&quot; date. Things like live theater, train rides, planetarium or factory tours, film festivals, bird watching, etc.<br />Not only are the ideas mentioned, but also background information about them. For example, the author lists playing pool as a date idea and then lists the different types of pool games there are. I never knew that. This is one book that I know I can refer to the next time I meet some nice lady and want to do something other than a movie.<br />Now it's just a matter of finding nice women to go out with!	2002-07-07

He has crafted a wonderful history of how Top 40 began, features on numerous radio personalities (among them Tom Donahue, B Mitch Reed, Robert W Morgan, The Real Don Steele, Alan Freed, Dick Biondi, the list goes on and on). And the CD included with the book featuring airchecks of some of these amazing personalities is wild. Hearing DJ's like Gary Owens, B Mitch Reed, Casey Kasem or Tom Donahue in their early days is a hoot.<br />If the book has a West Coast slant on personalities, perhaps that's only because Torres grew up in the Bay Area. However, he does not give short shrift to anyone. He also goes into great detail about the people who helped create this format: Chuck Blore of \\"Color Radio\\" fame, Bill Drake and Ron Jacobs of \\"Boss Radio\\" fame, Gordon McLendon and Tod Storz, among others. It's ironic in a way that Torres' claim to fame came later as first a journalist for Rolling Stone and as a DJ on KSAN in San Francisco (one of those \\"underground\\" FM stations that loved to poke fun at the Top 40 stations).<br />The book traces the beginnings, development, and \\"growing pains\\" of this format. How at one time it was hip, then became \\"square\\" when the underground FM stations hit the airwaves, and how it now seems to have emerged again. And funny how the underground stations developed as a kind of \\"antidote\\" to very restrictive Top 40 formats, just as the Top 40 stations developed as something different to the standard fare of that time.<br />Amazing stories abound in this book, and being an ex DJ myself I could relate to them. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I agree with another reviewer that this book is must reading for any past or present DJ, or any student of the media.	2002-06-30

Examples of SAN's in use are also provided. Each chapter describes a various facet of SAN's and lists specific products at the end of each chapter. Another useful feature of this book is its \\"referrals\\" to specific terms and their descriptions in other parts of the book.<br />The first chapter provides an introduction to the concept of SAN's and the factors to be considered for a data storage system, along with brief descriptions of Network Attached Storage (NAS) and SAN's. The next chapter describes the various \\"components\\" of a SAN, including SAN \\"fabrics\\" and servers. There's also a detailed description of Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disk Drives (RAID), which is an important aspect of any kind of data storage. Subsequent chapters decribe topics like interfaces, network interconnects (like modems, routers, and switches), fibre channels, designing and implementing your own SAN and what factors you should consider before doing this, and finally managing your SAN and what the future holds for them.<br />All in all, some excellent information is provided here for those considering whether or not to start a SAN, if they haven't done so already.	2002-06-26

I like this book!	I'm not a big fan of Tim McCarver, the TV analyst. So when I've seen this book I didn't give it much of a glance until just recently. I leafed through a few pages and became intrigued. I read a few more and was hooked. He does a wonderful job explaining the &quot;intricacies&quot; of the game. McCarver takes a kind of 'scientific' approach in explaining the various parts of the game, from the preparation he goes through before a televised game, to the pre-game meetings, to the actual game itself, &quot;working a lineup,&quot; what is involved in playing the various positions, pitcher-batter duels, and so on. He also talks about what is going on with each pitch and how everyone, batter, pitcher, catcher and all the other players react to various pitch counts.<br />Since I've read the book, I've tried to be more conscious of what goes on during a game, checking to see if I can tell what signals a first or third base coach is giving, what kind of signs a catcher is giving a pitcher, or the other various strategies going on within a game. These &quot;games within the game&quot; have made watching baseball more fun. I may still at times get aggravated with McCarver's analysis during a game, but this book has made me a more knowledgeable fan.	2002-06-24

It also offers some instructions on basic drumming rhythms, including a CD that contains samples of the basic drum rhythms Helm talks about.<br />As with his other book, there lots of stories. For example, the one about the old Marvin Gaye song &quot;Inner City Blues,&quot; and the interesting drum rhythm used on that song. It's a song I've always enjoyed for its lyrics and now one I can enjoy for its unusual drum rhythm as well.<br />Helm also stresses the point throughout the book that it's &quot;finding your own groove&quot; that's important. As he puts it, so many feel the need to &quot;bang hard&quot; on the drum, or &quot;fill every possible space with notes,&quot; when at times the exact opposite is what works best. The temptation of course is there to play hard and fill every note (and most likely drive the drummers around you nuts) in a drumming circle.<br />I found myself nodding in agreement with almost all of what Helm had to say and found the book uplifting and entertaining.	2002-05-10

This was something that appealed to me and I knew I needed to get my own drum. I found a beautiful djembe and began playing in a handful of different drumming circles. However, at one of them I found myself getting frustrated because I was unable to keep up the rhythm. It was not too long after that I came across this book. Perfect, I thought..a book about drumming by a drummer himself!<br />And in it, Helm talks not about the techniques of drumming, but more about the reasons why we drum, and the philosophies behind it. Why it is better to play soft, leave notes out, then it is to &quot;bang on the drum all day,&quot; as Todd Rundgren would say. Helm makes so many great points in this book and I found myself very much in agreement with his philosophy, and of pointing out that we all have rhythm inside each of us, and that we need to let that spirit come out and be joyful.<br />At a time when I was beginning to doubt whether drumming was something I could enjoy, this book reinforced the enthusiasm I felt the first time when I hit a drum. I now have a much better idea and philosophy about drumming. Thanks Russell!	2002-05-08

Whether it's the dog that gets a little \\"too territorial\\" toward you, dealing with the authorities in the event of a noise complaint when you and your partner are doing SM, having your kids walk in on you while you're having sex or walking in on him or her having sex, or dealing with an emotionally unstable person you've brought home to \\"play\\" with, it gives good advice and solutions on how to deal with the issue at hand.<br />I really liked the section on shaving your or your partners genitals, and most importantly (for we men), a section about menstruation. Damn I could have used this book 20 years ago! This book may not be the greatest alterntive lifestyle book in the history of mankind, but it still is very handy to have around, because one never knows when a \\"sex disaster\\" will strike.	2002-05-04

This book is no exception. While the dictionary of Celtic Gods and Goddesses, Hereos and Heroines which takes up most of the book can be a bit daunting to a newcomer like me, I have to also admit it's probably the most extensive one I've seen. Another reviewer pointed out that while McCoy points out the care that should be used in invoking certain deities, but does not go into greater detail, I too agree that the practioner should use care and caution when working with them (but isn't that true of doing any task?).<br />I like too that this book explains in detail various rituals of evocation (house protection spell, money spell, etc.) and invocation (healing spell, eco-magick, for example), the numerous Sabbats (I had yet to learn before reading this book for example that Samhain is considered the beginning of the \\"New Year,\\" not Yule), and Pagan Life Cycle events.<br />This is a wonderful book for anyone like me who wishes to explore Celtic Paganism.	2002-04-25

Not only do they each have their own thoughts on how they write their stories, and what &quot;works&quot; for them and what doesn't, you get some idea of what they're like as people. I have written my own erotica for years but am finding out especially after reading books like this that I may have a bit of a ways to go to match the work these authors have done.<br />Writers, at least the good ones can really be thought of as &quot;word magicians&quot; in how they can turn a phrase, how they develop their characters and their stories, making them not only entertaining but hot as well. The stories collected here (each author's personal favorite (s)he has written), as well as each author's essay are informative and highly entertaining.	2002-04-06

It starts off by giving a short story of the company's current status. And since this book is almost a year old now, of course it's a bit dated. This book came out before the economy took a nosedive, taking Cisco along with every other company. I'd be intrigued to see what the author would have to say about Cisco now. Even so, Cisco appears to have weathered the storm well.<br />It takes a long hard look at John Chambers, the \\"country boy\\" turned Cisco CEO and his quest to do \\"whatever it takes\\" to keep Cisco on top. Pointing out along the way that Cisco seems to have stayed on top due to the competitors' failures as well as acquiring at breakneck speed any \\"start-up\\" with the latest and greatest technologies that Cisco can capitalize on.<br />The book also details the stories of the competititors, like Lucent, Nortel, Juniper, and Redback and how they may yet cut into some of Cisco's sales. While I found this book to be very informative not only about Cisco and its history, as well as some background on its competitors, I got the sense the author is silently waiting to see Cisco fall. Whether or not this actually happens of course is another story, one that may take years to unfold.	2002-04-02

I long have worked with engineers who come in to work at 10 or 11 am but stay until almost midnight every day and never quite understood why until now. It's the desire to continue to tinker with and ultimately complete a project.<br />I will never be a \\"true hacker,\\" since I lack the aptitude and ultimately patience to sit at a computer screen all hours of the day and night trying to solve programming problems, but books like these give me a much better understanding of the ones who are.	2002-03-28

Photos from the 1850's even up to the early 1960s (in the case of Diamond Heights) are shown along with photos of what a particular area of SF looks like today. While this book is a testament to how much the city has grown and changed over the last 150 years, it also shows how resilient it was after the earthquake and fire in 1906 that virtually leveled it.<br />It also makes the reader ponder a little about what life must have been like in San Francisco around the turn of the 20th century. Among the areas shown? The Marina district, Pacific Heights, Market St and the ferry building, several panoramas of the city, the Golden Gate bridge (during contruction and how it appears today), and Nob Hill.<br />Not only are the photos spectacular, but it also offers some history about &quot;the city by the bay&quot; and how some parts of it have changed dramatically and others might still be recognizable to those who visited 50 years ago. An excellent pictorial coffee table book about the city I'm lucky enough to live near.	2002-03-28

This book was mentioned to me as a great place to learn more about \\"the Craft,\\" in fact the person who first told me about it called it a \\"Wiccan textbook.\\" While someone not new to Wicca may find this book covers a lot of material mentioned elsewhere, someone new to this as I am will find this book fascinating.<br />What I liked about this book was that it provides a very nice overall reference to Wicca, which as someone new to this religion is something very important to me. There is a tremendous amount of information in this book, in fact at times it was almost overwhelming. Among areas covered are examples of rituals for various Sabats, handfasting, and Drawing Down the Moon and Sun, herbs, essential oils, candles, words and terms used in Wicca, pantheons of Gods and Goddesses of different cultures, nature spirits, and so on. Reading through this book gave me a sense that the information contained within it can be a source of \\"great power\\" if used correctly.<br />As I said before, this may not be \\"the one true Wiccan book,\\" and those with some knowledge may already know most of what in here, but still I found it to be an excellent guide to Wicca.	2002-03-26

It was at this point I became lost.<br />That's one problem with this book. You're going along fine and all of a sudden you realize you've missed something somehow.

It describes each protocol, the differences and advantages and disadvantages of each one. Chapter one offers an overview of what is involved with routing, and subsequent chapters discuss Routing Information Protocol (RIP), Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP), Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP), RIP-2 (an updated RIP protocol), Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), and finally Border Gateway Protocl (BGP-4).<br />Each protocol is described in terms of how it is used in routing, what header fields they contain, and what its best uses are. There are also numerous examples in each chapter that further illustrate what role each protocol plays in routing data from one hop to the next. Any system administrator wishing to know more about the inticacies of Internet routing should pick up this book.	2002-02-28

She immediately makes you comfortable reading and discussing various items, it's almost as if you were meeting her for coffee and discussing things like what sex toy to buy, what adult video might be best, etc. She mentions her former job at a woman-owned sex toy shop in NYC called Toys in Babeland and how she was partially motivated to write this book based on her experiences working there, in her desire to further educate people about sex.<br />And that's another thing I loved about this book; the amount of information about various items, such as different types of vibrators and dildoes, a chapter about the G-spot and female ejaculation, sexual communication and safe sex, a section on female anatomy, and a chapter about \\"back door betties and bend over boys (anal sex),\\" just to name a few. And the accompanying illustrations (esp the female anatomy ones) are wonderful too. Tristan knows quite a bit about the topics she discusses and it shows. I would recommend this book to anyone.<br />I'm so glad to live in an era where sex-positive information is readily available. Bravo Tristan for a job well done!	2002-02-13

IPv6 is a streamlined version of the current IP version, IPv4 and among the topics this book covers is these various differences.<br />The book starts off in the first few chapters with a &quot;history&quot; of IPv4 and the reasons why it needs to be updated, along with a brief &quot;intro&quot; to it. One thing I hadn't known about previously was the &quot;Internet model&quot; of internetworking, which as four levels instead of the standard seven with the OSI model. Also covered are reasons why IPv4 no longer &quot;works&quot; and then the origins of IPv6.<br />One thing too about Ipv6 that because it is a streamlined version of IPv4, that items like headers and such are streamlined as well, some items necessary in IPv4 are not needed with IPv6. Other issues covered? Addressing, Routing, Security, related protocols, and transition strategies.<br />IPv6 is already being implemented around the world and this book, albeit a bit dated at this point offers an excellent description of the &quot;next generation&quot; version of IP.	2002-02-11

The author's gentle, relaxed and even at times jovial approach to explaining Wiccan concepts made it easy to read and to learn more about this ancient religion. I found myself nodding silently at some of the things he said. He also takes great pains to explain that what he says in this book is not the \\"be all\\" of wicca, just that as the book calls itself, a guide for those folk who practice wicca in a solitary manner. You are free to design your own rituals and practice them in whatever way feels most comfortable to you.<br />The book is divided into three major sections: theory, practice and the standing book of shadows, all well done. Wicca at times from the way the author describes it can be a joyful experience. Interesting how a lot of the so-called \\"Christian holidays\\" actually evolved from Pagan ones. Various Sabbats and of course the celebrating of the various equinoxes are traditional Wiccan holidays, and most correspond to modern day holidays, Imbolc for example falling on the same day as Groundhog Day.<br />My friend refers to this book as her \\"Wiccan bible.\\" While some may call this comparison sacrilegious or heresy, I say the only way to judge for yourself is to read this book for yourself.	2002-02-07

What I did get instead was a book that while being primarily an overview describes the history of America in a clear, concise, and objective manner. As I enjoyed US history in school, reading through various chapters reminded me of &quot;names from our past,&quot; George Washington, Davy Crockett, Kit Carson, &quot;Blackjack&quot; Pershing, Teddy Roosevelt, FDR, etc. It also makes it easy to recount historical facts. One thing that stood out as I read through the book: the amount of violence in our past, be it wars with either the Indians in the early days of our history or with other countries. Of course, both World Wars were major conflagrations that required our assistance in stopping.<br />I will agree with one other reviewer on one point. This book I feel would have benefitted from some maps showing the routes that early voyagers to America took, progress of the colonies, what parts of the US were acquired through various treaties or purchases, etc. Perhaps these could be added in a future edition. Other than that, this book gives a good recounting of our history, up to Y2K.	2002-01-28

While BAE 2001 is quite good, this edition has some excellently written, memorable, and just plain hot stories. From S&M by Gabrielle Glancy, to the longing described in Somewhere I Have Never Travelled by Claire Tristam, to examining traditional \\"Indian matchmaking\\" in Fish Curry Rice by Ginu Kamani, the SM-laced \\"The Manicure\\" by Nell Canberry and to a lesser extent of \\"the women getting the upper hand\\" in Essence of Rose, Big Hungry Woman, and The Fishing Show, this is an anthology that is never dull and at times quite erotic. Even in stories that weren't necessarily my \\"cup of tea\\", I found myself riveted to them. Carol Queen's excerpt story (From the Leather Daddy and the Femme) is also especially hot and nasty.<br />This collection of stories inspired me to start writing erotica again and who knows?

In fact, she asked me to read her one of the book's stories as we made love. Even though I may be totally straight, I loved the fun and intriguing stories in this book. It almost makes me wish I was bisexual, with all the rich, exotic, and at times playful scenarios contained within the book's collection of stories.<br />Stories like \\"First Hello,\\" \\"Pissing In the Men's Room,\\" \\"Sauce For The Gender,\\" and \\"Anal.\\" The stories present a very affirming view of bisexuality. The characters in these stories for the most part are out to have fun and have some extra variety in their lives.<br />The more erotica I read, the more I realize is isn't just about the ol \\"bump and grind,\\" but also about the character's lives, feelings, predicaments and how they all fit together to make a story sing.

One of many things that struck me while reading this book was how affirming Susie finds the process of writing erotica and pointing out how for decades it was considered the \\"poor stepchild\\" of writing, that no one wanted to admit that erotica could be well-written. And also too how in school any book that was considered \\"dirty\\" could be the subject of much whispering and secrecy among the schoolkids. And how erotica was always an easy target for criticism.<br />What I liked too was the way Susie writes, it's as if you were sitting down with her over coffee or lunch and she describes how to go about reading erotica and what kinds of \\"hooks\\" the author uses to \\"lure you in,\\" how to go about writing it and what kinds of erotica to look for. She points out you should read quite a bit of it to get an idea of how to write your own. That makes sense, since I've gotten inspired for stories to write based on other erotica I've read.<br />She also includes writing exercises designed to show that writing erotica is not something to dive into lightly, that it deserves to be written well, no matter whether your audience is yourself and your lover, or the audience of book or 'zine readers.<br />Having written far too many erotic stories to count, I always wondered if the stuff I wrote was really any good, even if I (and my friends of either gender) thought them to be quite good. I would love to see them stacked up against someone like a Pat Califia or Susie Bright herself, even if they would most likely would pale in comparison.<br />If you enjoy writing erotica, whether it's just for yourself or for an audience, you really need to grab this book, read it and refer back to it often. With major sections on Thinking about Erotica, Reading it, Writing about it, Editing it, and getting it published, Susie gives a lot of wonderful advice. Heck, it's not a bad book about writing in general.	2002-01-16

This \\"new version\\" contains much of the original \\"advice,\\" like \\"connecting\\" and negotiation, but also has new and much-needed information, such as a big section on meeting someone online via chat rooms, mailing lists and/or Internet newsgroups and how to convert from \\"cyber\\" to \\"real-time,\\" and dealing with the fact that their \\"reality\\" may not match yours.<br />There are also chapters describing different \\"scenes\\" (and their 'rewards' and also tips on beginning and ending them)and role play, with short subsections about bondage and submission.<br />I've always enjoyed Ms Hardy's (formerly under the \\"Lady Green\\" pseudonym) and Easton's writing style: informative and at the same time informal enough that you sense they've been through virtually all of the same questions a bottom might ask of themselves or their partners. This truly is an excellent update to a classic SM instructional book.	2002-01-05

For every technological breakthrough, there are also seemingly endless legal questions that eventually come up. This book attempts to address the major legal issues regarding the Internet. As such, it's a great guide to the most common legal questions to be asked.<br />While the book sticks to 101 specific legal topics concerning the 'Net, most of them apply to such areas as &quot;legal contracts,&quot; &quot;digital signatures,&quot; &quot;liability,&quot; medical transactions, privacy, advertising, and online banking. While some of the material covered here might seem to be &quot;common-sense,&quot; as with any other form of law, it always pays to be totally informed.<br />If you do any web surfing, e-commerce or any other Internet activity that might be &quot;governed&quot; by laws, this is an excellent book to keep handy, not just as a learning tool, but also as a quick reference.	2002-01-05

From the chronology of the state, to recording historic events, and sidebars about influential people in its history, this book takes a wonderful look back over the past 150 years.<br />Since the book was written by staff members of the Oregonian, it reads like a &quot;newspaper account&quot; of the days leading from Oregon's inception to the present. But what an entertaining account. From the early days, through the &quot;turn of the century, the roaring 20's, the Depression, wartime, the fifties, turbulent 60s, up to the year 2000, all events are well-documented.<br />I never knew for example that Tom McCall when he was governor in 1970 staged the only ever state-run rock concert. I only saw him years later when I lived in Oregon and saw him deliver commentary on the evening news. I knew of course about Vanport and its horrendous end. I also remembered the bad flooding in 1996, having been in Portland the weekend before it happened. And of course, who could ever forget Mt. St. Helens erupting in 1980? These of course are just a few of the events that have occured in Oregon's history<br />I mentioned sidebars about influential people. People like McCall, Artie Wilson (a famous Pacific Coast League baseball player now living in Portland), Beverly Cleary (who wrote the Henry books I loved as a kid), Neil Goldschmitt, and the current Portland mayor Vera Katz, among others.<br />I have always loved the state of Oregon and its people, even if I'm a dreaded &quot;Californian.&quot; This book reinforces my love and admiration of the state to the north of me.	2001-12-27

The final section lists a \\"daily event calendar\\" for the month of December. It's interesting to know how each day of the month it seems is set aside for some \\"celebration\\" or other if you choose to celebrate each of them.<br />Even if this holiday season is almost over, this still is a fun book to have not just as an informal \\"holiday reference\\" book, but also as a way to enjoy the entire holiday season.	2001-12-24

There are also chapters on finding and downloading MP3's, the software you can find to play them, chapters on making your own MP3's (hence the terms \\"ripping,\\" digitizing, and \\"sound squishing\\"). There's good advice if you are a musician on marking MP3's, \\"marketing\\" them and where to post them to publicize your work.<br />Also too, there's a long section on MP3's and the law, what's legal and what isn't about them. The author makes a good case for why \\"pirating\\" MP3's are not a good idea, but points out the music industry isn't making any attempt to hold down prices for music to the consumers, hence the popularity in downloading MP3's off the 'Net. There's also a glossary of terms in the back of the book, a reference card in the book's front listing MP3 reference sites, MP3 software sites, and sources for MP3 recordings.<br />This book although now a bit dated offers a good introductory look at MP3's.	2001-12-21

When I began reading this collection, I realized not only how talented these writers were, but that I still had a little ways to go as a &quot;potential erotica writer.&quot; These stories run the gamut from straight, gay, bi, and whatever. Not only was I entertained, but also provided me with the inspiration I needed to create more of my own work, not to mention lots of new fantasies.<br />From stories of &quot;threesomes&quot; to fantasy lovers to oral sex to working in a peep show and phone sex, they present a good view of sexuality. Unlike two or three other reviewers, I liked this collection of stories. While one or two may not have been to my specific interest, I recognized each work as good writing and story telling.	2001-12-19

I wasn't disappointed as it's well-written and filled with excellent information, which I've always found to be true of O'Reilly books. What I enjoyed a lot about this book was its general look first off at what SMNP is, why it's important, SMNP managers and agents, how it in most cases works better with UDP as opposed to TCP, etc.<br />This book also describes the various types of Network Management Services architectures, the compatible hardware and network management software available, how to configure specific SMNP agents to monitor a specific device on a network, and how polling works, among other topics.<br />As always with O'Reilly books, there's a wealth of reference information at the back of the book (for example, Using Input and Output Octects, command line tools, and a list of SNMP RFC's to refer to for more information). If you're a sys admin or anyone else desiring to learn more about SMNP, this book covers a lot of important SMNP information.	2001-12-18

This book covers a wide variety of topics regarding MP3's, starting off with a brief description of how mp3's came to be, where to find and download mp3's, Internet radio stations, etc. The chapter on digital music and copyright law also contains useful information on just what it and is not legal with regards to having and/or downloading mp3's.<br />It also tells you what software and hardware is the best for playing mp3's and \\"ripping\\" your own mp3's. The descriptions of the software and hardware you can use are quite good. Next are three chapters describing in detail digital audio, along with MPEG audio. Then comes the section any mp3 \\"ripper\\" will be most interested in, ie converting music into mp3 form, by first converting it into a .wav format, then into mp3 and finally recording your own CD's.<br />The book's final chapters are a 'tutorial\\" on various mp3 software ripper programs like Audio Catalyst and Cool Edit. There's also some info about using WinAmp, which is one of the more popular mp3 players (and the one I use). There's also further information about related web sites, other books, even a glossary.<br />The future still looks bright for mp3. Not only is it a way for music lovers to download their favorite songs, it also is a way for new artists to \\"break through\\" by offering their music on various web sites in the form of mp3s.<br />This book offers quite a bit of good information about the MP3 phenemenon.	2001-12-18

While those three words might make the average man cringe or instinctively cover their groin, there are those men who enjoy it immensely and other men and women who enjoy doing CBT to them! It is for these two groups of folks that this book is primarily written for.<br />Among the topics Haberman covers here include basic male anatomy (and there's quite a bit to know about it!), negotiation and safewords, play benefits and risks involved, safe sex play and cleaning CBT toys, all very important subjects to cover.<br />There's also a chapter devoted to various CBT toys, including clamps, ball stretchers and spreaders, cock rings and electrical toys just to name a few. There are also diagrams included on how these toys are to be used, as well as several diagrams on tieing up the proverbial cock and balls. There's even a chapter on CBT &quot;recipes,&quot; guaranteed to give the proverbial Dom/me lots of ideas!<br />While CBT may not be my idea of a good time, I fully support those who do enjoy it. I enjoyed the book because it covers the topic well and Hardy's easy-going style makes reading this book fun and enjoyable.	2001-12-05

The book's first few chapters describe how to use DHTML, adding style sheets,  scripting events, and also discusses different browser compatibility issues. However, the book's real value is in the Reference section, which takes up most of the book. Extensive reference chapters on HTML, DOM, Style Sheet Atributes, JavaScript information are where this book's real value lies.<br />While definitely not a book for beginners, it is most likely the best DHTML reference book available.	2001-11-09

It shows you how to heighten arousal, add to roleplay, and enhance a connection with your partner, among other topics. While the topic of using hypnosis had in the past made me a bit nervous, Masters' approach to the topic is at times gentle and humorous and makes you comfortable with using it. As he points out, it is not about coercion or being forced to be hypnotized against your will. And the book's scenario examples are quite entertaining to read.	2001-11-07

While other books may concentrate on the &quot;theory&quot; or &quot;best way&quot; to do poly, this one is the most straighforward. Among the topics discussed? Well love and sex of course, but what is stressed here is that they are not necessarily one and the same, one may be an expression of the other but they CAN be completely separate. You can love someone else and make love to them without depriving your &quot;primary&quot; partner of the same feelings and actions. That jealousy is always lurking in the background, but that you can overcome it and that communication is key. And that's another topic discussed..as well as time constraints, respecting privacy and property of all your different partners, coming out to your kids about your relationship, &quot;care and feeding of your sex toys,&quot; just to name a few.<br />If you're new to polyamory or even just learning about it, this book is a great place to start.	2001-11-07

It describes not only the various types of &quot;malicious programs&quot; out there, but also the environments in which they run. The book's second chapter discusses DOS based viruses, and even if DOS is not that popular anymore, it is good for a historical reference.<br />The book goes on to discuss Windows-related viruses, macro viruses, as well as Trojans and worms. Each chapter gives examples of what to look for if you suspect you have been infected, and the early chapters give summaries of &quot;famous viruses of the past.&quot; Also discussed are attacks involving IRC and other instant messaging programs, browser technologies, malicious Java applets, and what types of attacks can occur with Active X. There's also a chapter devoted to email attacks.<br />The book finishes off with chapters on hoax viruses, which can be just as dangerous sometimes as real viruses, when people assume the hoaxes are true, how to defend against malicious code, and finally what the future entails.<br />Malicious code unfortunately is a way of life and this book offers lots of information on how to avoid them and also what to do if your computer does get infected.	2001-11-06

This book is in fact the \\"bio\\" of Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, an operating system (OS) that has been described as an \\"alternative\\" to Windows for PC users. In it, Linus describes his early years, how he mostly loved to play with computers, spending hours and hours on an old Commodore, and then a Sinclair PC, and so forth. After saving up to buy a better PC, he describes how he tried to install Minix, a form of the Unix OS on his machine and ran into so many frustrations he decided to create his own OS, which eventually became Linux. He describes that process, as well as his \\"flame war\\" over the Internet that he encountered with Andrew Tannenbaum, the Minix creator. Another thing I noticed from this book is how Linus doesn't look at himself as any kind of \\"hero\\" or \\"amazing person\\" just because he created something so many computer folk use as their OS of choice. Essentially, Linus comes off for the most part as just another average guy, even if this \\"average guy\\" created something quite amazing and became the most famous example of \\"Open Source software.\\"<br />Interesting story from the \\"Linux creator\\" himself, as to how Linux first came to be and what it is today, as well as about the man himself.	2001-09-05

As a novice DW user (but not at web design), I found the tutorials to be very helpful in learning more about this complex product. Among the topics covered? Basics like text fomatting, adding links, and images. The book's second part goes into more advanced subjects like Tables, Frames, and Cascading Style Sheets.<br />It also explains forms and inserting JavaScript into your code, as well as incorporating other types of media (like Flash &amp; ShockWave) into your file. There were certain items I'd seen in web site code done in DW that I'd never understood and thanks to this book, I certainly do now.<br />If you're a novice (like me) or even an intermediate DW user, this book is well worth having not only to learn more but to keep as a handy reference.	2001-08-22

Starting with a basic understanding of what a computer is, what it can do with the proper software, and a brief history, it then goes on to describe a program's &quot;anatomy.&quot; There's also descriptions of the early programming languages like FORTRAN, COBOL, even RPG and Pascal (which would later be the forerunner to C). And then on to &quot;modern-day&quot; languages like C, C++, and Visual Basic.<br />In fact, the book devotes much of its concept to Visual Basic (VB), stating that a lot of the concepts in learning VB can be applied to other programming languages. The book devotes several chapters about VB, along with numerous helpful diagrams that help to show the different concepts being described. Subsequent chapters take on other languages like C and C++, along with batch and scripting languages. I never realized how simple a scripting langauge could be to put together.<br />There's also a big section on &quot;Internet programming languages,&quot; like HTML, DHTML, XML, Java, and Javascript. While they are only touched upon briefly, you still get a general idea of how each langauge works. While it may be a stretch to call HTML and XML &quot;languages&quot; per se, they are still obviously important to know if you plan to do any web programming.<br />This is an excellent book for a beginning programmer or even for a technical writer who wants to know a little bit about programming concepts.	2001-08-16

I felt stressed in a number of areas in my life and when I started reading this I understood why she suggested it to me. Some of Carlson's thoughts and exercises are great and good reminders of what the real priorities in life are about. Learning to \\"let go\\" or thinking about the overall picture. I was worried about whether a relationship I'm in would work out or not and I thought of the \\"Will this really matter a year from now\\" exercise. And also the chapter on \\"The Snowball Effect of Your Thinking.\\" A lot of the things in here are kind of common sense, but we never stop to think about these ideas. Things like \\"Choosing Your Battles Wisely\\" or \\"Becoming a Better Listener\\" just for example.<br />This book is truly one about ways to improve your life as well as being able to step back, take a deep breath and enjoy life.	2001-08-16

This book gives some great insight into the mind of the hacker. And note hacker, NOT cracker! Hackers are unjustly maligned by the media as being evil types who just want to wreak havoc on big business and government computer systems, when in reality they view breaking in on security systems as a hobby and almost always alert the authorities to the system break-in.<br />This dictionary of hacker terms (which can be hilarious, informative, or esoteric depending on their meaning) gives an idea of the creativity and mentality of the hackers and their distrust of huge corporations (ie \\"Broken Windows\\" for Sun's \\"Open Windows,\\" \\"Windoze\\" for Microsoft Windows, and so on). Reading though the definition of terms gives you an idea of how to \\"talk turkey\\" with said hackers, and even if I will always be just a \\"wannabe\\" hacker, it helps to be able to get an idea of the mindset of the hacker.<br />At the back of the book, there's even a brief compilation of hacker \\"folklore\\" and \\"legends,\\" a portrait of a \\"typical hacker,\\" and ways to help the hacker culture grow (like getting a free Unix system or contributing to organizations like the Free Software Foundation).<br />Books like this one, The Cathedral and the Bazaar, and Open Sources give an excellent view of the hacker culture.	2001-07-26

Taking on a variety of \\"underground\\" activities and how to act cool in all of them, this book covers a wide variety of topics. While the information here at times possibly should be taken with a grain of salt, you never know when it might be handy to know how to handle a situation where you're too drunk or in a strange crowd, or even the best way to become a groupie.<br />The book also provides a fascinating look at these and other so-called \\"taboo topics,\\" and does it well.

So some that are into &quot;kink&quot; choose to keep it a secret.<br />When Someone You Love Is Kinky is a wonderful book to give to a friend or lover to explain to them some of the reasons why you enjoy this lifestyle. The authors take a calm and understanding approach in this book, perfect for non-kinky readers who might wonder why their otherwise &quot;normal-looking&quot; relative takes such delight in activities they themselves may be uncomfortable with.<br />The first couple of chapters deal with how a non-kinky person (such as your partner or best friend) might be feeling after finding out that their friend or lover likes to be spanked, whipped, tied up or &quot;whatever.&quot; The authors obviously have been down this road many times of explaining their kink to so-called &quot;vanilla people&quot; and dealt with either hostile or indifferent reactions. Subsequent chapters explain more about the &quot;world of kink,&quot; how we manage to keep all our activites consensual, and how to better accept your friend's kink. There's a chapter at the end of the book that explains how to deal with finding out it's your partner that is &quot;kinky.&quot;<br />If you've been searching for ways to explain your &quot;kink&quot; to a &quot;non-kinky&quot; person, this book is a great place to start.	2001-07-14

Further adding to this strain is the fact that his wife whom he loves deeply doesn't understand his need.<br />The highly intense scenes described in this book are done so with great care and detail, with Dommes as beautiful as they are cruel. After having read this book, I gained more of an understanding of the desires that submissive men carry and how this male sub (ie the author) deals with them. A fascinating read for anyone interested in erotic power exchange.	2001-07-09
US	52985657	R129R22B4UWW3Y	0596001657	12778893	.NET Framework Essentials (O'Reilly Programming Series)	Books	5	32	37	N	N	Interesting look	Could the future of computing include a time when you write a document in Word that's on a server in Redmond? That possibility is one of many that Microsoft envisions with their new .NET technology. And no matter how you feel about what Microsoft is doing, their new technology which is an attempt to compete with Sun's Java language is an intriguing attempt.<br />This book covers a wide range of topics about this technology, starting off in Chapter 1 with an overview of .NET. Chapter 2 discusses Common Language Runtime, which is .Net's most important component. Chapter 3 discusses programming in .NET and discusses the various objects used in it. While .NET doesn't directly use languages like Java or C++, it does use a lot of Visual Basic and a C offshoot, called C #(ie &quot;C Sharp&quot;) instead. So a lot of object-oriented concepts do apply when programming for .NET.<br />Chapter 4 goes into greater detail about other .NET components, such as shared components, distributed components, transactions, and object pooling. Further chapters discuss how XML works with .NET and World Wide Web .NET services, Web and Windows forms, and of course the usual reference material at the end of the book.<br />A fascinating look at a new technology which ultimately may become a major one.	2001-07-06

While I was too young to see Yogi play, I've always admired him. Not just because of his apparent intent to destroy the English language with all of his malaprops, but also because of his Hall of Fame baseball career and his overall intelligence. When I was young and first heard some of his now famous quotes, I used to derive hours of giggles from them. Now that I am much older and hopefully wiser, I realize that Yogi makes a tremendous amount of sense with his observations. Essentially he's saying things in a short sentence that most of us spend an hour saying.<br />For example, &quot;When You Come To a Fork in the Road, Take it,&quot; he's saying if you have a great chance for something, go after it and don't look back. Or when he says &quot;It Ain't Over Til It's Over,&quot; he's saying the game is never over until the final out or the clock runs out on you. Or &quot;You Can Observe A Lot By Watching,&quot; he's telling his former Yankee players to pay attention to the game they're playing in! After having read this short but fascinating and at times hilarious book, I've gained a new respect for Yogi as one of the truly great minds and people major league baseball has ever been lucky enough to have. While his quotes may prompt English teachers to jump out windows, I hope we get to hear a lot more of them.	2001-06-13

This book takes a look at all of them. Starting off with a brief &quot;history&quot; of how Oracle and Open Source software have combined to build a number of Oracle applications, how Tcl, Perl, and Python have played a part and how to install them, building web-based Oracle apps, how Java, GNOME, and GTK+ also are involved with Oracle software, even a brief mention of how Linux &amp; Oracle work together.<br />There is a wealth of good open source programs around for use with Oracle and this book gives a detailed explanation of how to install and use all of them to your advantage.	2001-06-13

This makes it easy to understand and learn the concepts being discussed.<br />Castro describes the \\"nuts and bolts\\" of XML, discussing first how to write an XML document, and then creating a Document Type Definition (DTD), essential for any XML document. Subsequent chapters describe elements, attributes, values, entities, and namespaces in XML documents. As with the HTML Quick-Start guide, there are coded examples to guide you through each step and topic discussed.<br />While full browser support for XML still seems a ways off, its potential overshadows any questions anyone may have about it. It's still well worth knowing and Castro makes learning about XML quite easy.	2001-06-13

This book is no exception. Magdelene Meretrix has written what could be called the &quot;first sex workers' guide.&quot; Ms. Meretrix has worked in a number of different areas in the so-called sex industry, from working in &quot;live girl booths,&quot; phone sex, a &quot;stripper,&quot; and even had a brief role in an adult film. Drawing on her experiences and those of other women in various parts of the sex worker industry, she gives practical advice about getting a job as an escort, an exotic dancer, phone sex, what things are like in the legal Nevada brothels, the adult film industry, and even &quot;Pro Domme&quot; work. While she cautions against anyone doing anything illegal, the information she relays in all cases is excellent. There's also a great chapter on what to do if you get arrested. Each chapter also features web sites to go to get more information about a specific topic<br />While I'm certainly not planning on getting a job as a &quot;sex worker,&quot; the book was enlightening as to what this &quot;world&quot; entails. While in college in the late 1970s, I took a Human Sexuality class and wrote a term paper on prostitution. It's intriguing to me to see how much about &quot;the world's oldest profession&quot; has changed and how much seems to have stayed the same.<br />While most would look down at sex work as a career or even a respectable job, to paraphrase a famous quote, &quot;anything worth doing is worth doing well.&quot; Kudos to Ms. Meretrix for writing a fascinating book about a topic most look down upon.	2001-06-13

The book first off is visually appealing with lots of diagrams and code examples interspersed with the text. I was tempted just to grab the HTML examples without reading any further! However, what makes the book an even bigger treat is Ms Niederst's casual but very complete writing style. She takes the time to explain a lot of different concepts and ties them all together. Throughout the book, the topics all tie together beginning with Chapters 1 through 5 (the &quot;Getting Started&quot; section), where Niederst explains &quot;web basics,&quot; Chapters 6 through 11 (the &quot;Learning HTML&quot; section), where she explains topics like formatting text, links, tables, and frames. The book's last two major sections cover areas like creating and modifying graphics and even briefly explain advanced topics like Dynamic HTML and Cascading Style Sheets. By the book's end, you have an excellent general understanding of web design.<br />Not only that, but the way the information is presented, the book also is a good reference text for those times when you run into problems. And anyone who has done web sites knows that pretty quickly you'll run into a problem while designing a site. There are a few sections in the book that deal with troubleshooting web design problems. Ms Niederst comments at the back of the book that reading this book is &quot;a lot like sitting in my classroom.&quot; I suspect her students learn quite a bit about web design. So will you after reading this book.	2001-05-30

This question has confounded people for generations. Are we the only intelligent lifeform capable of space travel and communicating with others, or are there other similar races of intelligent beings in the cosmos? With the increasingly popularity of the SETI@home project, which lets PC users use a downloadable screen saver to help in analyzing radio transmissions from space it would seem numerous folk want to help in discovering if others are \\"out there.\\"<br />This book describes in detail the \\"history\\" of SETI (Search for Extraterrestial Intelligence), its motivations for desiring contact with extraterrestials, theories on how likely extraterrestials do exist and if they indeed do exist, how likely they would be able to communicate back to \\"earthlings.\\" There are also chapters devoted to how our technology would enable us to communicate, starting with radio and laser communication, signal processing, teleporting computer bits, using symbols, pictures, and abstract language as a form of communication, and how to go about translating any form of communication we would receive from an extraterrestial.<br />A fascinating book about a fascinating idea and while I don't expect \\"ET\\" to show up on my doorstep any time soon, at least now I know enough that if he does, I'll have some idea of how best to communicate with him.	2001-05-28

I'm an amateur web designer and up until just recently maintained web sites for three different volunteer groups. Now one of them has decided to get another person to run the site. If I'd known about the concepts presented in this book, I might still be running it! The book discusses how to organize the content on a wbe site and covers a lot of areas the average site designer might not consider on first glance. There's nothing more frustrating than being in the &quot;middle&quot; of a site and &quot;getting lost&quot; with no way out other than to start over. While this is an extreme example, too many sites suffer from navigational problems.<br />This book offers choices on how to organize the information on your site, various ways to design it, the types of systems you can use to search for specific data on the site, researching and planning it (with a great outline on what you should include in your research), and the business of creating and maintaining your design. The book's authors stress the importance of keeping everyone in the process involved in it at all times, as well as pointing out that just because you finally finished it does not mean your job is over! There's always the job of keeping the site as current as possible.<br />Anyone responsible for maintaining a site (even if it's just your own) should take a look through this book.	2001-05-13

I even had a chance a few times to listen to KSAN in San Francisco in the early to mid 1970s. In some ways I look back and think those stations were likely the best I ever heard.<br />This book chronicles that era and describes the conditions that brought it about: social unrest and tumultous times, along with extremely restrictive radio programming. In interviews with numerous former &quot;underground DJ's,&quot; they talk about what it was like to be a part of them. The book also goes on to describe the evolution of, and ultimately what &quot;killed&quot; them. It was again the same culture that spawned them in the first place, the &quot;children of the 60s&quot; who later became the &quot;working class heroes and yuppies of the 70s and 80s.&quot; Reading this book brought back memories of an era that most likely will never exist again.<br />As a former college and briefly &quot;pro&quot; disk jockey who still is intrigued by the wild and wooly side of radio, this book was a nostalgic trip back in time.	2001-05-09

Pointing out that all of us deal with various kinds of &quot;manuals&quot; in our everyday lives, the author builds on that as she discusses knowing your audience (including filling out a &quot;technical brief&quot;), creating a document plan and outline (an excellent first step in any document creation), creating your draft, visualizing the document layout, and stressing the idea to keep your documents concise and to the point. I liked that especially, considering how many manuals I've read that were full of &quot;gobbledgook.&quot;<br />There are also sections on various kinds of technical documents, including the famous &quot;user manual,&quot; abstracts, specification sheets (with detailed explanations of the different kinds of spec sheets), giving presentations and &quot;white papers.&quot; Also informative were chapters on doing online research (and the type of search criteria to use when doing this), computer-based and web-based training, and online help. The book also contains some excellent reference information, such as tips for getting published in a technical journal, writing a grant proposal, punctuation and grammar information (and done in a very concise way), even a short glossary of terms.<br />Well-written and full of excellent information for any new or &quot;veteran&quot; technical writer.	2001-05-07

What makes this one different is that it was truly a joint venture by hundreds of different people and done mostly over the Internet. While most bios were done by fans, they still maintain objectivity. They aren't afraid to comment on a specific band's strengths and weaknesses and where a band did something great or not so great. They also give accurate bios of virtually every group that did or still does exist. Not only that, this book chronicles histories of hundreds and hundreds of bands, and not just the most popular ones, but also a lot of the more obscure bands around. While there are a few groups (mostly ones that are extremely obscure) not listed here, the books' editors took great pains to include as many essential bands as humanly possible. As for the ones missing, well there's always the next edition to include them in.<br />Indispensable for any serious rock music fan's library.	2001-05-02

It's a collection of many of his Rolling Stone feature articles, along with a brief update of the personalities involved. Having &quot;come of age&quot; in the 70s, it brought back memories of my own and it gave me insights into some of the most famous rock personalities of the 70s and early 1980s.<br />Fong-Torres has an excellent writing style and &quot;captures&quot; a little bit about what made a lot of these musicians &quot;tick.&quot; His articles are enjoyable to read or re-read if you've seen them before. While part of the title (A BackStage Pass to 20 Years of Rock n Roll) may seem cliched, it fits here. Fong-Torres in his Rolling Stone articles managed to catch a glimpse of an era now long gone.	2001-04-30

This book helps to explain the differences between each of them. The introductory part explains ways to get higher speeds from your current analog modem before diving into the different kinds of high speed Internet options you have.<br />The second part of the book is divided into chapters explaining ISDN, DSL, satellite, and wireless Internet and how each one works. It also gives you an idea of which specific type might work best for your individual needs. The next part of the book is divided into chapters explaining how to install whichever service you've decided on, complete with &quot;installation checklists&quot; at the end of these chapters.<br />There are also a couple chapters devoted to keeping your PC secure from &quot;hacker attacks,&quot; which is always a problem, but even more so if you have this kind of Internet connection. Finally, there's a section devoted to troubleshooting problems, even a glossary at the book's end so you can familiarize yourself with related terms, and if nothing else amaze your friends with your knowledge of this technology!<br />This book provides an excellent overview of the high speed Internt technology available today.	2001-04-25

Even &quot;seasoned&quot; UNIX users can pick up a few facts from here, like the &quot;history&quot; of UNIX, the numerous UNIX operating system &quot;flavors,&quot; and even troubleshooting common system problems.<br />But there's much more here. There are chapters devoted to topics like the different UNIX &quot;shells&quot; (and their descriptions), file manipulation (along with opening, editing, saving, and printing files), working with the X Windows system, UNIX text editors like vi and emacs, and even how UNIX and the 'Net are intertwined with each other.<br />One more thing I liked about this book (besides the wonderful diagrams and screen captures) was the attention paid to describing various UNIX commands and their options. That really helps to &quot;de-mystify&quot; this operating system.<br />Even though I'm more of an &quot;intermediate&quot; UNIX user, I've searched for a long time for a good introductory UNIX book.

In sports bars, around office water coolers, in classrooms, or even family dinners, fans argue about whether or not the '27 Yankees could beat the '98 version or how would the '75 Reds fare against the '54 Indians? As the authors point out in their forward, we as fans appreciate winning. Well yeah it's boring as hell to watch bad teams.<br />This book takes a look at and attempts to &quot;rate&quot; the greatest baseball teams of the 20th century, starting with the 1906 Chicago Cubs and finishing with the 1998 Yankees. Not only do they list the all-time great teams, they also devote a chapter to teams &quot;just missing the cut.&quot; Using a statistical analysis not used before, the authors come to some interesting conclusions. Both authors felt that the '27 Yankees (generally considered to be the best team of all-time) to be number 2 or 3 on their lists, just for example.<br />What I also liked were chapters devoted to the greatest teams of the 19th century, the greatest Negro league teams, and also a section about the team the authors felt was the best minor league team if all-time, the Baltimore Orioles of the 1920s (many players on this team later played for the '29 Philadelphia A's). There's also a chapter devoted to the worst teams of all-time and while one would immediately think of the '62 Mets, amazingly enough, they were only about the fifth worst team. Scary but true.<br />Each chapter also contains sidebars about noteworthy events of that season, the team's descriptions, features on notable players, and even books written about the particular teams.  While statistically-oriented, it's still a fascinating and well-researched book devoted to baseball's greatest teams.	2001-04-16

Then I sat down and skimmed through some of the chapters and became more intrigued. The more I read of this book, the more impressed I was. The authors have written an excellent guide to the field of technical writing.<br />They cover a wide variety of topics in this book, all of them quite important to know about. I've been a tech writer for years and I don't recall reading a book about technical writing that covered so many different areas so succinctly as this one does.<br />Among the topics covered in the book are &quot;what it takes to be a technical writer,&quot; how to get your first &quot;big break,&quot; the process involved in organizing and writing a manual, how to &quot;schedule&quot; writing projects, gathering and organizing the information, the different types of manuals a tech writer is expected to write, indexing, even a few tips on writing.<br />There's a &quot;dark side&quot; to tech writing as well (long hours at times) and the authors deal with this as well.

However, having spent my whole life on the West Coast (and almost all of it in California), I can't say I'm that much of a &quot;weather expert.&quot; I remember living in San Diego in the late 1970s and having a weatherman describe a passing storm front as a series of &quot;squall lines.&quot; I always wondered what exactly that meant. While this book may not define &quot;squall lines&quot; specifically, it does go a long way in explaining our weather. And after reading this book I still may not be a weather expert, but I'm definitely much more knowledgeable about it.<br />I like the Idiot books because they explain a subject in some depth without going overboard, but at the same time don't &quot;dumb down&quot; to the point of telling cutesy jokes to get a point across. This book is no exception. Taking on weather topics from wind and rain, how violent storms (thunderstorms, tornadoes and hurricanes) develop, how air pollution affects us, &quot;global warming,&quot; even how a day to day forecast is put together and how to become a TV weatherman are done in a light but still informative style. There's also some excellent reference material (weather glossary, weather maps, etc.) at the back of the book too.<br />An excellent introductory book about weather and one that I can refer to time and time again.	2001-03-11

While other reviewers of this book may complain that neither of them were interviewed for this book (not that Becker &amp; Fagen would have anyway, given their notorious dislike for interviews), Brian Sweet still does a fine job in detailing the band's history and the &quot;bios&quot; of both men.<br />It's interesting to read about the things going on during the recording of the Dan's early albums, numerous stories and anecdotes are contained in the book; and also the personality &quot;quirks&quot; of Becker &amp; Fagen. Also interesting are the supposed meanings behind so many of the group's cryptic lyrics. While it's nice to have some sort of idea what a song is based on, too much interpretation will only drive you crazy in the long run (at least in my opinion). The book continues on through the &quot;breakup&quot; of Steely Dan in 1981, the &quot;drought&quot; that any 'Dan' fan suffered through the 80s as Becker &amp; Fagen found other creative projects to work on and the joy we all felt when we found out the &quot;band&quot; was back together in the early 1990s.<br />While this updated edition of the 1994 release doesn't really tell too much about what the guys have been doing since '94, it does give a good history up to that point. I feel after having read this book that now I have some small sense of what Becker and Fagen are like. Any Steely Dan fan who wants to learn more about the band's history should go out and grab this book if they haven't done so already.	2001-03-11

Chapters on how it got started and what it is, the actual markup (including detailed explanations of elements, attributes, namespaces, and entities), connecting resources with links, stylesheets, and even one on programming in XML help the reader understand more about how this markup language can be best used.<br />A great book to have if you want or need to learn the &quot;nuts and bolts&quot; of XML.	2001-02-28

They shouldn't. The purpose of this book is more to inform than to scare, but yet the information that Mr. Garfinkel covers is potentially scary and chilling. Advances in computer technology, satellite surveillance, computer hackers, human error, fraud, security and law enforcement technologies, and even terrorists can have a profound effect on our privacy and our lives when these technologies are abused. And as the book shows, this can easily happen.<br />Rather than be scared of it, it's better to be informed and discover ways to fight this invasion of privacy and Mr. Garfinkel provides solutions to this in the book's final chapter.<br />The book details stories of how marketers can find out your name and address easily, how health insurance agencies can use your medical history against you when consdering whether to accept you for a policy, name theft, and even how terrorists can circumvent even the most stringent security procedures in place.<br />This book impresses upon the reader the effect of widespread information gathering efforts and their abuse potential could directly harm them. If you care at all about your privacy, this a book you should read and glean information on how to stop these potential abuses.	2001-02-11

Whether or not Microsoft regards Linux (the most famous example of open source software) as a legitimate threat is an opinion best left to anyone reading it. Free for All in the early chapters compares the &quot;open source movement&quot; to the &quot;1960s era&quot; when there were those who felt the world could be a better place just by sharing the wealth among everyone. Another intriguing comparison is how some compare &quot;open source&quot; to a form of &quot;communism!&quot;<br />Free For All describes some of the &quot;history&quot; of the Open Source movement, items like BSD (and its legal battle with AT&amp;T), how Bill Joy came to invent the Vi text editor and how Richard Stallman invented the Emacs screen editor. But it also details of course how a Finnish programmer named Linus Torvalds came to invent Linux, which Mircosoft seems to regard as some kind of &quot;threat&quot; to Windows. While Microsoft's share of the PC market is overwhelming (aproximately 85%), there are those opting for the &quot;penguin&quot; on their PC. It also opines that the open source movement may now be at a crossroads, does it get too big and start charging for its software or does it remain &quot;free?&quot;<br />There's also a glossary of open source terms at the back of the book that explains to &quot;non-techies&quot; some of the &quot;buzz words&quot; of open source, something I found helpful in explaining the movement.<br />This book is a fascinating look at how the open source software movement has and may yet continue to change how software is marketed.	2001-01-23

Above the book's title on the cover are the words &quot;Help for UNIX System Administrators&quot; and that's precisely what this book is. Starting off with a &quot;primer&quot; on TCP/IP and how data moves around on a TCP/IP network gives anyone new to TCP/IP a general idea of how it all works. There are also chapters on configuring your interface (along with general info on installing PPP &amp; SLIP), routing, network servers, and sendmail, all important parts of a TCP/IP system. Near the book's end, the topics of troubleshooting and network security are also addressed.<br />All the O'Reilly books I have read always have thorough descriptions of the their topics and prove to be excellent sources of information. This book is no exception. If you maintain (or will be maintaining) this type of network, you need this book	2001-01-15

Mr. Segaller has written a fascinating book (which goes along with the PBS series) documenting the history of what is now called the Internet.<br />In addition to the formation of the 'Net, it's also fascinating to trace the rise of many technologies and companies we now take for granted. Items like packet-switching, TCP/IP, Ethernet, as well as companies like Apple, 3Com, Sun, and Cisco to name a few. I found it interesting as well how the 'Net and these various companies worked in a kind of &quot;tandem&quot; to produce the technology we know today. Also fascinating was reading about the visionaries who saw this all coming back in the 1970s.<br />While Steven readily admits his book is probably already obsolete (given the 'Net's constantly changing state and with one update out already), this book is still an excellent historical look at one of the most amazing sociological phenomenons of our time.	2001-01-13

It's a good corollary to those seemingly &quot;seeking gold/riches&quot; in today's Silicon Valley.<br />What struck me most about the book were the stories of excess and power among the Valley's richest executives. People like Larry Ellison, Jim Barksdale &amp; Jim Clark, and Steve Jobs, for example. And yes Bill Gates, even if he is technically about 800 miles to the north.<br />Speaking of Gates, the author makes what I found to be an interesting observation: That the Justice Department's &quot;wish&quot; to divy up Microsoft into two or more companies would not create more competition. His feeling is that any company complaining about Microsoft's so-called &quot;monopoly&quot; would do better to study how Microsoft got to be where they are and why. The rationale being that the Valley tends to &quot;eat its young,&quot; and that it might be easier to stop this &quot;Godzilla&quot; by beating it at its own game.<br />Among the other stories told here? Stories about the people and companies that got left &quot;behind.&quot; Companies like Shockley Semiconductor, academic institutions like the University of Illinois and their original browser, and even people like the tragic figure, Gary Kildal.<br />The stories in this book most likely have been told elsewhere judging by other reviews I've seen. Even so, they are told in entertaining fashion in this book.	2001-01-10

While I as a Dominant like to think of myself as being good with a flogger, I always strive to learn more. Reading this book has definitely caused me to do that. Joseph has put together a wonderful and very informative &quot;guide&quot; to this art. While Joseph cautions that you can't learn all about flogging from a book (and it's true), if you're a novice flogger, this certainly is a good place to start. And if you're a &quot;veteran,&quot; there is still lots of valuable information about flogging to be learned.<br />Joseph divides the book into four main &quot;scenes,&quot; each one designed to bring home certain points about flogging. Whether it's an intense scene between a Master and his slave (and discussing ways to achieve that), or a scene between two people who've never played before (illustrating the basics of flogging), a scene between two people that leaves one uncomfortable (educating your partner and negotiation), or even a &quot;toy cleaning scene.&quot; (explaining how to clean your floggers). There's also information about flogging &quot;technique,&quot; what kind of floggers to buy (including a special subsection about singletails), even a &quot;history&quot; of whipmaking.<br />Joseph Bean has written a number of excellent books over the years about the leather scene; this book is a wonderful addition to them.	2000-12-13

Additionally, his sense of humor makes this book enjoyable to read as you find out about all the features of IRC. This book is useful for anyone who spends time on IRC, from the &quot;newbies&quot; to veteran IRC &quot;addicts&quot; like me. I wish there had been a book like this around six years ago, when I logged on to my first IRC channel.<br />Among the subjects the authors covers include a brief summary of IRC and its history, IRC clients for UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh machines, how to connect to an IRC server, finding various channels and people on IRC, and also a good description about the dreaded &quot;net splits&quot; and lag you will eventually run into on IRC. I just wish the author had gone into more detail about ways to deal with server splits and lag. Maybe the next edition will cover that.<br />More and more users are logging on to IRC all the time (which probably explains why it seems there's always those &quot;splits&quot; I mentioned) and this book is an excellent guide to what you can do on IRC and what to watch out for.	2000-12-11

This book will help you learn more about our weather. I was looking for a book that explained about various weather phenomenon and came across it. I loved it not only because of the pictures and descriptions in the last chapter on various weather types (different kinds of fogs, clouds, storms, precipitation, optical effects, etc), but also for lost of other information covered in the book, but also because the book's other chapters also contained so much excellent information. Subjects like Understanding the Weather (which covers the atmosphere, sources of weather, global wind patterns and different kinds of winds, frontal systems, etc.), Forecasting the Weather (obviously that has never been an exact science!), Changing the Weather, and also a secion on different climates and how humankind and animals adapt.<br />There are lots of pictures and diagrams in this book which help to explain key weather concepts. One day I will force myself to read this book cover to cover instead of getting sidetracked at all the gorgeous illustrations and pictures in this book, every time I pick it up to read it.	2000-12-10

How to Choose a cat, bringing it home, caring for it, health care, breeding and showing a cat, and the cat's long and storied history. There are also lots of good pictures and information. I also liked the section on different breeds and learned about the different &quot;markings&quot; with various cats. I volunteer part-time for a &quot;cat rescue group&quot; and wanted to familiarize myself with some of the &quot;breeds&quot; and mixes we come across and I have learned some interesting things from this book. I grew up with a cat and now have a much better idea of what my mom dealt with with that cat!<br />My one concern with this book is the section on the Bengal breed. I have not ever owned one, but after looking at several other reviews of this book, it would appear the author is misinformed about this breed. Hence my 3-star rating of this book. Great information here for the most part; you may want to read the section on different breeds with a cautious eye.	2000-12-10

The book's sections include one on writing style itself and why it is important, working with an editor, working wit illustrations, writing for an international audience, legal guidelines, the &quot;mechanics of writing,&quot; creating an index, among others. The book makes some good points and provides an informative reference for writing style questions.<br />Two small points against it. The CD is difficult at times to use and the Recommended Reading section lists some books that are out of print. Time for an update perhaps?<br />However, it's still an excellent book to have when having to make decisions about your own company's writing style.

Books	4	11	12	N	N	Intriguing Look at D/s	This book is based on a series of email correspondence the author had with a handful of submissive women who answered ads that he placed on various Internet bdsm personals sites. The correspondence takes on many forms of emotions including love, respect, anger, heartbreak, passion, eroticism, and shows the author to be a man who takes Dominance/submission (D/s) play very seriously.<br />There are a number of D/s stories in the book, written both by the author and the women he corresponds with, parts of which are highly erotic. As a male Dominant, I even picked up a few ideas in his and the women's stories that I might use in my SM play sometime. *s* The stories do get extreme at times, and while the &quot;extreme&quot; parts may not be things I would be specifically interested in, they are still interesting and fascinating.<br />An interesting look at D/s relationships, especially when done over a long period of time and distance using mostly email as the communication tool between the two relationship participants.	2000-12-08

And I was also glad I now knew more about it and knew what I could do to protect myself against some of it. While there are those that might be aghast that some of the information in this book is here (phone phreaking or &quot;hacking somone's password,&quot; for example), I for one am glad it is here. I certainly would not ever use this information for malicious purposes and my feeling is the better informed you are about these and other online &quot;borderline activities,&quot; the better you can protect yourself against them. I certainly feel much more informed about the so-called &quot;darker side&quot; of the 'net after reading this book.<br />Among the subjects Wang covers in this book are online censorship, sections about hackers and some of the things they do, lots of information about viruses (even how to write one and keeping your computer from being infected by one), hate groups online, &quot;waging war against spam,&quot; and even a chapter on Trojan Horses (&quot;Beware of Geeks Bearing Gifs!&quot; Well, I always try to be).

This book truly is a comprehensive guide for not only HTML, but also briefly covers the new hybrid of XML &amp; HTML called XHTML. While it doesn't dive deeply into XHTML, there's not that big a need to do so. Most HTML will work fine in XHTML. The standards for HTML keep changing and this book not only describes the changes, but also which tags have been &quot;depricated&quot; or made totally obsolete and which ones are fairly new. It's nice to know which tags are now considered &quot;obsolete&quot; as well as what kind of tags used to be used in HTML.<br />I've been doing web design for three or four years now and I still managed to find quite a few new &quot;tricks&quot; in several chapters that I hadn't known about before. While the book may not be for total HTML novices, anyone with some HTML knowledge will learn quite a bit here. I certainly have.<br />Besides a brief &quot;history&quot; of HTML, the book extensively covers topics like text manipulation, links, lists, cascading style sheets, forms, tables, frames and a chapter about JavaScript.

The cover of this book features an armadillo, and I like the analogy. I briefly was a system administrator, and you do need to have a thick skin like the armadillo to do this kind of job!<br />Each chapter is very descriptive of specific commands. There is good info on system startup and the section on troubleshooting system crashes is excellent. Also contained are sections on adding users and groups, system security issues, mounting and unmounting filesystems, data backup and recovery issues, a chapter on writing scripts to do some of the &quot;menail sy admin tasks,&quot; and even a chapter on TCP/IP Network Management.<br />The book also explains the &quot;differencies&quot; in various Unix OS's. Different Unix OS (AIX, SunOS, System V, and Solaris have their own little idiosyncracies at times) may have different ways or commands to do a particular task and this book makes a point to explain them all in great detail.<br />Even though the book is a few years old, it still contains valuable information about UNIX system administration.	2000-11-22

Like their pro football book, this book selects what The Sporting News' editors felt who were the greatest 100 baseball players of all time. And it's very difficult to argue too hard with their choices. Babe Ruth at #1 is in my opinion a no-brainer. Ruth really saved the game at a time when it desperately needed a hero and he forever changed the way the game was played with his towering home runs on the field and his &quot;carousing&quot; off it. The book also features a nicely written foreword by the #2 all-time best player, Willie Mays. How honored I am that I got to see him play in his prime some 30 plus years ago as a boy.<br />I like that the choices in this book are unaffected by race, scandal or personality. Josh Gibson, Satchel Paige, Buck Leonard, Cool Papa Bell, and Oscar Charleston of the Negro League made this list. It's truly sad that so many talented ballplayers were kept out of the majors because of their race. Joe Jackson, is another &quot;Top 100 member&quot; who of course was banned after the Black Sox scandal. Others like Ty Cobb, who was a notorious hothead in his day are also here.<br />Reading through the book brought many smiles to my face as I recalled watching so many players, like Harmon Killebrew, Kirby Puckett, Willie McCovey (my all-time favorite), Ernie Banks, and Hank Aaaron just to name a few.<br />So many excellent choices, this book is well-done and a great momento to all the athletes who have made baseball the game it is today.	2000-11-22

When I first heard about style sheets, I cringed because I thought &quot;Oh great..some new complicated thing to learn.&quot; However, once I started reading this book, I began to realize the power of style sheets and how they make designing elements on a web site much easier. While small sites like the ones I design may not need Cascading Style Sheets, I realized very quickly what a pain it could be to have to change the color or font for a H1 or P element on a site containing 50 to 100 pages or more!<br />The book covers a number of different subjects, including browser compatability issues (after all, there doesn't seem to be any elements that all browsers support quite the same way), along with element units and values, fonts and text properties, colors, and visual formatting. I now realize the fascinating things you can do on a web site with the help of style sheets.<br />As with other O'Reilly books, there's a wealth of resources in the Appendixes, including a Resources appendix and a sample Style Sheet, done in HTML 2.0 (It always helps to see what a &quot;sample&quot; sheet looks like in order to further understand what all the element attributes mean).<br />An excellent reference guide to Cascading Style Sheets.	2000-11-14

My thought is that since I am sexual with women only, any book that gives me new information about &quot;playing sexually&quot; with women will be of value to me. And too, the idea of anal sex turns some people off. Some will say &quot;e[...] perverted!&quot; To paraphrase Woody Allen, &quot;Only if you do it right!&quot;<br />There are currently very few (if any) books on the market about this &quot;taboo&quot; subject, which makes it all the more important to read. Besides which, there is information here that applies to both genders. While obviously some of the material is strictly for women (doh!), any male readers can skip the non-applicable parts and concentrate on other chapters, like &quot;10 Myths About Anal Sex,&quot; &quot;Tools of the Trade (ie lube and anal toys),&quot; or chapters on anal anatomy, anal penetration, and anal health, which are ALL important topics for either gender.<br />Three cheers to Tristan for writing an informative book about a topic those of us into may have known little about but should know much more.	2000-11-05

The above is my response to this book. When I first started looking though it and reading some of what Paul Joannides has to say, I thought, \\"Right on!\\" And the more I read, the more I felt this way. Mr. Joannides deserves some kind of \\"Medal of Honor\\" for writing a comprehensive, non-judgmental and at times hip and irreverent look at the world of sexuality. He leaves virtually no topic uncovered. Dang, why wasn't a book like this around twenty years ago? I could have really used it back then! He also obviously put a great deal of effort and love into this book which spans almost 700 pages. Not only is it informative and humorous, but it gets its subject matter across in a down-to-earth and common-sense style. I also loved all the illustrations in the book....<br />This book in my humble opinion should be mandatory reading for every Human Sexuality class taught, it truly is that good. I lost count of all the various chapters in the book, but among them are [chapters on various types of sex] sex and aging, and a chapter about sex laws (and some of them are truly shocking). Most chapters also feature comments from readers of earlier editions of this book or those who filled out surveys on the publisher's web site; all of which are also highly informative and interesting.<br />I give this book five stars, only because I can't give it six. Highly recommended to anyone who wants to learn more about sex, relationships, what makes the \\"opposite gender\\" act the way they do, in other words virtually everyone!	2000-11-05

I was fascinated by it and its description of a succesful \\"open-source\\" product, and the idea of \\"giving away\\" the source code of a computer prodict that others could read and improve on.<br />When I found out about this book much more recently (a series of other essays by Raymond describing the \\"effects\\" of open source on the computer industry), I knew I had to get a copy. I was not disappointed by any of the essays Raymond writes in this book. In fact, I found myself intrigued as I found out more about the world of \\"hackers\\" (as opposed to \\"crackers,\\" who seem only to be very destructive types that are always confused with hackers), their \\"code of ethics, rules and society,\\" and the recent, current, and potentially future effect open-source has and will have in the computer industry. Speaking of hackers, Raymond even offers advice on becoming a hacker, in one of the appendixes of the book!<br />Raymond's uses of analogies throughout his essays bring home key points. One great example of course is his use of the teams \\"cathedral\\" and \\"bazaar\\" in the title essay in the book to describe the concept of designing an open-source program as opposed to not making the code free for anyone to view. A great example of course of an open source product is the Linux operating system, which seems to slowly be gaining in use among PC owners. The more I hear about it, the more I'm thinking of installing it on my PC!<br />If you want to get a great idea about what \\"open source\\" is really about and how it got and continues to become more popular, this book is well worth buying and reading.	2000-10-20

This book details its history and shows how greed and paranoia among major league baseball owners denied the minors their chance to bask in the major league sun.<br />Many major league teams around today, like the Baltimore Orioles and Milwaukee Brewers were originally long-time minor league teams which should have had an opportunity to become major league teams on their own. The book devotes a chapter to the original Baltimore Orioles who had a dynasty of their own in the 1920s, and another chapter to the Newark Bears' dynasty of the 1940's and early 1950s. Chapters are also devoted to the American Association, the Texas League and Branch Rickey. Rickey revolutionized minor league baseball with his idea of developing major league talent by &quot;farming out&quot; new players to minor league teams.<br />Sullivan also talks about the PCL's attempt to become the third major league in the late 1940s. Alas, many minor leagues before had attempted this and all were 'shot down' in their attempts. The last section of the book details the fall and subsequent rise of the minor leagues.<br />Although it's a bit dated now, this book does an excellent job cataloging the history of the minors.	2000-10-15

He takes us on a behind the scenes look at what went on inside the 49ers' organization while Montana, Craig, Lott, Rice, and company were on the field leading the team to victory every fall Sunday afternoon throughout the 80's and most of the 90s.<br />He starts off with Eddie DeBartolo buying the team in the mid 1970s, through the terrible times of the late 70s, the hiring of Walsh and the rebuilding of the team, Walsh's early innovations, &quot;The Catch&quot; in 1981 that sent the 49ers to their first Super Bowl, the struggle to stay on top through the 1980's, the turmoil that eventually motivated Walsh to quit coaching in 1989, the Seifert era of the 1990's to the disaster that was the 1999 season.<br />What I found especially interesting was the portrayal of Edward DeBartolo, the 49ers former owner. I had always thought he seemed like a true gentlemen, always gracious to the media and generous to a fault with 49er employees and players. Dickey paints a much different and truer picture of him behind the &quot;facade.&quot; Here was a man who raged after every defeat, and whose vices eventually landed him in trouble.<br />Dickey has written several books about the 49ers and at least one I know of with Bill Walsh. If they're as good as this one, they're all well worth reading.	2000-10-15

If you like me grew up watching those great old Warner brothers cartoons and still love them, this book is for you. Listing virtually every cartoon the Warner brothers studio put out from the 1930s through the late 1980s was quite a task. And I'm sure Beck &amp; Friedwald must have thought it would never end (&quot;sayyyy, there's something awfully screwwy goin on around here!&quot; to quote Elmer Fudd).<br />Yeah by year each cartoon that was ever made is listed, complete with the people who produced it, date of original release, list of characters, and the plot and story of the cartoon. There's even a list at the back of the book of all the network TV cartoon specials.<br />If you've ever read anything about the cartoonists that did these cartoons, you know they were probably a bit loony themselves. But Thank God, they had such a creative outlet for their looneyness!<br />The book is 11 years old, and I would love to see an updated version. Even so, if you're a Warner brothers cartoon fan like me and want a book that is an excellent resource for all these great old cartoons, this book is a must!	2000-10-12

How do you go about picking the greatest 100 football players of all time? There are going to be agreements about who should be on it, and lots of disagreements about who should or shouldn't be on it. This book tackles an extremely difficult job and comes out a winner. Whether or not you agree with all the choices here, you have to admit they picked some damn good ones.<br />Each page contains pics and a bio on the player. They list Jim Brown as number 1. Funny how just the other night I was in a local sports bar, and a man sitting next to me said &quot;Jim Brown was the greatest player I ever saw.&quot; Obviously, this book agrees with my &quot;friend.&quot; In fact, the book's forword is written by Brown.<br />In addition to TSN's Top 100 players listed in numercial order, there's also a &quot;timeline&quot; of when these players were active. Also listed are TSN's all-decade teams. Leafing through the pages brought back memories of players I have watched and enjoyed, and of players whose exploits I only read about years after their careers ended.<br />So do you agree with all the choices in this book? The only way to find out is to buy it and judge for yourself. I guarantee it's well worth the money.	2000-10-12

The 1998 baseball season was truly one of the most magic in recenty years, thanks in part to the &quot;home run battle&quot; between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa. This book chronicles their achievement which I suspect will grow to legendary tones in the years to come. The sportmanship between these two hereos was evident all season long, and the book reflects that.<br />Perhaps it was fitting that McGwire should wind up in a city that is a true &quot;baseball town,&quot; and one that could truly love and cherish his accomplishment. I remember watching the game on TV where McGwire broke Babe Ruth's home regular season home run record and even the Cub players stood and applauded him. This book remembers that.<br />It starts off with pictures of McGwire and a nice foreword by Jack Buck, the longtime St. Louis Cardinals' broadcaster. There's also a brief story about Maris and Ruth, the men McGwire chased for most of that long summer. And then the home runs. Each page is devoted to a description of each one; the date, the opposing pitcher, the final score and so on.<br />Reading through each page brought back all those wonderful memories of the 1998 season for me. This book is a wonderful treasure and keepsake to celebrate an incredible baseball season by one man.	2000-10-12

Some are filled with great technical information, but are difficult to follow, because of the realm of information. Others are easier to read, but lack some important details. This book strikes a happy medium: full of excellent information, but still written in a style that's easy to follow and understand.<br />Among the topics covered besides obviously &quot;TCP/IP&quot; are network addresses and names (and assigning them), internetwork architecture, routing protocols, broadcasting and multicasting, and TCP/IP applications. There are also chapters about IPv6 (the so-called &quot;next generation of IP&quot;) and brief chapters on intranets and extranets.<br />The book also contains a wealth of other resources. At the end of each chapter is a list of relevant RFC (Request For Comments), so the reader can learn more. The Appendixes also contain other references, a biliography and even a glossary of terms.<br />Another reviewer said if he could only have one book about TCP/IP, this would be it. I wholeheartedly agree.	2000-09-29

Before I started reading this and also &quot;Learn SQL in 10 Minutes,&quot; by Ben Forta, I had a mortal fear of databases, one that thanks to this book I now realize is totally unfounded. This book has a lot of good technical information about SQL, but it's presented in a way that makes it easy to understand and won't &quot;scare off&quot; the beginners like me. I liked how the author took great pains to explain a lot of SQL commands, making them relate to the topic being discussed.<br />The first two chapters cover relational database and SQL fundamentals. The next few chapters discuss more details about SQL, first its &quot;languages,&quot; then how to build a SQL database, and once it's built how to retrieve data from it, and also issues relating to keeping it secure.<br />Generally, a good &quot;Dummies&quot; book on a complex subject.	2000-09-27

This book is true to its name as it covers the so-called Internet Core  Protocols (TCP/IP, UDP, ARP, ICMP, and IGMP) very well. Chapter 1 is an  overview of TCP/IP, Chapter 2 is an introduction to IP, and subsequent  chapters describe the other protocols. The final chapter is a very detailed  description of TCP. As an end-user who desired to learn more of the  &quot;basics&quot; of these protocols, I learned quite a bit about how each  protocol works.<br />Each chapter describes the &quot;inner workings&quot; of  each protocol, complete with sections on headers, messages, and so forth.  Numerous screen captures help you gain further understanding of how each of  these protocols works with each other. Not only is each protocol described  well, there are also sections in each chapter on troubleshooting  problems.<br />The appendices describe how the Internet Standardization  process, ie how RFC's (Request For Comments) get created and the processes  they have to go through to be accepted.

It briefly discusses the attacks earlier this year on various  well-known web sites and notes that one effective way of (if not toally  stopping) slowing down these types of attacks is by use of a firewall.<br />In  the first section, it talks about the reasons for having a firewall and  security strategies. The second section (Building Firewalls) consists of  several chapters and describes topics like packet filtering, firewall  architectures and design, proxy systems and bastion hosts. I gleaned a lot  of good information from this section alone.<br />The next section contains  chapters describeing how to protect against attackers invading any Internet  services (World Wide Web, email &amp; netnews, FTP, IRC, DNS, games, etc).  The last section describes methods to keep your network secure, such as  settinp up security policies, how to maintain your firewall once it's up  and running, and how to deal with a &quot;break-in.&quot; There's also  three appendices containing various information about firewall tools,  mailing lists and newsgroups.<br />All in all, an excellent book on building  and maintaining a firewall.	2000-08-23

The book has  three main parts: Becoming a Mistress, The Mistress In Action, and  &quot;The Five Archetypical Fantasies.&quot;<br />Mistress Lorelei's  &quot;instructions&quot; are intelligent, well-thought out and easy to  follow. This is a woman who is 'wicked' in a delightful way. In the first  chapter, she explains the 'benefits' of becoming a Mistress, and in the  next chapter explains some pitfalls you may encounter and how to avoid  them. She also explains how to find a male submissive and maintaining your  fantasy and reality in subsequent chapters.<br />Part two of the book explains  how to establish and assert your dominance and also the &quot;tools&quot;  you can use. The use of spanking, flogging, paddling and other techniques  are covered here.<br />Part three covers the main Fem Domme fantasy types and  covers them well and explains that you can take something from each fantasy  type in the &quot;scenes&quot; you do. Even though I'm a male Dominant, I  found some of her ideas useful for my own play.<br />I also recommend SM101 by  Jay Wiseman and Screw the Roses, Send Me the Thorns by Philip Miller &amp;  Molly Devon as good introductory books, along with this book if your  interest lies in female domination.	2000-08-11

Well-researched and entertaining, O'Neal takes us from the league's  beginning in 1902, through World Wars I &amp; II, to the &quot;rise and  fall&quot; of the minor leagues in the 50's, the league's demise and  'resurrection' in the 1960s.<br />As with other O'Neal books, it is filled  with sidebars, chapters on player nicknames, stadiums, and histories of  each league team. One thing about reading these books is discovering how  many players you remember from your youth got their start with one of the  AAA minor leagues.<br />While the American Association may have not have had  'dynasties,' like the Pacific Coast League and the International League, it  did have a number of long-time teams, like the Minneapolis Millers &amp; St  Paul Saints, the Indianapolis Indians, and the Toledo Mud Hens just to name  a few.<br />Any fan of this league (sadly now defunct) will enjoy this book.

It starts off with a short history of ballpark construction, detailing the styles of each generation of parks. It's interesting how in  the the 90s, the trend was to go back to the &quot;old-style&quot; stadiums  like Camden Yards, Jacobs Field, and Pac Bell Park, here in San  Francisco.<br />The authors resisted the urge to badmouth any of the stadiums  that have been widely criticized, such as the &quot;cookie-cutter&quot;  stadiums of the 70s like RiverFront Stadium (now Cinergy Field) in  Cincinatti or Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia, choosing instead to  concentrate on the positives and the experience of being at a particular  park. I loved the description they gave of Candlestick (aka 3Com) Park, a  stadium that for better or worse became my &quot;home park&quot; when I  moved to Northern California.<br />The illustrations of each park, coupled  with famous moments brought back a ton of memories for me. There are also  numerous pictures of each ballpark, giving the reader a sense of history  for each one. The book is divided into several sections, starting with the  classic parks, like Wrigley &amp; Fenway, through the current class of  stadiums, to the ones not around anymore. Reading through the last section,  I regretted not having had the chance to see games in some of these old  parks.<br />One minor disapointment was that temporary parks (SF's Seals'  Stadium, LA's Wrigley Field &amp; Coliseum, Philly's Baker Bowl, Seattle's  Sicks' Stadium, for example) were not mentioned. Perhaps a future edition  could include them?<br />But other than that, this book is an excellent and  entertaining reference that will keep you intrigued for hours at a time. A  related book to buy if you haven't is the Lawrence Ritter book, Lost  Ballparks.	2000-07-28

The second edition of this book is a big upgrade from the first edition, which was a huge project on its own. This edition not only contains names of virtually every existing team from the 1800's up to the present day, but  also contains complete standings of all leagues, major and minor from 1884  through 1996.<br />The editors of this book did an amazing amount of research  for this book and it shows. In addition to each league's standings, there  is also a list that shows each major league team's farm system (From the  1930's on to the present). Some teams like the St. Louis Cardinals of the  1930s had as many as TWELVE minor league farm teams! With each team are  listed their won-lost records, their attendance figures, and the team  managers.<br />It's fascinating to look at how each team in a league did over  a 10, 20 or even 30 year period, or how different leagues came and went.  Along with each league standings are lists of league leaders in batting and  pitching.<br />Each section of the book is divided into decades and at the  beginning of each section is a summary of the period. There's a tremendous  amount of reference information listed in the beginning of the book (ie  teams listed by league, city, state and counties and leagues from year to  year).<br />At the back of the book are listed all-time records for active and  inactive leagues. Standings for independent leagues, (which became popular  in the mid 1990s) which aren't always available in other baseball reference  books are included here.<br />Any minor league history fan will love this  updated and vastly improved book.<br />Also recommended are any of the Bill  O'Neal minor league history books and also The Grand Minor League by Dick  Dobbins.	2000-07-26

First known as the &quot;Eastern League,&quot; (and several other names over its first 30 years) this league at one time or other has had teams not only in the US, but also Canada (Toronto and Montreal), Cuba (Havana), and even briefly Puerto Rico (San Juan).<br />He starts off at the pre-1900 beginnings of the league, then takes us through the &quot;Great War&quot; and how it afected the league. He describes the beginnings of a Baltimore player (known then as &quot;Dunnie's Babe&quot;) signed by Jack Dunn, the Baltimore manager and owner who later became known simply as Babe Ruth. O'Neal also describes the 1920's dynasty ] that Dunn put together with his team, the Baltimore Orioles. These teams may possibly have been the greatest minor league dynasty in history.<br />He also goes on the describe another dynasty, the Newark Bears of the late 1930's to early 1940's, the effects of World War 2 and television on the league, as well as the effects of the Castro Revolution on the Havana Sugar Kings of the late 1950's. He also discusses how the league fell on hard times in the 1960's, but bounced back with a fervor in the 1980s.<br />Numerous sidebars throughout the book mention anecdotes and famous stories. One of my favorites was indeed the one about Fidel Castro, who would attend games in a special seat while surrounded by numerous soliders. There are also illustrations and pictures of numerous IL stadiums, and diagrams of the players and stats for several pennant winning teams in the league's history.<br />A very entertaining look at baseball's oldest minor league.

But once I started reading it, I asked myself why I had waited so long to learn about SQL. Ben Forta 'demystifies' SQL and does it in a way that  simplifies learning about this database language. True to its name, this is  a book that can be read quickly.<br />Ben keeps all concepts clear and simple.  By the time I'd finished the book, I had a basic understanding of SQL and  realized my own fears had kept me from learning about it.<br />While I'm not  ready to program in SQL, this book has now allowed me to at least be  conversant in it and has given me a good general understanding about this  database language.	2000-07-06

In this book, he covers a wide variety of etiquette topics, ones that those in so-called  &quot;vanilla&quot; stituations would never encounter, but ones that crop  up in kink-friendly situations.<br />Good etiquette and protocol is seemingly  a lost art these days, and a book like this is certainly welcome. I liked  Drew's observation on Old Guard/New Guard protocol. This is a somewhat  mythical area that everyone in the kink scene has strong opinions about.  Drew's sense of humor at times will keep you well entertained as you learn  the &quot;ins and outs&quot; of proper etiquette.<br />A great book for anyone  who appreciates etiquette and proper protocol and those who want to learm  more about it.<br />Also Recommended: Miss Abernathy's Concise Slave Training  Manual &amp; Training With Miss Abernathy, both by Cristina Abernathy.	2000-06-28

The second  edition of this book covers so many different aspects of web  development. It devotes chapters to new developments in HTML (HTML 4) and  JavaScript. There are also chapters devoted to Cascading Style Sheets, XML,  CGI,  Apache modules, and HTTP itself.<br />All current HTML tags and  attributes are listed, along with JavaScript event handlers. Tables,  frames, character entries and color values are also covered in various  chapters. Very handy material!<br />While this is definitely not a tutorial  book, it does contain lots of reference material and I learned a few new  tricks reading through this book.

While the first two editions of this book reflected those changes, they are now almost  completely outdated. This third edition reflects the latest changes,  describing all the brand new Internet technologies.<br />The authors'  conversational (and at times gently humorous) style makes reading about all  these potentially daunting topics very easy. And at times you become  fascinated by all the things you can do on the 'Net, like searching for a  long-lost friend, paying your bills online, or buying the latest CD from  Steely Dan or the latest Stephen King novel online.<br />There are chapters in  this book about using email (and conquering email problems) and net news,  protecting your privacy online, a chapter to building your own web page,  what to do when you have trouble getting online, and playing online games  (and avoiding &quot;lag&quot; and disconnects).<br />I also loved the  Resources section near the back of the book, which lists a number of  different web sites for various topics. The book also looks to the future  and what technologies we can look forward to seeing in the next few years.<br />If you want a good overall view of what the current Internet looks like,  this is the book for you.<br />I also recommend the Internet In A Nutshell  book.	2000-06-24

This is the question John Warren asks in Chapter 2 of this book and if you're a Dominant, it's a very good question to ask yourself. This book is an excellent introduction to the 'kinky world' some of us live in from time  to time.<br />While there are numerous other excellent SM books on the  market, John's book covers topics not normally covered in other  &quot;introductory SM books, like how to act at a play party, and taking  memorable pictures of your own private scenes. Also included are sections  on First Aid, &quot;Stalking the Wild Submissive,&quot; (very important!)  and ways to do scenes that are exciting both for the Dominant and the  submissive.<br />I felt the chapter that John's wife, Libby wrote (A  Submissive Writes About Submission) gives an excellent insight for  Dominants into what (at least for her) submission means and what it's  about.<br />This book's second edition is now available on Greenery Press and  it's an excellent addition to any kinkster's library, whether they are Dom,  sub, or switch.<br />Also recommended: SM101 by Jay Wiseman; Screw the Roses,  Send Me the Thorns by Philip Miller &amp; Molly Devon	2000-06-24

When I first spotted and skimmed through this book, I knew I had to have it. This is an excellent and informative book about HTML 4!<br />Elizabeth starts off with the basics in the first few chapters. Chapters on terminology and designing your page are at the book's beginning. I liked the chapter on text formatting and how the author points out which text formatting tags are being &quot;phased out&quot; by the W3C (the folk who set HTML standards). I'd sure like to ask the W3C why they insist on &quot;phasing out&quot; certain tags if neither browser fully supports Cascading Style Sheets, which the W3C would prefer every web designer use! :)) So now I know which tags are being phased out, but even so I'll keep using them. :)<br />Even though I'm kind of a &quot;veteran&quot; at designing web sites, I still found new pointers in the first several chapters.<br />I at first &quot;dreaded&quot; the later chapters (ie Frames, Forms and Cascading Style Sheets), because I knew little about them. However, as with everything else in this book, Elizabeth's descriptions of each of them made them sound quite easy and I wondered why I've been so afraid of them until now.<br />Another thing I liked about this book were the code examples on every page included along with the text. I'm someone who looks at &quot;code&quot; first and asks questions later, something that occasionally gets me in trouble..hehe. However, the examples make clear the concepts Elizabeth is trying to get across.<br />The appendices at the back of the book are also wonderful and are great to refer to. The entire book is easy to read and is a valuable reference tool for most web designers, be them a beginner or intermediate.	2000-06-08

I had a 1992 copy of this book and just recently found out about the updated version. Wow. This updated version contains most if not all of the information in the old one plus so much more! Once again, this book is  probably the best reference book out there about UNIX.<br />This book devotes  almost 200 pages alone to commands, along with chapters on the various  shells, vi commands, emacs, various text formatting macros, and even a  chapter about awk.<br />If you are a UNIX 'geek' or 'wannabe UNIX geek' like  me, or just want to know more about UNIX, this book is for you. It's  probably not for beginners however. They would be advised to buy  &quot;Learning About UNIX&quot; or another good introductory book.	2000-06-08

There are now several excellent books out that document the history of this league. This book, which was among the first is no exception. The PCL during its first half century signed and &quot;farmed out&quot; its own players and sometimes made money by &quot;selling&quot; the contracts of some players to interested major league teams.<br />This book describes the league's history decade by decade through the late 1980's. It also discusses the PCL's attempt to become the &quot;third major league&quot; in the early 1950's, only to have that dream dashed forever when major league baseball &quot;moved&quot; to California in 1958, and how the league eventually &quot;rebounded&quot; in the 1980's.<br />The book also talks about some of the PCL's greatest teams, including the 1934 Los Angeles Angels (who some claim was the best minor league team ever), some of the great San Francisco Seals teams, the 1948 Oakland Oaks team, etc.<br />The book finishes with an extensive section of individual PCL yearly leaders. This book is a fascinating read. Any baseball history and or minor league fans will find it enjoyable.	2000-05-23

Which in my opinion is probably a good  thing!<br />While the book mostly describes old-time major league stadiums  (complete with &quot;Top Ten&quot; lists of the most historic events to  take place at each stadium), a few minor league parks are also  mentioned.<br />Lots of history and photographs are featured with each park's  description. I like a couple other reviewers sincerely hope an updated  edition of this book will be out soon, now that so many other ballparks  (Candlestick Park, Tiger Stadium, and the AstroDome, for example) have been  replaced.<br />If you enjoy reading about what it was like to watch a game in  these old parks, you will enjoy this book!<br />Also recommended: Nuggets on  the Diamond, Grand Minor League, Baseball's Hometown Teams: The Story of  the Minor Leagues	2000-05-22

In this book, Dick Dobbins took a cue from the book, &quot;The Glory of Their Times,&quot; interviewing numerous ex-PCL players and umpires about the league. This oral history of the league is an excellent look back. Reading this book takes you back to a different era of baseball and shows why the PCL deserved to be called the &quot;Grand Minor League.&quot;<br />The book has chapters on the league's various ballparks over the years, the league's great teams and rivalries. There are numerous pictures of various players, managers, umpires and team owners throughout the book.

Written primarily from a Fem Domme point of view, the book has some interesting information. It also has some cute  illustrations at the start of each chapter and some witty section  titles.<br />There is good information on shaving, how to clean your leather  clothes, a great list of movies with &quot;SM-type scenes&quot; in them,  and chapters on knot-tying and &quot;SM yoga&quot; type exercises. There's  also good advice for getting &quot;toys&quot; past airport  security.<br />However, there were a few sections I was uncomfortable with.  For example, advising the cleaning of toys with vodka? Huh? Anti-bacterial  soap or rubbing alcohol works just as well for sterilizing toys. Also,  ripping up hotel bedsheets to use as bondage ties?  I would imagine a hotel  manager might bill you for those ripped-up sheets.<br />I also was a bit  uncomfortable with the chapter on gags. While she does mention safety  precautions to a certain extent, I would never gag anyone with tape to hold  a gag in place. There's too much possibility of things going wrong  IMHO.<br />This book has good and not so good information. Hence the three  star rating.	2000-05-18

The first chapter of the book tells how they both got interested in SM.<br />There are a number of  &quot;introductory SM books&quot; on the market now and what I like about  the well-written ones is they way they handle basic SM topics. This book is  no exception to this rule.<br />It not only covers common SM topics, such as  &quot;playing safely&quot; (with detailed descriptions of playing with  various SM &quot;toys), but also contains sections on who you should or  shouldn't play with, and also contains a book, magazine and online resource  section.<br />I loved the glossary of SM terms contained in the book and their  chapter on &quot;Defining and Demystifying the Language.&quot; They also  call make a point to define the difference between consensual play and  abuse.<br />I also liked their section called &quot;On Doing Psychotherapy in  the Dungeon.&quot; They point out SM can be therapeutic, but not to do  actual &quot;therapy&quot; in play. Good point!<br />A well-written book with  lots of good information.	2000-05-15

As with other books Jay has written, this book is full of safety  cautions and health risks related to doing bondage.<br />Among the sections in  the book include a little bit of &quot;theory&quot; on bondage, different  types of rope that can be used, different ways to do single or double-limb  bondage, breast bondage (a personal fave!), spread-eagled bondage, and  bondage equipment.<br />I like Jay's assertion that you don't need to learn a  lot of knots to do good bondage.

I would never place a  carbonated item inside a woman's vagina, nor would I want to be receiving  oral sex while trying to drive! Ideas like these, despite the author's  claims to the contrary are plain dangerous.<br />The comment on one trick that  &quot;large-breasted women are more sexually experienced than smaller  breasted women&quot; also bothered me.

The author notes that this book is a &quot;primer&quot; on spanking and that possibly tens or even hundreds of thousands of people have experimented with some form of spanking, while not being interested in  other forms of SM.<br />This book contains a lot of information in a small  amount of space (86 pages). Included are sections on establishing a mood,  warmup, why we enjoy spanking or being spanked, spanking &quot;toys,&quot;  and how to clean your spanking toys after use.<br />If you want to learn more  about being a good spanker, this is a great place to start.	2000-04-10

While written from a gay male perspective, the information presented here transcends all sexual orientations and genders and can be applied to any  D/s relationship.<br />I'm truly sorry the one individual who posted the  negative review failed to understand this. Screw the Roses is an excellent  book, but does not explore D/s dynamics as well as this book. I'm also a  het male Dominant, but I learned a lot from reading this book!<br />Well worth  reading for any Dominant who wishes to learn more about D/s.	2000-04-10

Im always looking for ways to spice up my sex life and this book provides plenty of suggestions. This &quot;companion&quot; to the original &quot;Tricks&quot; book contains lost of new suggestions which withstood  the author's &quot;tests&quot; (be safe, not require much equipment, and  most importantly, work right the first time!).<br />I wish there were more  sex-positive books like this out there. Jay has done a great job in  compiling these kinds of lists of ideas to try out in the privacy of our  own bedrooms.	2000-04-07

This book is an excellent look back at over 100 years of San Francisco bay Area baseball. Starting off with the first sandlot and then professional teams, it goes on to describe the histories of the SF Seals and Oakland Oaks (along with some of their players), and some history of the PCL. It also talks about the Giants and A's moves to the Bay Area and gives a history of those teams through the 1993 season.<br />The book is full of pictures of players and memorabilia and the back of the book lists the records and all-time stats for the Seals, Oaks, Giants and A's.<br />Well worth the money. The authors did an wonderful job writing this history.	2000-04-05

While  these are important topics to cover, it seems the author made these topics  a bit too simplistic. In the first half of the book, I found my mind  wandering often.<br />The second half of the book (where most of the above  information is located) was better. However, Gloria's mention of &quot;Old  Guard&quot; practices is slightly off. There never was  one true Old Guard  (possibly variations on it), and she makes it seem as if there was.<br />I  also noticed in the Resource section that no mention is made of the book  SM101 by Jay Wiseman, which IMO is also an excellent introductory SM book.	2000-04-05

Not to mention  some rather hot scenes. :)) I liked too how the psychological aspects of  Fem Domme/male sub play was described in each story. Even if at times I  grew impatient at wondering how a story might turn out, I was always  pleased at the story's end.<br />Tammy is a wonderful writer, and even though  I'm a male Dominant myself, I would be feel honored to kneel before her.	2000-03-30

This book is the first I've seen that affirms that large people can be as sexy and alluring as any other group of people! This book tears apart stereotypes about fat people, devotes a chapter to communities of &quot;fat admirers,&quot; as well as bi and lesbian fat communities. There are also chapters about health and sexuality, along with a list of resources at the back of the book.<br />This book is well worth reading for everyone, large or not large.	2000-03-19

This &quot;look&quot; (if you can call it that) into the world of SM presents an individual who thinks nothing of practicing extremely heavy SM scenes (bordering on abuse) with in some cases emotionally damaged women  and bragging about it. It frightens me to think people will buy this and  assume this is what SM about! While some new and 'wannabe' Male Dominants  will probably get off on Sir John's writings, I found most of this book  highly disturbing. In fact, I was so disgusted with it, I didn't even  bother reading the last two chapters.<br />If you want to really learn about  SM, buy a book like Screw the Roses or SM 101 or the Loving Dominant, but  stay away from this book!	2000-03-08

I heartily disagree with the UK reviewer who said this book was a waste of money. On the contrary..it is full of excellent information about SM topics ranging  from flogging, Dom/sub interactions, finding partners, to Humilation and  erotic 'torture,' along with many other topics.<br />Highly recommended if you  want to learn more about consensual power exchange.	2000-02-28

This guide gives instructions on making your own  SM toys using mostly inexpensive materials. This book explains how to build up to 99 different &quot;toys.&quot; If you can't afford expensive toys or like me are just  too cheap to go out and buy them, this book is for you!	2000-01-22

Mz Easton &amp; Listz's  writing style is very easy-going and easy to follow. Any sub and for that  matter any Dominants can learn a lot from this book.	1999-12-18

Dr. Reuben says that people into BDSM, for example are out to  recruit children and that 'in its extremes, can lead to rape, torture and  murder.' These are absolute lies. He fails to see why anyone would be into  BDSM as a way to express their sexuality.<br />He also fails to describe the  love and respect shown between both people in a BDSM relationship. He also  claims that most BDSM scenes always go much farther than they should. I  think it's obvious Dr. Reuben has nothing but disgust for anyone into any  form of SM. He also is down on people with pierced body parts and is also  down on same sex marriages. He also claims that menopausel women become  &quot;masculinized.&quot;<br />I definitely recommend against buying a book  about sexuality that resorts to half-truths, judgmental and heavy-handed  information in order to make its points.	1999-06-30
