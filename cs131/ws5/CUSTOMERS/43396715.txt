That is, if she can convince Nick Farrell, the mountain's owner, a.k.a., tycoon and corporate raider, to let her dig there.  Nick reluctantly agrees to let her do so, but also establishes ground rules that Carter is less than happy with.  Carter's name seems familiar, and when Nick realizes who she is related to, his cool business fa√ßade tells him he may stand to benefit all around from this decision.  Little does he realize what lies in store for his heart!<br />Arrogant, with a temper to boot, Nick's life starts to change the minute Carter walks on to his mountain.  Using the excuse of keeping an eye on her work, soon Nick can't keep his eyes off Carter, and fireworks fly between these two.  As the dig progresses, interesting artifacts and skeletons turn up, along with an unsavory associate of Carter's, showing more interest than what seems appropriate in her findings.  Carter's dad also makes an appearance, shattering the protective shell she has conveniently built around herself, and questioning Nick's business motives with her dad.  Is he just using her to conveniently close another deal, breaking her heart in the process?<br />The associates that Carter bring on the dig, and other members of Nick's family, provide some great moments, adding nice secondary features and slices of humor along the way.  I really liked the different archeological story line, and the many bits of history were very interesting, and not overdone.  I must add, that this Farrell reminds me of another, that being Matt Farrell from Judith McNaught's \\"Paradise\\", who is one of my favorite leading men.

Young Kerry Linwood was engaged to Luciano, but broke off their engagement the day before his arrest for reasons unknown to him.  Luciano has been released from prison, and is back to wreak havoc on those responsible for his arrest, and to clear his name in a crime he swears he did not commit.  For starters, he plans to take everything that belongs to the Lynwoods, including Ballybawn Castle, and already made a jump start destroying the Lynwood wine business while in prison.<br />So where does poor, na√Øve Kerry stand in all this?  Luciano wants her, of course, but swears all he is doing is purging his system of whatever leftover feelings he had for her.  Enter the evil stepsister Rochelle, dear old dad Harold Lynwood, and one must wonder if Kerry will ever have any self-respect after the games they play with her life.  The only family member who seems to genuinely care at all for Kerry is cousin Miles, and he even leaves us wondering at times.<br />The story line is a good one, and there are plenty of probable suspects in the embezzlement.  My problem was in understanding Kerry, her undying love for Luciano, who treats her less than well most of the time, and whose caveman attitude wears you down.  As in all romances, there does come a happy ending, but all to often in the course of the book I just had to wonder \\"why\\" - did Kerry put up with so much from everyone?

With the romance and suspense so intricately woven, the emotions this author evokes will keep you glued to your chair until the final page.	2003-03-02

And when word finally comes, it isn't good ...Marco is presumed dead, lost at sea during a hurricane in the Caribbean.  Determined to find out what went wrong, and also encouraged by attorney Grayson Boyd, who stands to make a killing off this disaster at sea, Ava heads to the island of St. Barts.<br />Dane Erikson is the owner of the luxurious Utopia Adventures cruise line, and challenges Ava to help discover what went wrong with the doomed ship, rather than side with the scum ball attorney.  Ava blames Dane for wanting to cash in on millions off this disaster, and also for sending the doomed \\"Paradisio\\" into the eye of the storm.  Dane blames Ava for not being a good sister to Marco, and cannot understand why she never got in touch with him for 5 years.  The continual misunderstandings between these two finally turns into a mutual concern to put the past behind them, and work together to solve the mystery of the doomed ship.<br />What happens along the way is awesome.  Dane is one of the most engaging heroes ever, and when he and Ava finally get together, the sensual fireworks ignite.  There are many twists and turns in the plot that will keep you guessing right up to the end.  The author takes the time to bring this entire story to conclusion, and leaves nothing out.  When most books would have ended, the publisher generously commits enough pages to bring everything to closure.  This book has it all - Kudos to this wonderful new author!	2003-02-12

The past history of foreign lands entwined with today's world.  The foreign cultures and beliefs lend to this erotic story, but the basis that makes this all seem so real is the love between the main characters, for without the emotions, this story would not be the same.  I hated to see this book come to an end, and once finished, it stuck with me for a long time. The history of the exotic foreign lands and the descriptive narrative made you feel like you were there.  This book evokes many emotions in the reader as you progress to the end, which is exactly what a good book should do.  In searching the web, I have located several other books of Ms. Latow's that also feature the same characters, along with some new ones, and can't wait to read them.  Be warned however, they were a bit difficult to track down, but well worth the time I spent doing just that.	2003-02-09

US	43396715	R2F34T2JNEC4EC	0440237599	162029379	Hot Pursuit	Books	4	4	6	N	N	Great Romantic Suspense!	What starts out as a routine rock climb for Taylor O\\"Toole, results in what appears as a freak accident, government officials bring in their big gun, Navy SEAL Jack Broussard to protect the lovely mystery writer.  Seems Taylor has a link with a missing Navy scientist (unbeknown to Taylor) and someone wants her out of the way.  What started out as a seemingly innocent favor to friend Candace, throws Taylor in to the fire, and Jack's arms.  Jack is none too thrilled to be assigned to what seems like a baby-sitting job, but it doesn't take long to convince him Taylor's life is in danger.  Of course Jack does not reveal to Taylor why he is following her, but every time an attempt is made on her life he's there to save the day.  As the stakes are upped, the sparks fly between these two, and staying alive takes on a whole new meaning.<br />Making cameo appearances, albeit brief, are Annie and Sam McCade from \\"My Spy\\", along with irresistible Izzy, who is a major player in this story.  On top of the attempts on Taylor's life, another plot line develops regarding her birth parents, a difficult thing for Taylor to deal with at this particular time in her life.<br />This is a wonderful romantic suspense with non-stop action. Numerous holes in the plot, along with Taylor's stubbornness that result in some foolish choices will frustrate some readers.  However, the passion between the lead protagonists and twist of surprise at the ending compensate the reader nicely.  Nothing too heavy here, just a fun and frivolous read!	2003-02-09

Having never read a book by this author, and then finding out it was her first contemporary romance was a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />Shelly Granger fled to New Orleans from her hometown in Oak Valley seventeen years ago, devastated by a broken heart thanks to Sloan Ballinger.  Shocking news of her brother's suicide forces her return to Oak Valley, and picking up the pieces of the ravaged Granger Cattle Company.<br />Many questions need to be answered, specifically why would Josh, who practically raised Shelly after the death of their parents, and her hero, commit suicide?  Why is the Granger Cattle Company practically non-existent, and who might have blackmailed Josh?  And what did Josh have to do with Nick's parentage? Add the old Granger - Ballinger feud, and the desire that still burns red hot between Sloan and Shelly, and you have the formula for a prefect romantic suspense.  Plus all the other alpha males in this book are just too much - I can definitely see future books (at least I hope there will be) for Jeb and Roman.  The delightful secondary characters are just too good not to be brought back to life in future books.	2003-01-04

Their brief interlude is one that Matt Holt and Billie Jean Walker will never forget.<br />Two years later, Matt's son Scott arrives home from college for the summer with 3 friends in tow, and Matt is shocked to see that one of them is Billie Jean.  Matt and Billie don't share with Scott and his friends that they have previously met.  Although Scott has never been more than good friends with Billie, things become a bit awkward when he feels he must compete with his father for Billie's attention.  Billie has a lot of baggage that neither Scott or Matt are aware of, so after a few weeks she heads home to confront her evil father Jarrod, who has emotionally abused her her entire life, and try to settle matters at hand.  Months later, mentally and physically exhausted, she returns to Matt's ranch, and here's where things get really convoluted...just when I think this girl knows what she's doing and a good man when she sees it....well, you get the picture!<br />Having missed this book the first time around, and reading all the great reviews about it, I could hardly wait to read it.  And it was good, but so, so sad....will Billie Jean ever get it right? Will she ever stop crying?  Will she ever tell anyone, especially the man who loves her, the whole truth? And do men like Matt  (and Scott) really exist?  I doubt most have the patience, or the financial means, to do all the things Matt does for Billie, which is where the book borders on unbelievable.  I love most of Sharon Sala's books, the Gambler's Daughters being some of the best I have ever read. Halfway through this book, it became too bogged down with sad emotions and tears, with too few happy pages at the end for my liking.	2003-01-04

Bram Bennett sold his company to Warren Witherspoon, who then forced a marriage of convenience with his daughter Honor.  Warren's ultimatum:  marry Honor to keep her safe from her recent kidnappers, or he would destroy the economy of Bram's home town of Hot Springs.  Bram, a techno wizard turned recluse since his wife's death eight years ago, reluctantly complies, unaware of how his life is about to change.<br />Honor is bound and determined to start her life over in Hot Springs and embraces her new community, and reluctant husband, with her zest for life and refusal to be made an invalid by her kidnappers.  The quirky characters of the community, along with yet another romantic liaison between Mia and bad man Josh, add life to a plot that has been used over and over again. In the hands of this gifted author, she turns it in to a poignant and hilarious love story, where everyone learns once again the value of love, trust and truly finding home.  I enjoyed the fireworks and fun in this fabulous book!	2003-01-04

Somewhere along the line I read that Michelle Albert likes to write romances where the girls get to have all the fun.  And I would say she definitely achieves that goal in this book.  Before I go any further, let me also say that if you can get your hands on a copy of \\"Absolute Trouble\\" (written as Michelle Jerott), read this too.  It was great to catch up with some of those characters in this book.<br />Jack and Diane's story has it all - chemistry that sizzles right from the start, my favorite New Orleans locale, interesting and refreshing story line that hasn't been used over and over again - and what makes that so good is the author's background in archaeology.  Will Diana get her man?  Oh yeah...from the moment Diana walks in to Jack's office, the game begins, and doesn't let up until the end.  Can't wait to see what she has in store for Detective Halloran!	2002-12-30

There's a lot going on in this book, aside from the police investigation, as to who's responsible for the threats to Homey Helen.  We have the baseball and soccer events, the great Irish family get-togethers, and of course the romantic angle.  For a new author, keeping all this in balance and still remain unequivocally entertaining, says a lot!<br />As the relationship develops between Audie and Quinn, you find yourself rooting for them to succeed as a couple.  Audie needs a real family, and who better to give that to her than Quinn?  I fell in love with Quinn and his family.  The background characters were well developed, and were almost a story within a story.  Also, given the intensity of the threats against Homey Helen, the humor in the other parts of the story keep this book from becoming too bogged down.  Plus, the finger points in more than one direction as the identity of the stalker, and keeps you guessing right up to the end.  Can't wait for Susan Donovan's next book!!	2002-12-30

True to Anne Stuart form, this book does not disappoint.  You develop a love/hate relationship with the characters, and the many twists and turns will keep you on an emotional roller coaster right up till the end.  The cult angle had me questioning whether or not I would really like this book, but given the author, I should have known what the end result would be.  This is one SUPER book!	2002-12-06

From sexy Italian publisher Stefan to the secretaries, everyone mistakes Abby for Micky, and Abby decides it might be easier to accomplish her task if she lets everyone believe she is Micky.  Except that everyone hates Micky, some enough to want to see her dead.<br />Abby starts falling for Stefan, and vice versa.  As Abby continues the deception of being Micky, the ensuing revenge against Micky escalates.  So does the passion between Abby and Stefan, whose heart is definitely in the right place.  Add a past history of sexual abuse, a life threatening illness and its culmination, this story line will keep you on the edge of your seat right up to the end.  I found this is a somewhat emotional story for a suspense novel, but lends to the strength of the characters becoming who they are and giving them more depth.<br />This us my first read by Melanie George, but definitely not my last.  I immediately picked up &#147;The Mating Game&#148; and laughed through this whole entertaining book.  Her heroes are to die for (no pun intended), and I look forward to reading the &#147;Devil&#148; series	2002-11-10

The hero is DP's usual arrogant alpha male, the heroine vulnerable, but they get beyond their usual bickering and on to the main story line rather quickly.  Plus we get to find out what characters from past books are up to, and leave us wondering whom the next Soldier of Fortune book will be about.  Makes for a light enjoyable read in-between the heavy-duty stuff.	2002-07-02
