What makes it interesting is that the \\"subjects\\" are the greatest philosophers who have ever lived.<br /><br />Sharfstein begins with some general observations about the psychological welfare of philosophers in general.  He then goes on to discuss some patterns that he finds in the different personas.  He also discusses the nature of truth and methods of persuasion.  This covers the first 123 pages.<br /><br />After this elongated introduction, the author goes into each of the major modern philosophers in-turn, starting with Rene Descartes.  Some of his favorites (Kant, Nietzsche) get 20+ pages devoted to them, while most of the personages get around 10 pages on their biography.<br /><br />Nietzsche once said that one can tell a lot about the philosophy by the life of the philosopher.  Scharfstein takes this to heart and briefly examines aspects of each individual's philosophy via the lens of their lives.  He examines different aspects such as their childhoods (and the relationship they had w/their parents), their relationships with women as well as major life / traumatic events.  All factor in to influencing how a philosopher thinks.<br /><br />If you want a good book that deals with the psychological factors of philsophers, this is a great place to start.  Sharfstein does not over-play his hand and I found his commentary to be insightful and reasonable.  This is a very well thought-out book.	2005-09-04

This book did not really tell me a whole lot that I didn't already know.  Why, then, did I give it 5 stars (you ask)?  Well, it's because I know a great many people who would gain a lot from reading Levine's book.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the people who would benefit the most from this book are also the least likely to read it.  Most of the people I know who are guilty of the most egregious social practices that Levine details are also COMPLETELY oblivious that they are doing anything wrong.  Sometimes it amazes me how some people are consistently so thoughtless, yet they never give a 2nd thought to their words or actions.<br /><br />It is a quick read, even quicker than what it looks [thanx to several mini-quizes].  That is a good attribute of a Self-Help book.  It means that it is focused on discerning tangible problems and finding tangible problems.  Self-Help books that are 600 pages long frequently meander around so much and try to solve all the world's problems @ once.  In doing so, they many times leave the reader dumbfounded as to what he / she just read.  Not so this book.  The length is adequate to what Levine is trying to accomplish.<br /><br />In Plato's APOLOGY Socrates said that \\"the unexamined life is not worth living.\\"  In saying this he was not just talking about philosophers.  One need not have a degree in philosophy to do some introspection and learn how to become a better person.<br /><br />To that end, this book is highly recommended to the general populace.  The more you think you don't need it, the more I would recommend it anyway.  Even if you find that your life's practices are equivalent to what Levine writes, it's good to know that you're on the right track.	2005-07-09

To be sure, I am not a stranger to cosmological studies.  I have read the likes of Weinberg, Ferris, Hawking, Sagan & others.  I still found this work to be very dense.  Many of Allen's ideas I found hard to follow.<br /><br />To be sure, Harold Allen is a smart guy.  I was disappointed that the book did not offer any biographical information.  He certainly has a flair for the dramatic and likes to think big.  And, of course, what subject could possibly be bigger than the universe?<br /><br />Unfortunately, Allen's book is filled with quasi-scientific / theological overtones that many will not be comfortable with.  He also makes sundry far-fetched (if not absurd?) inferences.  For example, he says that \\"gravitation is none other than an expression for the desire for spiritual advancement\\" (p.74).  Also, \\"....biological evolution is likely to reflect a 'sharing' of available body-forms with displaced spirit from alien worlds - with the effect that entities are, in effect, excused from having a physical manifistation over most of the course of a planet's lengthy history!\\" (p. 171-172).  Huh?<br /><br />The more I read this book, the more I thought of how our great ancestors believed that different constellations were a proof of a cosmic design / intelligence.  After all, if the stars had not been put \\"just so\\" then they would not have been able to connect the dots & make out various gods, heroes & monsters.<br /><br />So too does it seem with this book.  Like our ancestors, Allen seems to read a whole lot into the nature of the universe, and infers from it a cosmic order that I find no compelling reason to believe in myself.  His reasoning & methods are very fancy, yes, but the bottom line seems to be the same.  He seems to have it backwards;  the intelligence in the universe is our looking out into it, not the universe looking back at us.<br /><br />Allen also attempts to parlay into some radical notions such as reincarnation and a revision of the (supposedly dead?) Steady State theory.  While some of his mind-puzzles are interesting, I still can't follow where he seems to want to lead me.<br /><br />All in all, I would recommend this book to persons who are either Die Hard fans of cosmology and / or people who are inclined towards books that break down the barriers (be they good or bad) between science & theology.  For everyone else, I would recommend taking a look at books by Timothy Ferris and Stephen Weinberg.l notions such as reincarnation and a revision of the (supposedly dead?) Steady State theory.

Beard takes us through the entire history of the Parthenon.  She details for us its probable early use as a temple to Athena (as well as some other theories) as well as its less known utility as a Christian church and Mosque in later ages.<br /><br />Along the way, Beard offers us statements concerning the Parthenon from various historical and modern personages.  Some are profound, some are not.  Some simply advertise their ignorance (such as the not-so-venerable Shaquille O'Neal).  From the vantage points of different epochs we are able to discern how the Parthenon has been seen down through the ages.<br /><br />Of course, no work on the Parthenon would be complete without examining the highly(!) controversial exploits of one Lord Elgin.  As hoped, Beard delivers in giving a thorough description of all the forces at play in both England & Greece.  She does not take a position on the issue, so her discussion of this sensitive topic is not apt to offend anyone. Then again, since she refrains from taking a position, perhaps that in itself WILL offend some people?  I don't know.<br /><br />There is also a background section on the disastrous explosion of 1687.  It was caused by the Ottoman Empire using (mis-using!) the Parthenon as an arsenal.  Not suprisingly, this made it a target for the Venetians and.....you can guess the rest.  What is less known is that 300 people perished when the Parthenon exploded.  That's an unfortunate detail that is many times overlooked in history classes.  As usual, Beard does an excellent job of giving the whole story of what took place.<br /><br />If you possess an interest in the Parthenon and / or ancient Greece in general, this book is a can't miss.  For anyone who wishes to tour Greece (or the British museum in London), this book is highly recommended as well.  Even if you only have a passing interest in history per-se, this book will give you an avenue to enjoy the Parthenon & all of its frieze and sculptoral splendor.erest in history per-se, this book will give you an avenue to enjoy the Parthenon & all of its frieze and sculptoral splendor.	2005-06-22

I've always been a big fan of the SYMPOSIUM (and the PHAEDRUS) and Marsilio Ficino<br /><br />is supposed to be one of the top Plato commentators of all-time.  Unfortunately, the accolades bestowed upon him were a bit misplaced.<br /><br />The more I read this book, the more I felt as though I was reading St. Thomas Aquinas.  For people like me, that's not good news.  What was worse, only maybe 35-40% of this book actually dealt with Plato.  Much of it was typical medieval theological conjecture, with an occassional reference to the SYMPOSIUM.<br /><br />On the upside, the strongest section of the book was the chapter on Aristophanes' speech.  This I found to be quite insightful, and it dealt directly with Plato on his own terms (as opposed to trying to twist him into a pseudo-Christian prophet of some kind).  The Aristophanes chapter is perhaps worth the price of the book.<br /><br />As for the rest of it, there are some snippets of cogent polemics & insights here and there, but not a litany of them.  Many of the claims contained in the book have been disproved by our modern understanding of physics (although this cannot be entirely held against the text).<br /><br />In sum, this book is mainly for 3 kinds of people:  those who relish medieval theology, those who adore Plato and those who are huge fans of Aristophanes.  Anyone outside these parameters who is searching for a commentary on Plato would be better suited looking elsewhere.	2005-06-09

As such, it is only natural that he should write a treatise on the life of the great man known as Pericles.<br /><br />All of the major facets of Pericles' life are brought together in this edition, from his rise to prominence to his scandalous affair with Aspasia to his strategy of fighting the Peloponnesian war against Sparta and her allies.  The latter topic, of course, will gather the most interest to modern readers.<br /><br />While I have read Thucydides, I felt that Kagan did a wonderful job of elaborating on a lot of details of the Peloponnesian war that were a bit unclear in primary sources.  The problem with historical primary sources is that they many times take as a given the reader knows all the background information behind specific events.  Kagan makes no assumptions and walks the reader through the various political and social aspects that underlie sundry events of 5th century Greece.<br /><br />One of the more surprising elements of this book is that Kagan is not reticent in his criticisms of many Periclean policies and war strategies.  While moderation is typically seen as a positive thing (just ask Aristotle!), Kagan points out how Pericles could over-rely on human reason and be moderate to a fault.  In short, this book is NOT an encomium on the Greek leader.  Rather, it is an open an honest examination of his life & times.  Kagan disinters both the best and the worst in Pericles' character and foresight.<br /><br />This book is highly recommended to all persons who are interested in Greek history.  For those who wish to become more acquainted with Athens in the turmoil of war, this book is a can't miss.	2005-05-11

It is witty, the story flows naturally and it is much less sombre than many of his later works.<br /><br />The plot centers around a small German town that is a \\"throwback\\" to the days of royalty.  It maintains a monarch, although the position is mainly just for show.  A young Prince is promoted to being a \\"virtual\\" monarch when his lazy older brother feels he has better things to do with his time than be king.<br /><br />The Prince, then, does his best to use his \\"exalted\\" (albeit symbolic) position to better the quality of life of his people.  Unfortunately, the financial ministers of the kingdom are incompetent enough to make the ENRON executives proud with their mis-dealings.<br /><br />For a refreshing look back at 19th (and perhaps early 20th) century Germany, this is a truly wonderful book.  Mann's prose is exquisite and he always manages to poke fun at \\"royalty\\" in the most subtle ways.  So, if you're looking for a fairy tale for grownups, the great Thomas Mann just MIGHT be the place to look!	2005-05-01

In Plutarch we gaze at history through the lens of the great avatars of history.  This is actually preferable in many ways to Plutarch's original organization.  As Plutarch's method was to teach on ethics via the lives of great men, he would write parallel lives of famous Greeks & Romans.  Many times the similarities would be stretched and occasionally merely artifical.<br /><br />Penguin Classics has broken up Plutarch's LIVES into several different books, each focused on a particular historical genre.  The current one places its emphasis on Athens.  The book covers 7 Athenians (Solon, Themistocles, Aristides, Cimon, Pericles, Nicias, Alcibiades), 1 mythological figure (Theseus) and 1 Spartan (Lysander).<br /><br />The inclusion of Lysander is due to the fact that Lysander was the primary instrument by which the Spartans conquered the Athenians in 404BCE.  Athens would never again be a major player on the world stage, so the section on Lysander's life is one of transitions.<br /><br />All of the essays in this book are the standard by which contemporary historians write on the world of ancient Greece.  That makes this book a must for persons who are even remotely interested in classical history.  Even if you were to only read one book on the Greeks, this one might be the one to grab.  The book is THAT influential.	2004-10-11

Nor is it written by someone who is offering idle speculation from the outside on what he believes the SEALS are all about.  Instead, Gary Stubblefield has had a distinguished career as a SEAL himself, and there is no better qualified person to tell their story.<br /><br />During my time in the Navy I had a few acquaintences who were SEALS.  I had expected Special Forces types to be very pompous and always looking to start trouble and \\"mix it up\\" with regular sailors in order to validate SEAL superiority.  The reality of the matter was quite different.  The contact I had with these people surprised me as I found them to be very down-to-earth, soft spoken and not out to toot their own foghorn.<br /><br />Stubblefield brings that same sort of insouciance in the present book.  This is not a collection of exagerrated war stories, but rather a detailed explanation of what REALLY happened during sundry covert operations.  He tells it like it is, both the glamorous attributes to being a SEAL as well as the not-so-glamorous ones.  Stubblefield does not paint himself as any kind of war hero, but by the end of the book the reader cannot help but have an immense appreciation for his career.<br /><br />The author does a very good job of painting a realistic picture of the SEALS; both their strengths as well as their weaknesses.  He dispels rumors and myths about the SEALS and concentrates on projecting an accurate representation of what the life of a SEAL is like.  Are SEALS one of the most elite fighting forces on the planet?  Certainly.  Are they invincible military demi-gods?  No.  Stubblefield presents many fatal examples of instances where higher-ups in the chain-of-command treated SEALs as the latter.<br /><br />This book is highly recommended for anyone who wishes to have an inside glimpse at this prestigious organization.  Also, anyone who has a general interest in Special Forces will find plenty in this book worth pondering as well.

As Sparta was a closed society, not a whole lot is known about how the men lived, and even less is known about its female denizens. The sparse availability of primary sources on Spartan women makes any study of them rather difficult.<br /><br />Sarah Pomeroy has consolidated just about everything we know, we think we know as well as what we might hypothosize about knowing about the lady Spartans.  This book is a well-researched treatise on what their lives were, or at least could have been like some 2,500 years ago.<br /><br />Ironically enough for a militaristic state, Spartan women enjoyed myriad freedoms and rights that were denied basically all other women of the classical age.  As we look in hindsight, these factors weigh in to give them much more historical interest than women in other Greek city states.  Pomeroy does an excellent job of delineating these various traits that separated them from alternative Greek social norms.<br /><br />This book is highly recommended for both aficionados as well as persons interested in historical women's studies.  Either way, this text has a wealth of information that will elucidate the lives of both Spartan women as well as Spartan men.	2004-07-26

Not so, says Sun Tzu.  The present text is perhaps even more relevant today than when the master put pen to scribe.<br />The best generals throughout history (Alexander, Hannibal, Caesar, Napoleon, Lee, Patton) have all either innately grasped the lessons of this book, or they have learned by reading from the master.  The worst generals, on the other hand (Nicias, Crassus, Hooker, Burnside) have been oblivious to Sun Tzu's teachings - and more often than not they paid dearly for their shortcomings.<br />Much of THE ART OF WAR is straightforward.  Some of it even falls under the category of common sense.  Amazingly, even the most rudimentary instructions have been ignored by military leaders down through the ages.<br />If, perhaps, there is one single &quot;golden&quot; rule of warfare that Sun Tzu would ultimately allude to, it is this:  warfare is a complicated business.  Do not enter into it without thinking through what it is you wish to accomplish by going to war.  Do not go into combat half-cocked, and don't rely on half-baked plans or half-wit generals.<br />The penalty for not following this dictum could very well be either your annihilation or the financial and materiel ruin of your society.  For further elaboration on this point I will defer you to the Chinese sage himself.<br />Given the amount of information rendered by this book, it is a surprisingly quick read.  As a bonus, we are also able to peruse the trenchant commentary of various other Chinese military persons.<br />This book is, quite simply, a must for the military historian - both amateur &amp; professional.  I would hope that it is standard reading for all major war colleges in my country.  While the instruments of war change over the centuries, the rules of war remain constant.	2004-07-07

By far &amp; away he is the premiere authority in the world on all things Spartan.  He is the primary Hellenist that other scholars use to quote in their works.<br />With that in mind, it is natural that Cartledge would be the preferred choice to write a mainstream book about the history of the Spartans.  That, in fact, is precisely what he has done with the present study.  This is by far the most accessible works in the Cartledge canon;  prior knowledge of Greek history is not necessary to engage the text.<br />By the same token, what must be remembered is that this is an overview of Lacedamon history.  While most everyone will learn a great deal from this work (whether they possess an understanding of classical history or not), I would nevertheless recommend other works by Cartledge for those who wish to dig deeper into the Spartan archives.  SPARTAN REFLECTIONS would be a good place to start.<br />One of the few beefs I have w/the present work is that the author tends to skip around chronologically quite a bit.  While not a serious impediment for one to decide against purchasing this book, it nevertheless can get a wee bit annoying.<br />Possibly the very best attribute of this work is that it gives a balanced portrayal of the ancient Lacedamons.  It is easy for we moderns to have an enormous admiraton for their military prowess and at the same time be mortified by the reprehensible way in which they treated their slaves (Helots).<br />Both of these reactions are all too human.  Some authors have concentrated soley on the one while neglecting the other.  Cartledge, on the other hand, strikes a nice Aristotelian Golden Mean.  He does not deify the Spartans, nor does he demonize them.  Rather, he simply tells us of their history the way it really happened.<br />If you're looking for an introductory book on Spartan history, this just might be an ideal place to start.

Beyond that, to my knowledge he is the preeminent authority on ancient Sparta of the present age.  In fact, I can only think of a handful of names that would qualify as being in his class.<br />The present book is a compilation of essays that Cartledge wrote during various times during his intellectual career.  Cartledge engages sundry enduring questions that the in inquisitor of Spartan history is apt to have.<br />Some of the topics covered include the Laconian approach to slavery, homosexuality, the art of war, the duel kingship concept, the idea of the egalitarian citizen, the position and treatment of Lacedamon women as well as the AGOGE [i.e.:  public education] of young Spartan males.<br />Through it all, Cartledge attempts an elucidation between what Sparta was &quot;really&quot; like and what he liked to call the Spartan &quot;mirage&quot; would have outsiders believe.  The latter was how Sparta wished to project herself to all other Greek city states.<br />The present text is far easier to read than his SPARTA AND LACONIA (which was his doctoral dissertation presented in book form).  Nevertheless, it would be prudent for the reader to have at least some familiarity with the Homeric epics as well as Herodotus and Thucydides.  If you're able to grasp some of the inferences Cartledge makes, you'll be fine.  If not, you might get lost.<br />This is a book that should be read by all graduate and undergraduate classrooms where the course is has in mind a focus on ancient Sparta.  If Sparta is what you're interested in, then Cartledge is whom you should be reading.  He really is that good.	2004-04-25

After finally reading it, it appears that reason for its considerable attention lies in the fact that it's likely the first ghost story NOT to be taken @ face value.<br />Instead of a straightforward story, the reader is introduced to a plot-line as seen thru the eyes of an ostensibly unstable persona. Whether the ghosts are real or just figments of her mis-guided imagination are topics left open to interpretation. Unexpectedly, the story casually alludes to elements of eroticism, paranoia and severe anxiety.<br />The story itself is beautifully written. That James was a master of elegant prose is without question. The style of his prose may seem a bit odd (and perhaps \\"thick\\") to the modern reader, but one has to admire his manipulation of the language.<br />For those who enjoy a good ghost story where everything may not be as it seems, this book is highly recommended.	2003-12-21

It covers a broad array of topics concerning the ancient Spartans, from their emergence onto the world-historical stage to their ultimate decline at the Battle of Leuctria in 371BCE.  Along the way we learn about their customs, the male educational system (the Agoge), their economic base, the subjection of the Helots, their relations with other Greek states and much more.<br />The present book is a collection of essays that cover all of these topics and more.  The authors are among the foremost scholars of ancient Sparta in the world.  The conglomerate of historians include Paul Cartledge, G.E.M. de Ste Croix and A. Andrewes, among others.<br />While the book is basically written for the novice and serious classical history buff alike, it would nonetheless be prudent to have some degree of familiarity with the Spartans prior to turning the front cover.  Those persons who pick this up without any prior knowledge of Spartan history will be apt to get lost.<br />This book is highly recommended for people who have a basic understanding of Laconian history.

There are likely to be many readers out there who were dismayed at the conclusion of this text as it is incomplete.  Of course, this is not the great historian's fault;  he died while writing his epic historical treatise.<br />Enter Xenophon.  He picks up almost right where Thucydides leaves off and traces the murky Grecian politics over the next 40 years or so, after which time Thebes would assert herself as the foremost power in the Greek world.<br />Along the way, Xenophon painfully recounts the demise of his beloved Spartans.  His distaste for the Thebans is readily evident, and one must weigh the veracity of some of his descriptions of  battles against his inherent Laconian prejudice.  Rex Warner, the translator, does an excellent job of point out specific places where modern scholars have called into question Xenophon's honesty as well as his aptitude as an historian.<br />Nevertheless, for all the Xenophon-bashing that the 20th century has accrued, I still firmly believe he is well worth reading.  He is one of the very few primary sources that we have for the demise of Alcibiades, the disastrous 30 Tyrants of Athens, the campaigns of King Agesilaus, the decisive battle of Leuctra and so much more.

The title gives away the fact that this isn't just ANY murder mystery.  It takes place during the days of the Manhattan Project.  A security guard is murdered, and an outsider is \\"brought in\\" to discern the situation.<br />The big twist is that Army intelligence does not care so much who murdered the guard.  Rather, the $60,000 question is WHY he was whacked.  Was he simply mugged, as it would appear?  Or did it have something to do with the security of the project?  That's what the protagonist, Connolly, is there to find out.  And fast!<br />The plot of the book takes a backseat to the historical setting.  Kanon does a wonderful job of interweaving the goings-on of Los Alamos.  The fictional character of Connolly interacts wonderfully with figures such as General Leslie Groves and the famous physicists involved in the Top-Secret Project.  Legendary names such as Robert Oppenheimer, Edward Teller, Enrico Fermi, Hans Bethe, Richard Feynman and a few others enter into the pages of the story.<br />This book that is highly recommended to anyone who is even vaguely interested in the Manhattan Project - whether they like \\"murder mysteries\\" or not.  The ethics of making & using the bomb, the political polemics of Communism, the almost paranoia for secrecy @ Los Alamos & brief glimpses of the \\"gadget's\\" scientists are all enclosed within this book.<br />Although the story is fiction, I can't imagine Los Alamos during the mid-1940s being much different than the way in which Kanon describes it in his novel.  I can think of no greater compliment to give a work of historical fiction.	2003-06-17

After finally reading it, it appears that reason for its considerable attention lies in the fact that it's likely the first ghost story NOT to be taken @ face value.<br />Instead of a straightforward story, the reader is introduced to a plot-line as seen thru the eyes of an ostensibly unstable persona.   Whether the ghosts are real or just figments of her mis-guided imagination are topics left open to interpretation.  Unexpectedly, the story casually alludes to elements of eroticism, paranoia and severe anxiety.<br />The story itself is beautifully written.  That James was a master of elegant prose is without question.  The style of his prose may seem a bit odd (and perhaps \\"thick\\") to the modern reader, but one has to admire his manipulation of the language.<br />For those who enjoy a good ghost story where everything may not be as it seems, this book is highly recommended.	2003-05-07

The historical significance of myriad passages in Homer are discussed and elaborated on.  One cannot but stand in awe of Finley's perspicuity in deciphering the historical importance of even the minutest details.<br />This is a superb reference guide to assist one's journey thru the archaic but wonderous historical niche of the ancient Greeks.  For those who have already read the works of Homer, the  present work is a very useful tool to examine more closely the subtle information provided in even the most remote passages of the epics.<br />This book is highly recommended to anyone who has ever read Homer, as well as anyone who would ever like to.  For students of Greek history and literature, this one is a can't miss!	2003-05-07

I never knew just how much clandestine activities occupied their time until reading this book.  Of all of the military history books I've ever read, this one was the biggest eye-opener.<br />The book details the story of the submarine in the U.S. Navy for the duration of the Cold War.  It picks up shortly after WWII with some of the very first &quot;spy&quot; subs and it carries thru all the way to the end of the standoff in the early 1990s.  The book is filled with detailed information (much of it  only recently declassified) on submarine trackings, submarine sinkings, underwater collisions, cable wire-tappings and much more.<br />One of the best features of the work is that it explores the risks and exploits of the submarine force from the personal, military, political, legal, scientific and ethical realms.  We are not only offered the stories of these sailors' accomplishments, but we're also given a snapshot of who these brave men are / were.  Anecdotes are plentiful and are inclusive of everyone from the legendary Hyman Rickover all the way down to the lowliest E-1s.<br />This book is a must for all military history buffs - particularly navy / submarine aficionados.  It's well written, difficult to set down and is a wonderful introduction to the cloak-and-dagger world of submarine surveillance and espionage.  If you want to know what REALLY happens beneath the blue curtain, then this is the book for you!	2003-05-03

His erudition of this culture is unmatched and the bibliography of this book is quite a read in-itself.<br />In this work Cartledge undertakes the massive task of tracing the history of Lacedamon from 1300-362BCE.  In other words, right around the time of the mythical / quasi-historical Trojan war (1283BCE) down to the time of the decisive Spartan defeat @ the battle of Leuctra (371BCE).<br />The reader should be advised that the opening stanzas of this book are difficult to follow.  Cartledge casually alludes to endless archeological digs all over Laconia at such a rapid pace that it's apt to make the reader feel like it's information overload.  While grad students in archeology and anthropology might feel right at home, the rest of us may feel a bit lost.<br />When Cartledge arrives in the more familiar historical territory of Herodotus and Thucydides the book seems to improve a great deal.  At least for me, anyway.  The exegesis of historical records has always been easier for me to comprehend than the interpretation of pre-literate societal structures.<br />One of the highlights of the book is Cartledge's discussion of the 3 classes of Spartans (Homoioi, Perioikoi &amp; Helot).  I had some degree of knowledge of the Homoioi &amp; Helots before reading this work, but virtually no understanding of the Perioikoi.  Thanks to his chapter on these people I now have a much better comprehension.<br />I would recommend this book only to those who have an ambitious yearning to understand the history of the Spartans.  For those who would rather have a more concise and slightly more reader-friendly work I would recommend A HISTORY OF SPARTA 950-192 by W.G. Forrest (ASIN: 0393004813).  Forrest's book also goes a few hundred years past Leuctra while the present book does not.<br />Also, it is imperative that prior to reading the present text that the reader first peruse Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon &amp; a little Plutarch mixed in wouldn't hurt.  I do not think it prudent for someone to undertake the present work without at least a working knowledge of the primary sources.t the reader first peruse Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon &amp; a little Plutarch mixed in wouldn't hurt.

While all of these things are certainly important, what sometimes gets lost is what the routines of life were like for &quot;ordinary&quot; denizens of the remote past.<br />Enter Lionel Casson.  In this book, Casson attempts to disinter what life was like for the longest-lasting major empire in world history.  Rome was founded (according to the Romans themselves) in 753B.C.E., had a meteoric rise in power in the 3rd century B.C.E., and saw the fall of her empire around 473 A.D.  The present work details what life was like for her citizens, particularly in the age of the Antonine emperors and just before.<br />To justify his conclusions, Casson invokes archeology, the literature of the time, coinage, political &amp; legal writings, plus a host of historical anecdotes.<br />From this array of reference material, Casson sketches for us what life was like for various levels of Roman society, from slaves and gladiators to wealthy patricians to the all-powerful emperor himself.  We learn a great deal about the mores of Roman life, what travelling abroad must have been like, what the most preferred forms of entertainment were as well as how sundry religions were interwoven into their way of life.<br />One of the best chapters deals with archeological excavations of Pompeii and Ostia, the latter being a thriving coastal port during the prime of the empire.  As much of these cities remains unchanged over the past 2,000 years, archeologists are able to discern many aspects of the typical activities of its long dead citizens.<br />[It must be noted Ostia and Pompeii can tell us a lot about ancient Rome.  Being a Roman citizen did not NECESSARILY = living in Rome.  One could live throughout the Roman empire and still possess the rights and privileges of a full Roman citizen.  It was not uncommon, in fact, for full citizens to live in places like North Africa, for instance, and never witness for themselves the pines of Rome.  Herein lies the relevance of these two cities in this work.]<br />Some day, I will see with my own eyes the Pantheon, the Collosseum, Trajan's column, Hadrian's villa, the Baths of Caracalla and all the splendour of modern Rome.  As I gaze around, I will wonder what it was like when Romans stood in my spot some 2,000 years ago.  Thanks to Lionel Casson, I'll now be able to envision the lives of those remote denizens with far more veracity.full Roman citizen.

Although it WAS that, it was also much, much more.<br />The importance of this present book is that it sets the matter straight.  The sub-title of the work is in no way an exaggeration.  The 300 Spartans + the allies who held the pass @ Thermopylae protected the Greek fleet at Artemesium and bought time for the armada to mobilize at Salamis.  The importance of this cannot be over-stated.<br />In this treatise, Ernle Bradford takes us back to that long-ago period of world history.  Much more than being simply an extrapolation of Book VII of Herodotus' HISTORIES, here is a study that offers a superb look at the weapons, armor, ships, tactics and logistical difficulties of both the Greeks and Persians.  The attention Bradford pays to the minutest details of the classical historians allows him to reason out conclusions that may not have been evident upon a first-reading.<br />Beyond Thermopylae, Bradford also has brief discussions of both Salamis and Platea.  The over-all thrust of the book, however, is to put into context just how pivotal Thermopylae actually was in reference to these other, more well known battles.<br />While the parallels that he draws between the Persian war and World War II are occasionally a bit strained, it must be remembered that it is a typical method employed by military historians to draw comparisons and contrasts between ancient conflicts and those of his own day.  As Bradford fought in WWII himself, it is natural that he should use it as a frame-of-reference for how he perceives warfare throughout the ages.<br />This book is HIGHLY recommended as standard-reading for all War-colleges, persons interested in classical history and (most of all) those who have more than a passing-curiousity about the Spartans.<br />As your head hits the pillow tonight, remember that some 2,500 years ago 300 Spartans stood on a wall &amp; fought to the last man in a battle that they knew they could not win.  They left their beloved Sparta KNOWING that they would never see it again.  They were aware that their life only had a few sunrises left in it, yet this did not slow their march to Thermopylae for even a moment.  It is because of their sacrifice that you are where you are today;  defenders of the pass.

Suppose for a moment that we were able to travel back in time to the latter part of 19th century Germany.  If we could do this, we would find an up and coming philosopher by the name of Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche who has recently befriended an aging composer;  Wilhelm Richard Wagner.  Thanks to Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, we are able to make this impossible journey and breathe the crisp German air alongside this philosopher & composer.<br />The correspondence and friendship that developed between these two intellectual and artistic giants is examined in great detail by Fischer-Dieskau.  We learn of their mutual love and admiration.  We're let in on the jealousy that each of these egoists had for the other.  Wagner would have liked to have been remembered as a great philosopher as well as a great composer.  Nietzsche, likewise, would have liked to have been known to posterity as a great composer as well as an influential thinker.<br />Unfortunately, things did not work out that way.  Fischer-Dieskau relays for us the letters of rejection that Hans von Bulow sent to the philosopher;  the insults that ended Nietzsche's musical ambitions altogether.  As a sidenote you can get some of Nietzsche's piano works @ Amazon.com...P>This is an opportunity to explore a friendship that is every bit as fascinating as that between Beethoven & Goethe.  All of the intrigue of the famous splitting up & subsequent animosity, the wonderful discussions about Schopenhaur as well as Nietzsche's infatuation with Cosima Wagner - all if it is included in this biographical work.  Anyone who has an interest in either of these men will benefit a great deal by reading this book.	2002-12-01

US	51362690	R2NZVZI9P6RJ8X	0393004813	6369909	A History of Sparta, 950-192 B. C.	Books	5	36	37	N	Y	A quick tour of Spartan history	This is a wonderful book for the person who has a passing interest in ancient Sparta, but is unwilling to spend a whole lot of time doing research on the subject.  At just over 150 pages, W.G. Forrest offers a readable and informative text that gets you into Lacedamon, out of Lacedamon &amp; on your way in almost no time at all.<br />What is surprising about this study is that the author does not hold the Spartans in particularly high regard.  This is unusual in that normally, as a rule-of-thumb, historians either write extensively on people / social organizations that they are fervently in favor of, or utterly despise.  It is evident that Forrest neither loves nor hates the Laconians;  he merely writes about them.<br />Forrest covers the period of expansion, which is when Sparta exerted its hegemony (forcefully) over Messenia.  It is little wonder that the Messenians despised the Spartans, but slaves throughout history have generally not been treated well.  I am inclined to cringe at the tacit notion that the Spartans were the only culture in all of history that treated its slave workforce egregiously.<br />Forrest offers a nice summary of the influence of Lycurgus, but does not articulate very many of his revolutionary ideas.  Forrest goes on to explain how the political machinery of Sparta worked, utilizing the Gerousia, ephors and 2 monarchs.  For a people who craved simplicity, the political system of Sparta was quite cumbersome.  Then again, it was likely that way by design, so that nothing would ever get done.  At any rate, Forrest also discusses some different interpretations of the epoch of Lycurgus' life and the the dates of his reforms.  Much of this, however, will be of only remote interest to the average reader.<br />The most gripping part of this book, sadly, is about the fall of the civilization.  After their decisive defeat at the hands of the Thebans in 371 @ the battle of Leuctria, Sparta sent out a much smaller army to combat their enemy.  However, realizing that the situation was hopeless and they were too outnumbered, the army turned around and returned to the homeland.<br />I have often been fixated on this about-face of a supposedly invincible Spartan army.  It was at this juncture in time that group of warriors decided to turn their backs, not only on an empire, but on a way of life.  Gone was the doctrine of Leonidas to &quot;stand and fight to the last man, no matter what the circumstances, no matter the number of the enemy.&quot;  Sparta would never be the same after 371, and it is with haunting detail and clarity that Forrest takes us thru that sad chapter in Greek history.<br />This book is highly recommended for those who wish to read of the rise and decline of group of brutal warriors who fielded the most fierce armies of the classical age.  These were the men who created the boot camp which military forces still use (to varying extents) in the present day.wever, realizing that the situation was hopeless and they were too outnumbered, the army turned around and returned to the homeland.<br />I have often been fixated on this about-face of a supposedly invincible Spartan army.

The first \\"official\\" team was in 1884, but for some reason it did not compete in any games.  Founded as Michigan Agricultural College (MAC), then known as Michigan State College and finally MSU, here is a record of its football teams down thru the ages.<br />This anthology of football history contains the proud years from the early parts of this century when State fielded some of the finest defenses in all of college football history.<br />It also pays credence to the 1950s and 60s when MSU was a legitimate national football power.  Those teams routinely hammered the likes of Nortre Dame and the university of Michigan.  It is no wonder that the enthusiastic Spartan football crowd was used to voice the \\"war cry\\" of the gladiator army in the movie SPARTACUS.  Those were fervent days in MSU football lore.<br />The book is also full of a lot of \\"Did you knows\\" that only a handfull of sports buffs might be aware of, such as:<br />Jim Crowley, one of Nortre Dame's legendary \\"four horsemen\\" was the head coach of the Lacedamons for the better part of a decade.<br />Knute Rockne nearly became head coach of the Spartans before Nortre Dame lured him to South Bend.<br />Barry Switzer almost became the head coach in the early 70s, only to change his mind at the last minute.<br />Joe Paterno's brother George Paterno, as well as Marty Shottenheimer's son Kurt were both assistant coaches for the Laconians.<br />For any MSU football fan, this book is a virtual must to have on your bookshelf.  From the early days of obscurity thru to the glorious \\"game of the century\\" vs ND in 1966 and the victory in the 1988 Rose Bowl, the text is filled to the brim with team photos, stats and an assortment of facts.

Here is a book that details the life and works Rome's greatest poet, Publius Vergilius Maro, known to contemporary readers as Virgil.  The name of Virgil (or Vergil, as different spellings may have it)is taken from his clan (Vergilius), just as Caesar was known as Julius [his full name was Gaius Julius Caesar, the middle name always indicative of a Roman's clan].<br />Peter Levi offers for us an overview of his life, but the balance of this book consists of an exegesis of his works.  There is also the occasional nexus that Levi makes between passages in his works (ECLOGUES, GEORGICS and AENEID) and what was happening in Roman history during the epoch that the poet penned the works.  Given that not a whole lot is really known about the details of Virgil's life, this is not altogether surprising.  Nevertheless, it's still not your typical fare of what one expects when it comes to a person's biography.<br />It becomes readily apparent while reading this work that it is geared more towards the graduate student than the layman.  I thought I knew a lot about Virgil and his sundry inspirations.  I was wrong.  Most people are aware of the standard poets who drew Virgils' admiration, such as Homer, the Greek tragedians and Catallus.  Levi proceeds to reference a host of additional, much more obscure personages who were models of Virgil's craft.<br />For example, I had only vaguely heard of the poet Ennius prior to reading this book, and had no idea what a major factor he was in the writing of the AENEID.  Thanks to Levi, I now possess a better understanding of just how pivotal Ennius was in the life of Virgil.  Due to these incessant references of less-well-known artists, those who have a credible understanding of the ancient Latin literary canon will gain much more from this book than those who do not.<br />This text is highly recommended for those who wish to learn more about one of the most remarkable, distinguished and beloved poets of all time.  The book is a virtual must for those who are studying Virgil in the academic arena.  I only wish I had had this book when I was attempting to decipher the ECLOGUES while I was in college.  Levi's insights and explanations are priceless.irtual must for those who are studying Virgil in the academic arena.

It was one of the very first times that the Arthurian legend was penned in English.  There were some older Latin fragments of the myth floating around, but it's thru Malory's account by which we know the stories most thoroughly.  The most successful movie adaptation of the legend, EXCALIBUR, is based on elements taken from Malory's epic.<br />As I struggled through Chaucer while in college, I've not yet gotten up the courage to read the original middle-English version of this work (my apologies to all of the English professors out there).  Therefore, it is good that Mr. Keith Baines was kind enough to translate the middle-English into a more accessible lexicon for me & people like me.  Baines reveals the myths and legends in all their glory, and I can't help but believe that he expresses them in at least some measure of their middle-English power.<br />This is an ABSOLUTE must-read for all persons who have even a remote interest in the Arthurian fantasy.  Although the book is abridged from the original, it nonetheless contains all of the most famous characters and episodes from the legend.<br />Within these pages, one will encounter Arthur, Gwynevere, Sir Launcelot, Sir Galahad, Sir Modred, Sir Bors, Sir Percivale, Merlin and all the rest.  The purity of Galahad is contrasted with the sinful nature & temporary madness of Launcelot.  The memorable allegory of Sir Percivale's duel with Satan, as well as so many other knightly adventures, are all recorded for us here.<br />This book is highly recommended to all fans of medieval times, medieval literature, the history of Great Britain and the idea of Chivalry.  The codes of honor, the rules of fair play and the heroic ideals conceived by the knights of the middle-ages have followed us down thru the centuries and are still as relevant to the best of us today as they were 500-1500 years ago.

The book details a rough historical outline of the Spartans as it concentrates on the rigorous training, tactics, dress, social structure, eating habits, rituals, organization, discipline, attitudes and alliances of the Laconians.<br />The text is adorned with sundry pictures of artifacts and artwork from ancient Greece that bring help the reader visualize the topics being discussed by the archeologist author, Nick Sekunda.  The middle pages offer lush modern illustrations of different Spartans and allies in the way scholars believe they were dressed and armed.  One of the paintings depicts the key moment of Amompharetos' insubordination of Pausanias' orders @ the battle of Platea in 479BC.<br />For those who have the ambition to learn all they possibly can about this majestic race, this text belongs on your bookshelf.

The latter theme is taken up in THE UNDEFEATED,  THE KILLERS and FIFTY GRAND and later on re-appears in Hemingway's THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA.  FIFTY GRAND, which details the demise of a washed-up boxer, is my favorite short story in this collection.<br />Stories such as IN ANOTHER COUNTRY, and NOW I LAY ME introduce motifs that are echoed in A FAREWELL TO ARMS, which was published just a few years after MWW.<br />Tho I've never been enamoured with the short story genre, Hemingway does rank as one of the best in the business - particularly in the American literary canon.  Hence, followers of Hemingway as well as people who greatly enjoy short stories would likely appreciate this book.	2002-08-31

Here is one of those books that is considered an American &quot;classic&quot; that few people have ever actually read.  That is to say, fewer people than even the usual canon of classics.  That's too bad, as this truly is an exceptional novel.<br />Cooper's overly-formal language that he invokes for the dialogue of his characters is likely to appear stilted to the modern reader.  Also, the occasions of &quot;conversation&quot; that he shares with his readers is bound to seem a bit awkward.  However, the epoch in which the author lived was far different than that of today.  The style of this novel is somewhat foreign, but it is a style that Cooper inherited from Europeon novels of the period.<br />The narrative passages in the book are colorful and impressively descriptive.  One cannot read this tale for long without getting the feeling that he / she is out in the forest (which is, of course, precisely the point).  As a matter of fact, the novel has inspired me to someday visit the Hudson River, Lake George &amp; some other key locales described in its pages.<br />One of the aspects of the story that surprised me was just how complicated the politics were between the Indian tribes.  In truth, I knew very little about the Huron and Delaware tribes before I began reading.  Since I finished the novel, I've found that Cooper's portrayal of the various races to be historically accurate.  That's always a plus in any novel.<br />For those who would like to learn more about Indian history, this book is a must-read.  As the definitive novel of the French &amp; Indian war, the book would also be of interest to those who are intrigued by military history.  In fact, one of the central scenes in the book details the horrifying massacre of the poor denizens of Fort William Henry, which is an actual historical event.  Aside from these considerations, tho, it's just a good story - period.	2002-08-28

Here is another book of wonderful biographical anecdotes of one of the most intriguing scientists who has ever lived.  However, those who are looking for merely a continuing edition of the tremendously popular (not to mention hilarious!) SURELY YOU'RE JOKING MR. FEYNMAN should take note:  this present work does not qualify as that.<br />To be sure, there are a handful of chapters which would fit right into SYJMF.  However, 2 major sections cover some exceptionally serious topics which are hardly material for Feynman's typical humor.  One section details his love for his first wife as well as her untimely terminal illness.  The other covers his work on the commission to disinter the technical problems that led to the explosion of the Space Shuttle CHALLENGER in 1986.  These major sections encompass roughly 3/4 of the book.<br />The chapter on his wife's suffering is especially poignant and touched me very deeply.  Feynman was a man whose love and compassion matched his intellect.  I could not but feel empathy and admiration for the way he took care of his bride, knowing all along that she would not live long.  His decision to be straight with her about her condition, instead of feeding her some fairy-tale story about how she had a good chance of recovery, was both painful and edifying to read.<br />The section on the CHALLENGER goes into great detail on everything that went wrong that fateful day in '86 as the nation watched the disaster on TV.  To this day, I have not seen a television documentary cover this story as I think it should be covered.<br />I recently saw a special on the CHALLENGER on the DISCOVERY channel.  It did an excellent job of focusing on how the engineers at THIOKOL were screaming at NASA not to launch, well into the wee hours of the morning of the catastrophe.  However, what the special omitted was the cover-up and closing-of-ranks that NASA did AFTER the accident.  To me, NASA's behavior after the fact was even more reprehensible than its carelessness before the launch.<br />It was for the reason of politics that then-president Ronald Reagan personally requested that Feynman be on-board the investigation committee [a committee that also included the astronauts Neil Armstrong and Sally Ride, among others].  Reagan knew that Feynman would get to the bottom of the matter (which he did) and that Feynman did not care for the politics of making NASA \\"look good\\" (which he didn't).<br />With this in mind, even people who are not interested in Richard Feynman, but are curious about what happened to the CHALLENGER would gain much by reading this book.  Feynman explains his thorough, logical methodology and how it rubbed many people the wrong way.  His straight-forward and honest disclosures of NASA's gerrymandering created much animosity between himself and NASA exec William Rogers (who, it seems, was more interested in NASA's image than getting to the heart of the matter).  For those who are interested in further reading on the CHALLENGER topic, I would recommend NO ORDINARY GENIUS:  THE ILLUSTRATED FEYNMAN ...<br />For Feynman enthusiasts, this book is vintage Feynman - a can't miss.  As a bonus, the center of the book has photographs from his life, as well as some of his sketches.  The book is equally recommended for people who wonder about what \\"really\\" happened to the CHALLENGER, and why it happened.  NASA aficionados may be disappointed in the work as it exposes (truthfully) all of the fudge-factors, apathy for safety issues and faulty reasoning NASA used with the efficacy of launching CHALLENGER on time and preserving its positive image after the fact.carelessness before the launch.<br />It was for the reason of politics that then-president Ronald Reagan personally requested that Feynman be on-board the investigation committee [a committee that also included the astronauts Neil Armstrong and Sally Ride, among others].

It is noteworthy that Joyce titled his book A PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A YOUNG MAN instead of A PORTRAIT OF AN ARTIST AS A YOUNG MAN.  The chosen title is presumptuous, at the very least,if not downright arrogant.  However, at least for Joyce, young Stephen serves as paradigmatic exemplar of the artist.  Not just any artist, but the 20th century artist.<br />So what is so special about the 20th century artist?  Why not artists from other ages, or all ages? The answer lies in the anti-religious and contra-religious themes and overtones which have developed at an exponential rate in the literature of the past 200 years.  One finds this motif in nearly all of the major writers of late;  Doestoevsky, Nabokov, Camus, Hemingway and Mann, just to name a few.  In all of these writers (as well as countless others) one finds a great sense of loss.  The universe is no longer see as a divine clock that keeps perfect time, nor is it seen as something crafted by a divine clockmaker.<br />From this milieu emerges the artist.  His task is to transform this painful revelation into something beautiful: art.  We are introduced to young Stephen at that crossroads in life where he must decide whether to blindly follow the traditional beliefs of his forefathers, or to use his rational mind to cut himself loose from those bonds.  Stephen's name is symbolic, for he chooses to take flight from the labyrinth of religion, as well as all of the dogmatic rites, rituals and institutions of Catholicism.<br />The narrative of the book has a surreal flavor to it.  One does not read PORTRAIT so much as one drifts thru the pages, like a raft gently floating downstream.  There are many phrases in the novel that are pure poetry; Joyce's mastery of unique metaphors comes to the fore early on in the book.  The prose is rarely lacking in elegance.<br />The story will be most accessible to persons who are familiar with the socio-political and religious history of Ireland.  For those like myself who are not so informed on these matters, the editor, Seamus Deane does an exemplery job of clarifying Joyce's allusions and references.  I found both Deane's introduction as well as his footnotes to be very helpful.<br />This book is highly recommend for all persons who ponder the changing role of the artist in the 20th (and 21st!) century.  For an introduction to the themes of this book I would admonish the reader to refer to Friedrich Nietzsche's writings on aesthetics.political and religious history of Ireland.

With much of the material loosely based on his own personal experiences as an ambulance driver during World War I, the story captures in great detail the conflict in all of its horror and barbarism.<br />The book invites us to imagine all of the brave soldiers who went into the war in search of glory.  What they found instead was the endless stalemate and hideous prospect of trench warfare.  Perhaps more than any other war in the history of warfare, the first World War changed the traditional paradigms of how wars were fought and what the objectives of engagements were.  Hemingway, who was there himself, serves as a perfect instrument to portray what it was really like.<br />The plot centers around Frederick Henry, an American ambulance driver for the Italian army (a job Hemingway performed himself).  Henry is a typical masculine Hemingway male persona who falls in love with a beautiful, long-haired &amp; impetuous British nurse named Catherine Barkley.  Henry is an exemplar of the WWI soldier who gets more than he bargains for in the war;  betrayal and ignominious soldiering of the Italians in the wake of defeat.<br />The tragic irony of this novel is what makes it so memorable.  Henry, as a wounded man who withdraws from the battle, as well as the whims of the Italian Army.  However, he does so only to find that life is full of tragedy whether you're in a war or not.<br />I would highly recommend this novel to all fans of Hemingway, American literature and World War I period historical and literary works.  It is with the subtle prose of Heminway that we can be effectively transported back to that epoch of our world history.	2002-06-30

Young Hans is a precocious, possibly genius young man from a small one-horse German village.  It's a working class town that is known for its steadfast character of its denizens, but not for the scope &amp; breadth of their erudition.  Hans is the exception to the rule:  he is far &amp; away intellectually superior to his peers, and he knows it.<br />So bright is Hans that he is selected to attend a German monastery to continue his academic studies.  So prestigious is this academy that it would be comparable to an American student being accepted to Princeton or Stanford.  It is on this journey that we join young Hans;  so full of promise as well as a wee bit of arrogance.<br />In some ways, this book could be described as the anti-CATCHER IN THE RYE.  Instead of extolling education as something worthwhile as opposed to merely banal, Hesse has a far less flattering view of the educational system.  The crux of the book is found in the following passage:<br />&quot;A schoolmaster will prefer to have a couple of dumbheads in his class rather than a single genius, and if you regard it objectively, he is of course right.  His task is not to produce extravagant intellects but good Latinists, arithmeticians and sober decent folk.&quot;  (99-100)<br />Here it becomes evident that Hesse has little regard for a German pedagogic system which places pragmatism above nourishing persons of exceptional mental acumen.  Most of the rest of the book revolves around the nucleus of this passage.<br />The whole tone and style of this book very much reminds me of Thomas Mann.  The theme of transition from adolesence to adulthood is present in Mann's works as well.  By coincidence, due to the fact that they're both German authors, Mann's &amp; Hesse's books are alongside each other on my bookcase.  After reading this novel, I found this arrangement to be all the more fitting.  I do know that Mann &amp; Hesse were friends;  it appears that they held an influence over each others works as well.<br />This book is highly recommended, particularly to promising high school students who plan on attending college.  It engages one of the most horrifying prospects that a serious student faces: flunking out and falling back into the milieu of the blue collar working environment.  Of course, working any honest job is a noble endeavor.  However, we at once remember the closing paragraph of Schopenhaur's essay ON GENIUS:<br />&quot;A person of high, rare mental gifts, compelled to attend to a merely useful piece of business for which the most ordinary person would be fitted, is like a valuable vase decorated with the most beautiful painting, which is used as a kitchen-pot;  and to compare useful men with men of genius is like comparing bricks with diamonds&quot;  (Arthur Schopenhaur, PHILOSOPHICAL WRITINGS, p. 97.  Trans:  E. F. J. Payne)<br />For those of us caught in the middle of Schopenhaur's dichotemy, it is with the greatest strain that we reach for the one, but end up plunging into the other.  This is both a consoling and cathartic novel for all the people out there who (like me!) have strived for greatness, but fallen short.  When it comes to profoundity, most of us tend to fall beneath the wheel.it appears that they held an influence over each others works as well.<br />This book is highly recommended, particularly to promising high school students who plan on attending college.

The catalyst for this expedition has been Stephen Pressfield, and I am indebted to him for the journey.<br />Alcibiades is frequently dismissed in collegiate history classrooms as being nothing more than an Alexander the Great wannabe. After reading this book, I can see just how un-fair an assessment that is. Pressfield's presentation of Alcibiades is nothing short of magnificent. The novel gives the reader a genuine sense of just how bigger-than-life a character he must have been to the Athenians. TIDES OF WAR is his (a bit fictionalized) story.<br />Some reviewers have noted that the presentation of the narrative is a bit tedious. While this may be true, I think it adds to the aura of the story. The tale is handed down from the (supposed) assasin of Alcibiades, down to a boy's grandfather, then down to the boy himself. While this approach is a bit burdensome, we need to remember the epoch in which the story is told; somewhere between the death of Socrates (399BC) and the end of the Classical age (338BC, with the defeat of Athens by Philip of Macedon). Hence, the method of narration chosen by Pressfield puts all of this into a sort of \\"portrait\\" upon which we can look back on. This was the era in which the denizens of Athens asked themselves over & over again how in the world they managed to lose the Peloponnesian War. The hand-me-down method of story-telling also reminds me somewhat of Plato's dialogues, particularly the PHAEDO and the SYMPOSIUM.<br />The first half of this book, for the most part, is almost entirely factual. Pressfield's handling of the Sicilian expedition is truly extraordinary. In the tradition of Thucydides, the author captures the eloquent and fervent rhetoric of the debate between Nicias and Alcibiades. With trenchant attention to detail, he sets before us the horror of battle, as well as the egregious demise of the Athenians unlucky enough to die in the Syracusian quarries.<br />The 2nd half of the book, however, is highly fictional. I am quite certain that The THIRTY did not have a hand in his assasination. That said, there is nothing wrong with fudging history a bit; historical novels are not meant to be 100% accurate.<br />A nice feature of the book is its nexus with the dialogues of Plato that cover the trial, conviction and death of Socrates. For this reason, I would recommend that people read Plato's EUTHYPHRO, APOLOGY, CRITO and PHAEDO prior to reading this novel. Also, Thucydides' PELOPONNESIAN WAR also makes for pre-requisite reading. The novel will make a lot more sense once you've read these.<br />All in all, another fine effort and rousing novel by an author who is quickly emerging as the greatest historical-novelist of the present age. All admirers and aficionados of classical history will be pleased with what they find within these pages. Therefore, I implore you to pop in your CD of Chopin and indulge yourself in the life of one of Socrates' favorite students!us demise of the Athenians unlucky enough to die in the Syracusian quarries.<br />The 2nd half of the book, however, is highly fictional.

Here once again we have a fine book written by the biophysicist / biochemist / molecular biologist Harold Morowitz of Yale university.  His books rank among the finest science books I've ever read, and the present one is no exception.<br />THE WINE OF LIFE is another set of essays written by Morowitz, loosely grouped into general categories.  The essays were originally written as articles for HOSPITAL PRACTICE, which is a magazine primarily geared towards physicians.  Despite this professional intended audience, however, the writings contained in this book are accessible to both the scientist and layman alike.<br />Contained in this book are discussions of an extraordinarily wide range of topics - far too many to list here.  However, some of the highlights are:  the real worth of man (biologically / materially speaking), mysteries of science, the implications of genetic research, the (unnecessary) politics of funding scientific endeavors, common tactics used in the polemics of science and much more. Thrown in for amusement, the great scientist critiques the veracity of nutritionists and questions exactly what we know, specifically, about the topic.  Morowitz concludes the book with  a debate that he had with his hairdresser over the efficacy of various materials contained in his shampoo.<br />Perhaps the single most important essay is called DRINKING HEMLOCK AND OTHER NUTRITIONAL MATTERS.  In this piece, Morowitz comments on how lacking the US educational system is on the topic of epistemology.  Rather than something that should be laid aside for graduate students in philosophy and science, he postulates that it should be something that is taught from day 1.  I, for one, agree with him.  This essay alone is worth the price of the book.<br />If you want a book that covers everything from thermodynamics to the legitimacy of medical school entrance credentials, this book is for you.  If you want essays that are brief but edifying, this is the book to read.  I would highly recommend this book to scientists, philosophers and scholars of all topics.highly recommend this book to scientists, philosophers and scholars of all topics.	2002-05-06

It's brevity is appealing to those with only a marginal interest in philosophy and theology.  It's subject matter is what attracts those persons who want to find a nexus between ethics and theology.<br />In the work, Kierkegaard engages the famous passage in the Old Testament of the bible where Abraham is ordered by God (Yahweh) to sacrifice his son, Isaac.  It stands today as the most salient episode in the bible where Plato's EUTHYPHRO dillema is confronted.<br />Now, what is the EUTHYPHRO dillema, you may ask?  The dillema is set out by Socrates in Plato's dialouge of the same name.  Basically, it comes down to this:  are good and evil intrinsic to the universe itself?  Or are the qualities of good and evil decided upon by God (or gods)?  If the former is true, then God (or the head of a pantheon of gods) cannot be truly omnipotent, for there is at least one power that even he / she / it must follow.  If, on the other hand, good and evil are decided by God(s), then might makes right.<br />Enter Kierkegaard, who spends the pages of this work acting more-or-less as a defense attorney for Abraham for his even contemplating the murder of his son.  For Kierkegaard, the divine-command-theorist, the latter horn of the conundrum (i.e.:  might makes right) is the only plausible alternative open for the religious believer.  The first horn denies God's sovereign omnipotence over the universe and all of its affairs, which is utterly unacceptable.<br />So, the Dane offers to us the defense of what he calls the \\"teleological suspension of ethics.\\"  That is to say, while Abraham was acting out of direction from God, he was not subject to the ethical laws of the \\"everyday\\" universe that the rest of us live in every day.<br />That, in brief, is the topic that this book considers.  For the complete explanation and polemics of his views, this book is highly recommended.  That the subject matter of FEAR AND TREMBLING greatly disturbed Kierkegaard becomes readily obvious in the first pages.  If the arguments presented are examined carefully, it is a topic whose implications may very well shock the modern-day theologian as well.EAR AND TREMBLING greatly disturbed Kierkegaard becomes readily obvious in the first pages.

Herein lies many of Kierkegaard's most vehement attacks on his utter disgust as what he sees as the shallow and hypocritical Christians of his time.  In fact, the rantings rank up there with Nietzsche's tirades against what he liked to call the \\"rabble.\\"<br />As you may have guessed by the title, this is not to be an uplifting book.  Kierkegaard will never be mistaken for Robert Schuller - that much is for certain.  In it, the Danish philosopher (generally considered the father of existentialism) grapples with guilt.  Not just anyone's guilt, either, but Soren Kierkegaard's guilt.  In page after page he discerns how man's sinful nature is corruptive to his relationship to God.  What is worse, no matter how hard he tries, he can't stop sinning any more than he can consciously stop breathing.<br />Kierkegaard then looks up from his desk and wonders why all those so-called Christians out there aren't doing the same thing that he is.  The Dane is introspective, to say the least, and the nucleus of his thought emanates from Socrates' words at his trial, as recorded in Plato's APOLOGY:<br />...I say again that the greatest good of man is daily to converse about virtue, and all that concerning which you hear me examining myself and others, and that the life which is unexamined is not worth living<br /> - Plato, APOLOGY, Trans:  B Jowett<br />Here is a great man's attempt to follow the dictum of Socrates, and examine his own life.  In this sense, THE SICKNESS UNTO DEATH is comparable to St. Augustine's CONFESSIONS, albeit a bit on the morbid side.<br />One of the Dane's favorite metaphors was of driver falling asleep at the reigns of his wagon.  So too did K believe that that is how most of us live our lives.  With this in mind, it is not surprising that he anoints this work as an \\"awakening\\" for his readers.	2002-04-28

The universe itself is borderline sci-fi as the action takes place on a different planet, known as Krynn.  DL borrows heavily from JRR Tolkein, Greek mythology, motifs from the Arthurian legend, Halloween archetypes and some other stuff.<br />Now, all of this is not to say DL is bad.  Some of the best fantasy books out there are a part of the DL saga.  As Leonard Bernstein once said, every musician steals from other musicians, at least some times.  What differentiates the best composers is that they steal from the best.  I think the same can be said for the fantasy genre of literature.<br />The present book is one of the better novels in the DL series.  It takes place in the \\"early days\\" of Krynn - long before the brothers Majere come along.  Huma, the hero of the story, is a brave and noble knight.  Like all knights who become legends, he is sent on a quest.  He even does knightly things such as jousting.  The catch is, he does it while riding a dragon instead of a horse - a nice twist.<br />The book is certainly action-packed;  there is no question on that.  The presentation and development of the characters is also quite well done.  The lone complaint I have is of the battle scenes.  It's not that they're badly written, but rather that they're too brief.  Knaak only dedicates a paragraph to battles that one expects to go on for pages & pages.  This makes some parts of the story a bit anti-climactic.<br />A friend of mine told me that since Knaak was under contract to TSR to write the book, it had to be a certain length.  Hence the shortened battle scenes.  If this be the case, it's a real shame.  Writing a novel should NEVER be like writing a sonnet.  Placing artificial constraints on authors is beyond absurd.<br />That criticism aside, this book is well worth the read for fans of DL.  Even if one isn't into DL, or has not yet read any DL, this is a good place to start.  The story is self contained, so there is no need to read the other two books in the series (unless you want to), nor is there any pre-requisite reading in other DL series that have come before.  So, even if you never read any other DL books, I would still recommend this one.et read any DL, this is a good place to start.

Invoking his vast knowledge and understanding of the military hardware of both the United States as well as the former Soviet Union, Clancy presents to us a believable novel.  The story details a conventional World War III between the two Superpowers.<br />What comes to the forefront in the book is the authentic nature of the strategies imposed by both sides in the war.  The deployment and use of sundry weapons is very logical, and Clancy's thorough familiarity with the aresnals form a solid foundation on which to wager which weapons system would win out when each is set against the counterpart of its adversary.<br />The battle scenes (of which there are many) are well written and hold the reader's attention with their gripping detail of the action.  While not as graphic as other war novels I've read, the diction is nonetheless sufficiently gory to remind the reader of what serious business war is - in any age.<br />If you're interested in a credible book on what a conventional WWIII would look like, I doubt if there's a better novel out there than this one.  Everything from descriptions of the battle landscapes to the disturbing thoughts by the Soviets to go ahead &amp; use their nuclear missiles is all finely and meticulously crafted.  It's Clancy at his very best.	2002-03-24

Particularly since September 11 2001, the thought of a nuclear weapon landing in the hands of a fanatical and irresponsible terrorist organization or 3rd world country has been a sobering and hideous thought.  Sadly, it is nowadays a far more realistic scenario than it was when this book was written.<br />In the story, Clancy brings back his C.I.A. hero Jack Ryan for one last hurrah.  In this case, it's the biggest \\"hurrah\\" of Ryan's career, as his mission is nothing short of saving the planet.  Some nasty Arab terrorists have in mind to blow up the Superbowl with the efficacy of starting World War III (believing the U.S. would automatically think it was under attack by the Soviet Union and \\"counter-attack\\", which would leave the Soviet Union no choice but to.........well, you know).  Ryan is the one person who stands a chance to foil the plan of the terrorists.<br />As is the case with other Clancy novels, the author's knowledge of military technology is uncanny.  Moreover, his books point out some of the idiosyncrasies of military life, such as the general degree of animosity that exists between officers & enlisted men.  Supposedly, Clancy developed a lot of his ideas on these accurate portrayals in his novels by hanging out at the bars outside of Pax River naval station & discoursing with the enlisted sailors. Nevertheless, I have difficulty believing that Clancy was never in the armed services himself. His stories are just SO real. Being a former Navy man myself, I find the degree of authenticity in his books very refreshing.<br />If you're a fan of Tom Clancy, military novels, or thinking about the unthinkable, here is a book for you.  Is a nice combination of cloak-and-daggar C.I.A. work and military espionage.  It is also worth mentioning that Congress has called into question whether or not classified information re: advanced hardware and the techniques of spy games were somehow leaked to Clancy.  [For the record, Clancy claims that all information in his books may be found on the internet and in books].  Suffice to say, one does not have to worry about lack of realism being an issue when Congress finds it incumbent upon them to summon him for questioning.books may be found on the internet and in books].

Ever wonder what it would be like to be a legionaire of the Roman empire at the height of her power?  Of course you have!  Otherwise, you wouldn't be reading this review.  Well, look no further; this novel should be enough to satisfy your curiousity...for awhile at least.<br />Here is a story of military initiations and rites-of-passage, heroism and the magnificent grandeur of the single most long-lasting empire in world history.  The story is complete with graphic battle scenes, Julius Caesar's lost treasure, conspiracy theories (ancient Rome was never short on those), deceit, betrayal and edge-of-your-seat excitement.<br />The story takes place in & around the year A.D. 42 during the reign of Claudius.  The narrative takes place right at the crux when the emperor is about to send his beloved forces abroad to invade England.  In the tale we are also privileged to encounter the likes of 3 people who will \\"wear the purple\\" for Rome in the future: Vitellius, Vespasian and Titus.  Scarrow does an excellent job of contrasting the despotic temperment of Vitellius with the noble & distinguished Vespasian.  Titus is too young in the novel to be anything but a cute little tyke.<br />As a sidenote:  It is no wonder that Vetellius was slain in A.D. 69 after only being in command a few months (the year of 4 emperors).  No mystery that Vespasian was much more well-liked by his men, which caused his reign to last 10 years.  He also died peacefully - something quite profound for an ruler of Rome.<br />Back to the story:  if you're looking for a captivating military history novel, you would be hard-pressed to do better than this one. As a professor of classical history, Scarrow's expertise makes him a perfect candidate to write a book such as this.  For glory, for nobility, for honor, FOR ROME!!!<br />For those who would like to learn more about the Roman legions, as well as their invasion of Britain, I would recommend LEGIONS OF ROME (ASIN: 6305534632).

In this book, the astute historical mind of Michael Grant focuses on 37 of the most pivotal and influential Greeks of the classical age.  The book starts with the heroes of the Persian War (Miltiades, Themosticles, Pausanias, etc) and ends at the very border of the rise of Macedon and the beginning of the Hellenic age (Aristotle, Demosthenes).<br />In between, Grant offers us a comprehensive look at personages who filled in all of the occupations that were of the utmost importance to the ancient Greeks.  These include military leaders (Miltiades, Themostocles, Cimon, Epaminondas, Pausanias, Lysander, etc), orators / politicians (Pericles, Pindar, Dionysius I, Archytas, Demosthenes, etc), philosophers (Parmenides, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle), playwrights (AEschylus, Sophocles, Euripedes, Aristophanes), historians (Herodotus, Thucydides) and architects / artisians (Polygnotus, Polyclitus, Ictinus, Phidias, etc).<br />In all of these mini-biographies, Grant maintains his usual standard of excellence in pointing out the most salient aspects of their historical importance and sundry accomplishments.  Grant is spectacular in demonstrating his immense erudition and knowledge of the ancient world.<br />One of the nice features of this books is its format:  it is composed of 37 seperate essays, + a  number of appendices on various topics.  Therefore, you can read an essay & then let the book sit for weeks or months w/out sacrificing anything. So, that makes it a great book to have \\"at the ready\\" in places where you may need to kill some time by having a book in-hand.<br />I would highly recommend this book for people who have an interest in ancient Greece, but do not @ present know too much about it.  This book is an excellent introduction to that epoch.  For the classical scholar / student, this book is an absolutely indispensable reference.	2002-02-19

Trying to describe it is a bit of a perplexing task. Probably the best association I can make with it would be Jean Paul Sartre's \\"Nausea.\\" Sartre's novel comes to mind in that it is like a snapshot of a persona's life, as is \\"Labyrinth of Chaos.\\"<br />In LOC it is a snapshot of a young man named Alan Agrippa. Having obtained a substantial inheritance from his late beloved uncle, Agrippa decides to spend the $$ travelling over Europe on a soul-searching expedition. Over the course of the story we follow him as he travels throughout Great Britain, Scotland, Wales and Ireland.<br />Along the way, he meets and strikes up conversations with all sorts of people from all walks of life. Some of these people include a priest, an adolescent with an active libido, a theoretical physicist, a couple voodoo practitioners, several musicians and a beautiful & mysterious French girl who captures his heart. With these diverse personages he engages in conversations that include the topics of anthropology, philosophy, quantum mechanics, religion, history, the occult, pornography, literature, pyschedelics / drug use and much more. The book is filled with references to aspects from all sectors of life.<br />Technically, the book is far from perfect. Wallace does a great job of describing various locales and landscapes, but much of the dialogue is wooden and somewhat \\"stilted.\\" On the upside, there is some delicious names-dropping and erudite explanations of the historical backdrops of different locations presented in the book. There is also a nice \\"quest\\" motif in the narrative in which Wallace forms a nexus between his story and Thomas Mann's \\"The Magic Mountain.\\" In fact, I would encourage people to read Mann prior to reading this work; Wallace may make a little bit more sense that way. {Of course, I would also recommend people to read Mann whether they read the present book or not, but that's a different story...}<br />This is a very good book for anyone who wants something \\"modern\\" and perhaps a little bit off-the-wall. Be advised that some of it is [adults only] rated, tho. Not that that's a bad thing; just that it may not appeal to everyone.very good book for anyone who wants something \\"modern\\" and perhaps a little bit off-the-wall.

May examines the importance of mythology thru the ages, as well as its nexus with psychology and psychological theories.  In doing so, May points out the didactic properties that myths have had throughout human history.<br />Along the way, May takes a critical look at fairy tales and discloses hidden &quot;messages&quot; that we normally pick up on only subliminally.  His inquiry helps to elucidate many of the themes that we teach to our children, and hints at why fairy tales have such an abundant popularity in diverse cultures.<br />May also describes to us how myths evolve and develop over time, changing with the sociological paradigms of each successive epoch.  In doing so, he uses the Faust legend as an example.  The text offers some nice highlights on the transcendence of the motif as it was first penned by Christopher Marlowe and subsequently revised by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Thomas Mann.<br />This is an excellent read for anyone who is interested in mythology, and is a serious warning of the consequences that go along with marginalizing the importance of liberal arts.	2001-12-01

Sailing for the first time on a boat they just bought, they set off to the Cay Islands of the Bahamas.  Inadvertenly, the unlucky couple becomes entangled with DEA agents and the most sadistic, ruthless and sinister drug dealers you can imagine.  The tale is a fine adventure story of a drug deal gone awry, kidnapping and betrayal.<br />There are a few minor flaws of the book that should be addressed.  First of all, the editor could have done a better job;  there are some mis-spelled words and punctuation mistakes that made it thru from the original draft.  Superior proofreading would have been prudent.<br />Second, the story comes to an end a bit too abruptly for my taste.  Although the pacing of the narrative is excellent up until the last few pages, the denouement is a bit too sudden.  Additionally, the swift ending fails to address some loose ends that are never tidied up.<br />Again, however, these are not literary big deals, and certainly should not preclude the reader from undertaking the adventure.  If you're looking for a straight-forward, no frills venture full of excitement &amp; edge-of-your-seat suspense, this may very well be the book for you.	2001-11-04

Those (like myself) who lick their chops @ the chance to read a book about the Spartans in their prime might be a bit disappointed.<br />The Lacedaemons were never the same after their defeat at the hands of the Thebans @ Leuctria in 371BC. A good chunk of this book (about 1/3, in fact) is spent on Agis &amp; Cleomenes. These personages were post-Leuctria fellows who tried to resurrect the Lycurgan principles and traditions which the Spartans were so well known for. Both failed, but gave noble efforts to these ends. Basically, they represented the death-knell to the hardcore Laconian way of life.<br />Now, both figures are certainly important to classical history; that much is not in debate. However, confronting them in a book entitled &quot;On Sparta&quot; by a historian the calibre of Plutarch is a bit anti-climactic. Again, I was so looking forward to reading about this magnificent culture while it was in its prime - cover to cover.<br />On the upside, the best part of the book deals with Lycurgus. It was he who founded the famous &quot;Spartan way of life&quot; around the 8th century BC. It was he who contrived such innovations as the long hair on Spartan males, the Lacedamonian distaste for $$ and all things artistic (with the exception of music) as well as virtually all luxuries and comforts of life. It is because of Lycurgus that the Laconians who came after shunned all things effeminate and became such a brutal fighting force. It was also he who promoted egalitarian distribution of land - noted as his most significant reform. Here Plutarch furnishes one of the most detailed biographies of this great man that you will find. The chapter on Lycurgus alone is well worth the price of the book.<br />In the remainder of the treatise, Plutarch displays sundry quotations of Spartan kings, warriors and women [it is ironic that in such a militaristic state that Lacedaemon women had more rights and privileges than any other city state in Greece]. There are many salient quotes that exemplify Spartan ideals quite nicely.<br />If you're looking for a book on Sparta, you can do much worse than this one. I will continue my search for more books on Sparta during her heyday. In the meantime, I will have to settle for daydreams about Lycurgus.<br />I will leave you with one of my favorite Spartan sayings (this one by King Agesilaus):<br />&quot;Courage has no value if justice is not in evidence too; but if everyone were to be just, then no one would need courage.&quot; (P. 119)tic state that Lacedaemon women had more rights and privileges than any other city state in Greece].

For all Pink Floyd fans who would like to learn more about this extraordinary assemblage of talent, this is the book for you.  Schaffner takes us from the earliest years, from before Dave Gilmour was a part of the band, all the way up to the tour for &quot;A Momentary Lapse Of Reason&quot; (the recording of which was later released as &quot;The Delicate Sound Of Thunder&quot;).<br />After reading these pages, one is transfixed with the idea that he has actually known the Floyd personages first-hand.  We feel sympathetic for Roger Keith &quot;Syd&quot; Barrett while he slowly (but not subtly) goes insane.  We gain a newfound respect for the interchange between Roger Waters the poet &amp; Dave Gilmour the musician.  It is fascinating to trace  the band's career thru the years as they get along, then don't get along, end up filing lawsuits and (eventually) start taking shots at each other via their music (as in the case of Gilmour's &quot;High Hopes&quot;).<br />Most importantly, however, is attention levied on the Floyd's dedication to their craft.  Unlike perhaps 90% of the rock bands of today, the Floyd was / is not about image.  No dancing with pythons wrapped around their neck, or posters of them with Jack Daniels, or any other nonsense.  No, the Floyd has always been about a group of serious musicians getting together to make great things happen.  It is no wonder that the late great Leonard Bernstein was such a big fan of theirs.  For that matter, it is also no surprise that the Floyd was a big fan of his as well.  [You can read all about this relationship / correspondance here, too!]<br />Here is their story, laid out in a exquisite clairty and sensitivity that you will not find in other bios.  Schaffner takes us thru the ups, the downs &amp; the in-betweens of one of the most innovative and talented rock bands to ever grace vinyl, audiotape and compact disk.  A must read for Pink Floyd fans everywhere.	2001-09-30

Herodotus wrote mostly history, with a few myths and prophecies interspersed here &amp; there.<br />With Thucydides, we get the first book in western culture that is 100% purely devoted to history.  The historian expresses his disinterest in speculation about the will of the gods while turning his attention solely to factual accounts of the Peloponnesian War.<br />The present text discloses T's history, all dressed up in the eloquent, occasionally verbose prose of the 17th century philosopher, John Hobbes.  David Grene of the university of Chicago does a credible job of auditing Hobbes' translation, pointing out errors, mis-interpretations &amp; omissions in the text.<br />This work contains all of the most salient episodes of the war, from the funeral oration of Pericles (Book II),  the unsteady truce between Athens &amp; Sparta (Book V) and the disastrous Sicilian expedition (VI &amp; VII).  The latter proved to be the crippling blow which sealed the defeat of Athens.  Less known, but equally poignant, is what Princeton's Michael Sugrue would call the &quot;Big Fish Eat Little Fish&quot; oration which the Athenians deliver to the Melians (Book V) before wiping them out.<br />Hobbes metes out ample attention to each major event, carefully crafting his diction with the efficacy of delivering the desired effect.  However, there are times when his sentences get a bit syrupy &amp; are a bit long.  It does not help matters that Thucydides constantly skips around to diverse engagements, both major &amp; minor, not always making it clear whom or what he is referring to.  While it is fairly simple to keep track of the major players in the war (i.e.:  Athens, Sparta, Argos, Syracuse, Corinth, Thebes, etc) it becomes increasingly difficult to follow all of the minor provinces involved as the war goes on.  Of course, the people in T's day were already familiar with whom was aligned with whom, so detailed explanations of Greek alliances are omitted.  This can be a obstacle for the modern reader.<br />All in all, tho, this is a credible translation to one of the most monumental works of history ever composed.  Within these pages we discover the nobility and wisdom of Pericles, the treachery of Alcibiades, the violence and short-sightedness of Cleon and the effective generalship of Nicias. The most poignant aspects of the period all surface without any ambiguity; the arrogant hubris of the Athenians, the resilience of the Lacedaemonians and the determination of the Syracusians.  Hobbes should be applauded for pulling off one of the best English translations of Greek history ever recorded.as aligned with whom, so detailed explanations of Greek alliances are omitted.

First of all, the subtitle of this book, &quot;The Lives, Times, and Ideas of the Great Physicists of the 20th Century,&quot; is a bit inaccurate.  Among the 8 physicists depicted in Brennan's mini-biography is Sir Isaac Newton;  obviously not a denizen of the 20th century.  Granted, Newton had more influence on the present epoch of physics than anyone else up until the time of Einstein, so his presence in this work is not inappropriate.  It's just that he's not a 20th century physicist.<br />On the other hand, a startling omission is Erwin Scroedinger.  It is understood that one's selection of who's in &amp; who's out can never please everyone in these types of books.  However, I can't imagine someone assembling a roster of 20th century physicists without including the venerable Schroedinger.  Just my opinion.<br />The content of the personages Brennan does write about is quite remarkable.  Brennan does a reputable job of describing the major motifs of different biographical epochs of each physicist, then mixing in some nice anectdotes for good measure.  He also does not get carried away &amp; deify the scientists to make them look infallible.  Rather, Brennan fairly integrates their faults into his text.  As a bonus, there is also a brief synopsis of the history of Pre-Newtonian physics.<br />The most informative pages are those devoted to Heisenberg.  I had always wanted to believe the stories about how he tried to sabatoge the Nazi bomb effort from the inside.  Unfortunately, referencing British documents which were de-classified in 1992, Brennan nullifies those arguments as nothing but wishful thinking and ad-hoc propoganda engendered by H himself.<br />I would highly recommend this book as a prelude for those who wish to study the lives of these great physicists more deeply.  As it is a quick read, it is an equally ideal book for physicists who have only a marginal interest in the great lives of their predecessors.	2001-06-19

In 480 BC, led by the Persian king Xerxes, son of Darius, the Persians arrived on the border of Thessaly and Greece with an invading force totalling over 2 million.  Here, at a mountain pass called Thermopylae, 300 Spartan warriors + a handful of squires and allies made one of the most valiant stands in military history. The Lacedamonians held the pass for the better part of a week, slaying something like 20,000 Persians (of which roughly 18,000 were university of Michigan fans).  The title of Pressfield's book is appropriate as in Greek Thermo = \\"hot\\" and Pylae = \\"gates.\\"<br />The battle is recorded in  Book VII of Herodotus' \\"Histories.\\"  When the Spartans repeatedly repel Xerxes' stunned forces, Herodotus details the scene thus:  \\"...it became clear to all, and especially to the king [Xerxes], that though he had plenty of men, he had but very few warriors.\\"  (Histories, Book VII, trans:  George Rawlinson).<br />The text centers around a fictional Spartan squire named Xeones, the lone Laconian warrior to survive the battle (albeit with a multitude of serious wounds).  In reality, the only Spartan to survive was a fellow named Aristodemus.  Supposedly, he was a messenger who tarried along the path to Thermopylae and missed the battle.  He spent the rest of his life in disgrace in the eyes of his fellow Spartans, despite a heroic showing at the battle of Plataea (the decisive battle of the Persian war).<br />Back to Xeones.  Pressfield's presentation of the story is nothing short of brilliant.  Captured by the Persians, Xerxes orders his personal historian to record the infantryman's story.  Through the persona of Xeones, we are informed of events in the Persian war before, during and after the battle of Thermopylae.  Xeones interacts with historical figures on both sides of the war, such as the Spartans Leonidas and Dienekes, as well as Xerxes, Orontes and Artemisia.<br />In this way, the book is much more than simply a narrative on the battle itself.  We are invited to glimpse the rigid lifestyle of a Lacedamonian warfighter.  The Spartans were able to relentlessly pound their adversaries into submission, but not with superior numbers.  Rather, they relied on a brutal training regimen which instilled within their men an exemplary discipline and code of honor.  Today, it takes 6 months for an individual to earn the Trident and Eagle of a U.S. Navy SEAL;  the most respected fighting force of the present world.  2,500 years ago, it took 13 YEARS for a Spartan youth earn his place as a Lacedamon warrior (7-20), + another 40 years of military service to his country (20-60).  Thanks to an obviously arduous scholarly research, Pressfield does a magnificent job of describing for us the extreme dedication that was entailed within this rigorous lifestyle.<br />This is a must-read book for anyone who is even vaguely interested in military or classical history.  It is also a refreshing text for everyone who tires of the modern military climate where political correctness and social engineering projects are deemed more important than combat readiness.  I would recommend this book to all history buffs, anthropologists, classical scholars and students / fans of Michigan State University!

In his &quot;Theogony&quot; he offers perhaps the most detailed Grecian creation myth still in existence.  It traces the emergence of Gaia, her marriage to Ouranos, the fatherly castrations (Kronos / Ouranos &amp; Zeus / Kronos), the hegemony of Zeus as well as a good bit of neurotic misogyny mixed in for good measure. The geneologies serve as a wonderful preamble for those who wish to read Homer and Virgil later on.<br />Above all else, however, Hesiod pays homage to Zeus.  In page after page, the adulation that the author holds for the thunder god is unmistakable.  There is no doubting as to who the &quot;hero&quot; of the poem is.<br />&quot;Works And Days&quot; can best be described as one of the earliest farmers almanacs in the western world.  It is written as an &quot;instruction manual for life&quot; for his indolent brother, Perses.  Throughout the work, Hesiod admonishes Perses on the subjects of ethics, self-control and moderation.  He also writes on how to run a farm and when the best times to sail are.  Later authors of this genre, such as Xenophon &amp; Virgil, doubtlessly were inspired by Hesiod.<br />Theognis came a few centuries later than Hesiod, somewhere around 550 BC.  His &quot;Elegies&quot; give a fascinating look at the transformation of Greek life in the 6th century.  Slowly but surely, the Aristoi (the Greek ruling party) saw the erosion of its status, power &amp; wealth.  No longer were armies made up of the elite class;  more and more, armies were comprised of hoplites, made up of working-class peasants.  Along with the wartime duties went the justification (Arete) of the Aristoi's claim to power.<br />  In the &quot;Elegies&quot; we discover the frustrations of an upper-class Grecian gentleman who is forced to deal with the changing idealogies.  He spurns the thought of poverty above all else, but comes to the realization that, for the 1st time,  it is possible for a member of the Aristoi to be poor.<br />Like Hesiod, much of Theognis is told in an advisory manner.  However, Theognis is far more inconsistent than H, especially when it comes to the concept of wealth.<br />Wender does an exceptional job at translating these early Greek texts.  She also offers helpful introductions which set the tone for both authors' poems.  Her commentary is especially insightful on why she believes there were &quot;2&quot; Hesiods (1 artist for each poem) rather than 1.<br />I will leave you with a sagacious passage from one of Theognis' elegies:<br />No one is always lucky in all things;<br />Good men endure bad luck without complaint,<br />The common man cannot control himself<br />In good times or in bad.

He was much more than that, however.  The historian also covers in his writings such diverse fields as comparative religion / mythology, geography, geneology, political science, biology and ecology.<br />The modern reader may find some aspects of the &quot;Histories&quot; strange, as the text is filled with oracles, prophecies, seers and divine intervention;  not the sort of stuff that we are used to being associated with historical scholarship.  It is also difficult to discern exactly what H's own beliefs are.  Sometimes he takes supernatural explantions  / events seriously.  Sometimes he does not.  In any case, it would be prudent for us to remember that at H's time, the line between mythology and history was still blurred, almost to the point of the two being interchangeable.  It was not until Thucydides that the distinction between the two became more pronounced.<br />The most famous books of the &quot;Histories&quot; are VI-IX [Erato,  Polymnia,  Urania,  Calliope].  It is here that H details what has come to be known as the &quot;Persian Wars&quot;;  the wars between Persia &amp; Greece.  In these sections one finds the major battles of Marathon, Thermopylae and Salamis discussed, as well as the final confrontation @ Platea.  Personas from both sides of the war come alive under the pen of Herodotus.  We learn of the Persian rulers Darius and Xerxes, the Spartan general Leonidas and the Athenian sea commander Themosticles, among others.<br />Here was a special time in Greek history, an epoch which saw cultures as antipodal as Athens and Laconia banded together to fight in the common interest of Grecian freedom and sovereignty.  As Daniel Robinson of Georgetown university points out, it is not greed or an aggressive nature that causes wars nearly so much as it is man's commitment to other men who share the same ideals.  H perhaps knew that more than anyone else in his day.  War is indeed horrible and nasty, but there exists still a gruesome beauty in the call to arms.<br />In any event, this is a tremendous book;  an absolute must-read for all historians and anthropologists.  Here is the #1 place to find out how the Persians, Lydians, Corinthians, Lacedaemonians and Athenians (among others) lived 2,500+ years ago.

If you dislike stoicism, then this is most assuredly not the book for you.  That is, unless you have such an overwhelming interest for either Roman history or of Marcus Aurelius that it would offset your distaste for stoicism.<br />The great Marcus Aurelius was the closest the world has ever come to realizing Socrates' dream of the infamous &quot;philosopher king.&quot;  Aurelius was a highly educated, sagacious and kindly man whose reign formed the very apex of the Antonine emperors.  Following in the lineage of Hadrian and Antonius Pious, his rule was one of the most magnanimous the world has ever seen.<br />Aurelius was a deeply troubled man;  what follows in these pages are his intensely personal thoughts on the tribulations of the human condition.  Why are people so prone to screwing up?  Why are cruelty and ignorance the norms of human existence, instead of the exceptions?<br />Like all of the best Roman emperors, Aurelius held contempt for the human race, but he was also humble enough to realize that he was a part of it.  To read these private musings of a long-suffering, sensitive mind is riveting.  It is a book well worth reading for the philosopher and historian alike.<br />I will leave you with one of Aurelius' meditations;  one which strikes to the very heart of his stoicism:<br />&quot;Have I done an unselfish thing?  Well then, I have my reward.  Keep this thought ever present, and persevere.&quot;  [p.166]	2001-03-18

It is almost like a satire on what Hegel liked to refer to as the &quot;slaughterhouse of history.&quot;  The story is at once terrifying and grotesquely comical.<br />The rest of the stories are typical Kafka;  perverse but fascinating.

The 20th century has boasted a greater number of top-notch physicists than any prior epoch in history.  The 21st century, and any future century beyond it, will be hard-pressed to match the level of scientific genius presented by the 20th.  Names such as John Archibald Wheeler, Eugene Wigner, Paul Dirac, Max Planck, Louis deBroglie, Werner Heisenberg, Niels Bohr, Albert Einstein, Wolfgang Pauli, John von Neumann, Richard Feynman, Roger Penrose, Freeman Dyson and Stephen Hawking have set the standard for scientific and intellectual excellence.<br />Another name which belongs in this esteemed list is that of Erwin Schroedinger.  Schroedinger influenced the field of quantum mechanics perhaps more than any other single scientific contributor of modern times.  Here, Walter Moore has compiled his unique story so that all may have access to the life and times of this extraordinary man.<br />Moore's writing style is easily up to the task of keeping the interest of the reader.  He does an excellent job of tracing Schroedinger's academic career as he obtained posts at the university of Jena, university of Zurich, university of Berlin [he was the hand-picked successor of none other than Max Planck], university of Oxford, university of Graz (Austria), the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies and the university of Vienna.  Schroedinger was also offered professorships at 2 US universities as well (university of Wisconsin, Madison and Princeton university), but declined both.  Moore does an exquisite job in his disinterment of all the facts, personal factors and politics behind S'  decisions to transfer (or not to transfer) from post to post.  Moore's elucidation of S' relationship with the Nazis (who called him &quot;Politically unreliable&quot;) is exemplery, as is his coverage of the friendships and correspondence that S shared with his peers.<br />What makes Moore's biography superb is that he equally concentrates on S' personal life as well as his intellectual endeavors.  Moore gives an authentic and upfront treatment of S' rather bizarre love arrangements.  Like the composer Richard Wagner, S had many affairs with the wives of his friends (a few of which resulted in children), as well as myriad young woman just reaching adulthood.  Moore offers a credible psycho-analysis of the motivations for his sexual conquests, and  comparisons to the behavior of the persona in Nabokov's &quot;Lolita&quot; which Moore alludes to are certainly warranted.<br />Like all good modern biographies, the book is filled with plenty of pictures of the personages and locales which were integrated within S' life [including the immortal assemblage of the 1927 (5th) Solvay conference].  Also, for the mathematically inclined amongst us, the work is filled with a good many of the equations that S developed and worked on during his lifetime.  The good news, for those of us not so mathematically inclined, is that an understanding of them is not essential to a generic comprehension of what S accomplished.<br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough for all fans of and admirers of this great individual.  People who have an interest in the history of science, physics in the 20th century, the philosophy of science and the psychology of the genius will also gain a great deal by reading this biographical treatise.  Einstein once wrote S that &quot;...you are my closest brother and your brain runs so similarly to mine&quot; (p 426).  This is a splendid illustration of just how pivotal he was to the history of science.  In this biography, Moore set out to tell his story.  HE DID!!

Plutarch is one of the more reliable and trustworthy historians that ancient Rome has to offer.  After his death, the great emperor Hadrian bestowed upon him ingratiating respect and admiration.  These are excerpts from his infamous &quot;Lives.&quot;  In this book we get a historical documentary on such personages as the Gracchus brothers, Coriolanus, Brutus, Cato the Elder, Sertorius and Mark Anthony.  Of particular interest to the military historian are his accounts of Fabius Maximus and Marcellus (two of the Roman generals who squared off against Hannibal).<br />I would recommend this book as a must-read for any and all people who take a curiosity in the Roman empire.  Plutarch fills in a lot of the &quot;gaps&quot; of common knowledge re: what happened after Julius Caesar's assasination insofar as Brutus, Cassius, Octavion and Mark Anthony are concerned.  The brief section on Sertorius intrigued me as he is a figure whom I was not familiar with at all.  The bravery of the Gracchs brothers (which they probably inherited from their grandfather, Scipo Africanus) is extolled, as well it should be.  And, to top it off, we even get to find out why Coriolanus was a Mama's boy.  Plutarch's &quot;Makers Of Rome&quot; is a very informative book which covers a lot of ground in just a few pages.	2000-12-29

The matter used to (and perhaps still does) exist within the domain of Aristotle's &quot;First Cause&quot; argument for the existence of God.  In recent times, the concept's most popular vehicle has been the scientific theory of the Big Bang, based on Einstein's theory of relativity and Hubble's discovery of the redshift of (apparently) receding galaxies.  This equal-opportunity theory has been utilized by both atheists and theologians alike to justify their own views.<br />Enter Prabhu.  This is the story of a young girl who has quite a precocious array of talents and interests in physics, astronomy and cosmology.  Through her, Prabhu voices some fascinating ideas on how some of the basic precepts of 20th century cosmology might be interepreted differently than they normally are. The book attempts to discern a nexus between implications of science and traditional religions (certainly Prahbu is not the first person to attempt thus). Whether Prabhu is right or wrong, I do not know. All I can say that his notions are worth pondering.<br />On the downside, Prabhu is not the most elegant writer in the world.  He uses myriad short, choppy sentences and invokes cliches a bit often.  His diction also gets a bit &quot;preachy&quot; at times in which a more subtle approach would have been more effective.<br />However, while nobody will mistake Prabhu for Hemingway, this book is still well worth the read;  I do not want to under-emphasize that point.  A modest familiarity with Hinduism and 20th century science is recommended, but not essential.  Some companion books which might be prudent to read alongside the present text are:  &quot;The Structure Of Scientific Revolutions&quot; by Thomas Kuhn, &quot;Atheism, Theism And Big Bang Cosmology&quot; by William Craig Lane and Quentin Smith and &quot;Times Arrow And Archimedes Point&quot; by Huw Price (although I would advocate the latter only to those who possess more than a passing interest in the subject matter of Prabhu's novel).ogy&quot; by William Craig Lane and Quentin Smith and &quot;Times Arrow And Archimedes Point&quot; by Huw Price (although I would advocate the latter only to those who possess more than a passing interest in the subject matter of Prabhu's novel).	2000-12-21

Shermer promises to study them &quot;objectively.&quot;  The whole rest of the book, Shermer resorts to his background in psychology and simply sets out to psychoanalyze theists for having the beliefs that they do. Now, if Shermer &amp; friends wish to play this game, fine. HOWEVER, they do not have the right to so much as wince if the theists come back &amp; attempt to psychoanalyze them for the beliefs which they have. Shermer almost invites this on pages 236-237:<br />&quot;I am often asked by believers why I abandoned Christianity and how I found meaning in the apparently meaningless universe presented by science. The implication is that the scientific worldview is an existentially depressing one. Without God, I am bluntly told, what's the point? If this is all there is, there is no use. To the contrary. For me, quite the opposite is true. The conjuncture of losing my religion, finding science, and discovering glorious contingency was remarkably empowering and liberating. It gave me a sense of joy and freedom....&quot;<br />Hmmmmmmmm.........sounds to me like Shermer needs to be psychoanalyzed, eh? I mean, he can't have it both ways. Either way, the thesis is un-falsifiable &amp; either way nothing can be proved. To me, it is just one big waste of time.<br />The book is also filled with countless errors. For example, on page 170 Shermer writes that &quot;God and religion are inseparable.&quot; Oh, really? And what of Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism? All three are categorized as religions, yet none of them have any references to God or gods. Are we all supposed to amend the denotation of our vocabulary just to accommodate Shermer?<br />On page 17 Shermer writes that &quot;It was barely more than a century ago that the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche penned the words for which he has become so famous [i.e.: God is dead] in a book considered by philosophers to be his greatest work, &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra.&quot; That is complete rubbish. By the time &quot;Also Sprach Zarathustra&quot; came out, the whole death-of-God paradigm was old news. Nietzsche is not famous for the passage Shermer alludes to in &quot;Zarathustra.&quot; It was, rather, section 125 of &quot;The Gay Science&quot; (allegory of the madman) in which Nietzsche announces the Death of God. The passage in &quot;Zarathustra&quot; is nothing more than a rehashing of the premise. Any first year philosophy student could tell you that. Is it too much to ask of a skeptic like Shermer that he get his facts straight?<br />The weakest part of the book is Shermer's token treatment of the traditional arguments of God. In his counterargument to St. Thomas Aquinas' &quot;First Cause&quot; argument, Shermer writes: &quot;God must be within the universe or is the universe. In either case, God would himself need to be caused...&quot; (p. 92). Say again? Why does an omnipotent God need to be &quot;in the universe&quot; or &quot;be the universe&quot;? Because Shermer says so? Here Shermer advertises his complete ignorance of the writings of St. Augustine &amp; so many other theologians. Shermer seems to think that if he can't comprehend something, then it must not be true. Now, whether one buys the First Cause argument is another matter, but it would be prudent to at least understand the argument prior to rejecting it.<br />Shermer goes on to say that &quot;Perhaps, as cosmologist Alan Guth suggests....it [the universe] just sprang into existence out of a quantum vacuum, uncaused.&quot; (P. 92) Now, Guth is a professor of theoretical physics at MIT &amp; is most certainly a smart guy. However, Shermer sounds as though all of the skeptics and atheists of the world should merely uncritically accept Guth's answer and move on. If this is the definition of a &quot;Free thinker&quot; (as Shermer likes to call himself), then I feel sorry for all free thinkers. Whatgets me about this nonchalant introduction of the topic of quantum mechanics is this: skeptics and atheists have for years complained (rightfully) about fundamentalist Christian websites which attempt to answer the deepest, most puzzling questions with a few sentences of Sunday School rhetoric. However, here we have Shermer trying to answer these same questions with the atheist's counterpart to Sunday School rhetoric. Shermer would like to lead the reader to believe that the atheists always have the final say on everything, and that is complete nonsense. The criticisms of Guth's universe-as-a-free-lunch paradigm are legion. If Shermer did not notice this, then he must not know anything at all about QM (which, considering his remarkable ignorance, would not surprise me in the least). [For further reading both pro and con of &quot;vacuum genesis&quot; read &quot;Atheism, Theism And Big Bang Cosmology&quot; by William Lane Craig and Quentin Smith]. Martin Heidegger once said that the question of why there is something rather than nothing is &quot;the darkest question of all.&quot; Nowadays, even with all the advancements in physics over the course of the 20th century, that statement remains true.<br />He also tries to water down the Anthropic Principle and, like so many atheists, misunderstands its implications. In fact, Shermer writes &quot;...if recent cosmological models pan out it would appear that there are a near infinite number of bubble universes all with slightly different laws of nature.&quot; (P. 229) Oh, really? And how, might I ask, does Shermer think these theories might &quot;pan out&quot;?

This is one of the greatest books ever not written in Dactylic Hexameter, authored by one of the finest novelists who has ever lived.  It is a masterwork of storytelling which inquires into such topics as morality, mortality, the veracity of religion as well as some of the possible ethical implications of a universe minus an omnipotent and benevolent creator.  And, of course (for those scoring at home) it also contains Ivan's infamous allegory of the &quot;Grand Inquisitor.&quot;<br />The novel centers around the denizens of a small Russian town. The way in which D weaves their life stories together reminds me a lot of Thomas Mann's &quot;Buddenbrooks.&quot;  Within the story one can find representatives from almost every walk of life, from the arrogant and proud to the curious and inquisitive to the slothful and pernicious.  In many ways, Dimytri and the father represent Nietzsche's exegesis on the Dionysian, countered against the Apollonian outlook of Ivan.  Alexie is somewhere in the middle.  But one will understand all of this much better by reading the book.<br />As is the case with Shakespeare's &quot;King Lear,&quot; Foucault's &quot;Discipline And Punish,&quot; Camus' &quot;The Plague&quot; and Hesse' &quot;Beneath The Wheel,&quot; there are scenes within this novel that will stay with the reader for the rest of his / her life.  Leading the tragic, difficult and mostly unhappy life that he did, Dostoyevsky knew a great deal more about human cruelty and human suffering than the lot of us.  One can easily see just how much his sojourn in Siberia as well as his bout with epilepsy influenced his writings.<br />For those ambitious enough to experience this magnificent literary accomplishment be warned:  it is one of the most powerful texts you will ever read.  It is literature's counterpart to plutonium.  A wonderful book for atheists, theologians, scholars and laymen.  Read this book with care, but do read it.	2000-12-04

This is considered by many to be Cicero's magnum-opus of his career.  Whether it is or not is a topic of debate.  What is outside the jurisdiction of debate is that it is a landmark work in the history of oratory.<br />In it Cicero details the various oratorical techniques which should be employed by the master of elocution.  Such topics as eloquence, delivery, word choice and accessability of diction are discussed.  Each view and counterview is presented by a different interlocutor, in the Platonic tradition.  We even have none other than Julius Caesar lecturing on what Nietzsche would call the &quot;uses and disadvantages&quot; of invoking humor during serious orations.  One of the primary issues which comes under consideration is the level of erudition of the orator.  Should the individual be well versed in sundry fields of intellectual endeavor (such as the philosopher, perhaps?)?  Does the ability to invoke virtually any academic pursuit aid in getting one's point across?  Or, does this only lead to a person with an overly and unnecessary pedantic approach to oratory - one which stocklists various irrelevant points to the topic at hand?  If so, is it better for the speechmaker to be less well rounded in his studies, and instead focused solely on the subject matter of his parlance?  Cicero takes the question up at great lengths.<br />Within the dialogue myriad allusions are made to such household names as Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Pericles, Isocrates, Democritus, Hesiod, Demosthenes, Cato the elder, Anaxagoras, Valerius and Scipio Africanus, as well as a multitude of less well known names which would be recognized only by the most learned classical scholars.  A general knowledge of Greaco-Roman history up until the time of Cicero is highly recommended before engaging this text.<br />The second part of the book is entitled &quot;Brutus; or Remarks on Eminent Orators.&quot;  This is supposedly taken from a conversation which Cicero actually had with Brutus and a few other mutual friends, in Cicero's own words &quot;in a private lawn, near a statue of Plato&quot; (p. 268).  In it Cicero extols the great Roman orators of the past and (as in &quot;Orators&quot;) extends his criticism against the sophists.  He also pays homage to his own teacher:  Molo of Rhodes.  One comes away with nothing less than an awe of Cicero's vast knowledge of the history of elocution.<br />This book is a must read for philosophers, scholars of antiquity, lawyers, politicians and all others who own the task of swaying the opinion(s) of the masses.

The book contains both photographs as well as drawings, paintings, collages &amp; sketches.  Virtually all of them will trick your eyes the first time you see them.<br />A very nice feature of the book is that it also includes scientific &amp; pyschological explanations for how &amp; why our minds interpret various geometrical drawings as having dimensions that are not possible under the laws of physics in our universe.  There are many others which show either 2 faces in one or 2 objects in one.  It is fun to recognize one of them right away, then search diligently for the other one; it will appear if you give it time.<br />As advertised, this is a wonderful book for people of all ages.  It is a delightful book to show to pre-schoolers and adults alike.  It would also be of particular interest to graduate students in pyschology, physics and philosophy.  Some of my favorites are the chessboard illusions as well as #5, #54, #69, #71, #78 &amp; #104.  I would recommend that you buy your own copy of this delightful book so that you may pick out your own favorites!	2000-11-12

While I may not go so far as Richard Feynman did when he referred to them as the &quot;modern day counterparts to witchdoctors,&quot; the discipline does make me rather nervous (if pushed to extremes).<br />That said, I have always respected Jung as an intellectually honest scientist.  I may not agree with all his views, but I appreciate that fact that he is not the usual run-of-the-mill sterotyping pigeon-holer (as most psychologists are).  His concept of the collective unconscious (whether it is correct or not) is rather fascinating.  I do believe there is something to it, as these common archetypal images incessantly end up in our dreams and mythologies.  It is not by chance that Joseph Campbell was so influenced by Jung's ideas as to incorporate many of them into his exegesis of mythology.<br />The present book is my all-time favorite book that is written in the psychology field.  The book covers a diverse set of topics which Jung engages with his remarkable acumen.  Some of the issues raised are the problems with psychotherapy, the contrasts between his views and those of Freud's (which led to their falling out), psychology and literature, and the spiritual problems of modern man.<br />One of the most interesting chapters of the book is entitled &quot;Archaic Man.&quot;  Jung details the psyche of tribes in such places as sub-Saharan Africa and New Guinea. Many of these cultures live the same way today that their ancestors lived thousands of years ago.  Their psychological state, like their way of life, has been frozen in time.  In essence, they are much the same as primitive man;  the same as our own forefathers.  Jung dicusses how they tend to explain everything via supernatural happenings.  Much of the &quot;reasoning&quot; is anti-logic and extremely ad-hoc. However, Jung points out how such a dangerous and volatile envioronment as the jungle may coerce most anyone into thinking in ways which we &quot;civilized&quot; people would interpret as superstitous.<br />One of the underlying themes of the book is how we as a human race have become overly-logical today. It may be that primitive tribes may have something to teach us, after all. Somehow, we have descended into apathy after existing for thousands of years as a race that explained everything via the supernatural.  This book is a wonderful dissection of the post-modern current state.  It is highly recommend for any modern man in search of a soul.ch we &quot;civilized&quot; people would interpret as superstitous.<br />One of the underlying themes of the book is how we as a human race have become overly-logical today.

John Archibald Wheeler is one of the landmark physicists of the 20th century.  He has served as mentor to Richard Feynman, Kip Thorne and Hugh Everett (among others).  He made significant contributions on the production of the A-bomb in WWII and also headed up the US efforts to make the H-bomb post WWII.  He is, in a word, one of the most under-rated scientists of the current epoch.<br />In the present book, he spends most of his pages paying homage to people who dedicated their lives to science over the centuries.  Such venerable names as Nicolaus Copernicus, Benjamin Franklin, Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, Hideki Yukawa, Maria Sklodowska Curie, Hermann Weyl and others form the objects of Wheeler's praise.  Much of the book is made up of snippets of terse speeches which Wheeler has made at various symposiums and celebrations during his lengthy sojourn at Princeton.  For example, there is a brief poem which he wrote for Joseph Henry which is included, as well as an oration on the &quot;colleagueship at Princeton&quot; which he delivered in 1966.<br />Interspersed throughout the book are essays which Wheeler has written on quantum mechanics, black holes, cosmology &amp; the like.  These are not the easiest pieces to read;  I would suggest that readers browse through some preliminary books on QM before attempting to read Wheeler (&quot;Taking The Quantum Leap&quot; by Fred Alan Wolf might be a good place to start).  The essays are well written &amp; Wheeler uses some helpful analogies, but the going is still pretty rough.  One of Wheeler's quotes which I really like (not from this book, though) is &quot;If you haven't found something strange during the day, it hasn't been much of a day.&quot;  One is sure to find many-a-strange scientific phenomenom in this book.<br />This book lacks a central, cohesive theme &amp; the order in which it was put together does not follow any specific chronology or format.  However, I don't think this takes away from the book's superb picture of what one of the premiere scientists of the 20th century spends his days thinking about.  There are several passages in which he compares and contrasts science with philosophy as well as with the pragmatism of everyday existence.  I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in John Archibald Wheeler, physics, or the scientific community of Princeton university.

It is also nice that it is by the un-intimidating prose of Hemmingway.  You don't have to worry about ending up in the never-never land of T.S. Eliot, William Faulkner &amp; Ford Maddox Ford (although visiting never-never land isn't always a bad thing).<br />&quot;The Old Man And The Sea&quot; is an age-old struggle between man and Nature.  The persona is a fisherman who spends most of his time either mulling over his lost youth or vicariously re-living the prime of his life thru the baseball exploits of Joe Dimaggio.  I think it was Charles Degaulle who said that old age was a shipwreck;  this story is indeed emblematic of that.<br />At base, this is a classic story of what Joseph Campbell describes as a hero's journey.  I would recommend you join the old man on his heroic quest.	2000-09-29

At the outset I must admit that I am only modestly educated in the sphere  of Buddhism. That said, I still found the book quite readable &amp; thought  provoking.  However, I would encourage all readers of this book to pursue  at least a basic understanding of the philosophy / religion of Buddhism  before taking on this puppy.<br />Although much of what the western reader  will find in these pages is antithical to western thought, I still found  more than a few parallels.  Many passages will bring to mind Plato's  allegory of the cave, the &quot;Phaedrus,&quot; the philosophy of  Hericlitus, the inscription of the Oracle of Delphi and various cantos from  Dante's &quot;Inferno.&quot;  That said, however, I believe the best  approach is to attempt to engage the text on its own terms, at least at  first.  After one has held communion with this eloquent work on its own  merit would be the more appropriate time to indulge in what Hegel would  call &quot;synthesis&quot; between the two cultural paradigms.<br />Perhaps  what is most shocking in this book is just how much the Buddhist idea of  the afterlife resembles solipsism.  I have difficulty with the idea that  everything I experience  in the afterlife is a but a hallucination of my  own invention.  Perhaps I am the only one who finds that bizarre - I don't  know.  But it is nevertheless....unsettling.<br />It must also be admitted  that Buddhism is a rather dark &amp; pessimistic (if not morbid) philosophy  / religion.  The idea that it is better to escape the womb at birth with  the efficacy of reaching Nirvana is.....somewhat alien to me.  But, my  opinion has little relevance in the scheme of things.<br />This is a great  book on ;  your tour-guide thru the Bordo.  Is highly recommended to anyone  interested in either Buddhism or world religions.	2000-09-06

It is written by Thomas Kuhn, who was for decades a philosopher of science at MIT. His extensive background in physics gives him a unique perspective from which to author a book such as this.<br />The core thesis is that science can only make minimal progress without the existence of paradigms. Without a working model, science descends into mere arbitrary, usually aimless cataloging of data without any means to unify the data into a cohesive whole.<br />Over time, of course, there are paradigm shifts in which one model replaces another. It is this phenomenom that Kuhn traces; scientific revolutions. There is always much resistance to new theories / paradigms - especially by the older scientists in a field which may be impacted by the subject paradigm. Kuhn points out that very often it is the younger scientists who usually make the greatest contributions, for they are not &quot;set in their ways.&quot; Human psychology enters into the equation more and more the older the scientist happens to be; his scientific upbringing may cause him to ignore or reject anything which challenges his neat &amp; tidy view of the universe.<br />Contrary to popular belief, it is not the purpose of a paradigm to eradicate every single anomaly or instance of data which does not favor it. These idiosyncrasies of nature are to be worked out (or attempted to be worked out) by what Kuhn labels &quot;normal science,&quot; which are the periods in between scientific revolutions.<br />What makes one working model more attractive than another is the way its answers to the &quot;big general questions&quot; of the particular field are superior to its rivals. Of course, how much slack a given paradigm should be given before it is discarded (due to contrary empirical facts) is not queried in detail by Kuhn. I suppose that the determination is always that such-and-such a model provides &quot;the best answer available&quot; to our considerations of nature.<br />Perhaps the most famous line appears on page 90: &quot;Almost always the men who achieve these fundamental inventions of a new paradigm have been either very young or very new to the field whose paradigm they change.&quot; Kuhn's point, I believe, is correct. However, this line has been abused more than any other passage in the book. Minority groups with axes to grind have &quot;translated&quot; this statement as thus:<br />&quot;BECAUSE our paradigm is not accepted by the scientific community, and BECAUSE we were not brought up in the same educational environment as they, THEREFORE our paradigm is only valid one - de capo. ANY resistance to our way of thinking about things only goes to show how legitimate paradigms are ignored and rejected by the established powers that be in the scientific community - just as Thomas Kuhn wrote.&quot;<br />It is non-sequiters such as these that led Kuhn to vehemently declare to the famous Princeton physicist Freeman Dyson that &quot;I am NOT a Kuhnian!&quot;<br />This book is highly recommended to philosophers, scientists and philosophers of science, as well persons who are curious about the idealogical engines which drive science.

It is an important book for all Thomas Mann scholars and aficonados, especially  since Mann's personal experiences played such a large role in the  inspiration of his stories - even more so than most authors.<br />Heilbut  takes us on a ride from Mann's childhood all the way to his death in 1955.  Along the way, the biographer highlights Mann's estranged relationship with  his brother, Heinrich, who was also an author in his own right (although  not nearly the stature of Thomas).  We also learn of his correspondence  with such notable figures as Albert Einstein, Arnold Schoenberg, Herman  Hesse, the poet W.H. Auden (who was actually his son-in-law) and the fierce  (not to mention bitter) rivalry he had with the playwrite Bertolt Brecht.<br />One of the best features of this book is the detailed information we get  on the various personalities in Manns life which formed the impetus of the  characters in his novels;  especially so for &quot;Buddenbrooks&quot;,  &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot; and &quot;Dr.Faustus.&quot;  Heilbut also  elaborates on the well-known passion that the author had for the writings  of Sigmund Freud, Arthur Schopenhaur and Friedrich Nietzsche as well as the  music of Richard Wagner.  There is also a nice discussion of how he  (appropriately) utilized Goethe as the paragon of genius in his &quot;Lotte  In Weimer.&quot;<br />As is well known, the &quot;centerpoint&quot; of Mann's  life was WWII and the years (actually decades) which preceded it.  Heilbut  details how Mann &amp; his family somehow escaped the wrath of Hitler (Mann  actually spread propoganda in Germany AGAINST Hitler and the Nazis) and his  safe arrival at the intellectual haven of Princeton university.  It was at  this safe distance from the war that raged in Europe that Mann was  compelled to write his masterpiece:  &quot;Dr. Faustus.&quot;  We learn  just how deeply moved he was by the destruction of his &quot;Dresden  China.&quot;  The Nazis' deal with Hitler had indeed cost Germany her very  soul.<br />  Ultimately, Mann lived a very tragic life.  The uncanny number  of suicides of people close to him, the intellectual enemies he made  (without any provocation on his part), the resentment that his  homosexuality aroused in people, his physical ailments, the exile from his  homeland and the destruction of his beloved Germany all contributed to what  was a less than enjoyable life.  However, the emotional torture and  suffering he underwent furnished him with the tools to write some of the  most powerful novels of this century.  He is perhaps the epitome of  Nietzsche's artist who &quot;transforms&quot; personal anguish into great  art.  In any case, the fervency and brilliance of his writings make him one  of the most pivotal figures of the 20th century literary landscape.  This  is his story.

I found that I did not particularly like any of them, and that dampened my appreciation of the story.<br />The book  is about a sort of competition for the lady Brett Ashley.  She enjoys using  men as her playtoys and delights in their chase after her.  The persona  from whose point of view the story is told is Jake Barnes.  The rest of the  characters are unremarkable and are mostly only memorable for their  blandness.<br />We go from France to the bullfighting performances in Spain  &amp; there are fascinating allusions to the matador / bull relationship  being akin to courtship and sexual intercourse between a man and woman.  Images of impotence and castration abound and are made all the more  significant as Jake can no longer sexually &quot;perform&quot; due to a  wartime injury.<br />This book is certainly not for everyone.  I am glad I  read it &amp; would recommend it as an important 20th century literary work  (even though I did not especially enjoy it myself).  It is not so different  from the apathetic landscape of T.S. Eliot's poem &quot;The  Wasteland&quot;;  a world in which it is thought that feeling nothing at  all is preferable to feeling pain.  But nothing could be more horrifying  than a notion such as that....	2000-07-16

There is none of the stream-of-consciousness  experiments or literary time warps &amp; wormholes that you will find in so  many other 20th century writers (such as William Faulkner and Hermann  Broch).  While he is perhaps not in the same league as Earnest Hemingway in  writing this style, he is none-theless a very talented  author.<br />&quot;Cannery Row&quot; is about a blue-collar community of  people who lead simple lives.  However, as Dr. Keating says in &quot;Dead  Poets Society,&quot;  simple does not and need not necessarily = oridinary.  I found myself falling in love with many of the characters, with their  aww-shucks mentality &amp; sleepy-eyed approach to life.<br />One thing which  differentiates this novels from most other 20th century works is that it is  actually, for the most part, an upbeat story.  It lacks the morose  undertones of the majority of novels written in the past 100-150 years.  It  is a book about the risks of trying to fulfill one's dreams...and the  heartaches and pleasures that this crazy life has to offer.  A wonderful  book.	2000-07-16

In this book, the author detail the ages of Early Greece thru to the fall of the Roman Empire.<br />  Starr details for us how Alexander of Macedon conquered the Persian Navy by  taking over the Persian ports (and thus giving the Persian fleet nowhere to  land).  He also writes of the immense importance that Piraeus held for  Athens;  it was due to the revenues of her seapower that Athens was able to  build such wonders as the Parthenon.  Starr then demonstrates why this  authority over the seas was so very important for Athens during the early  stages of the Peloponnesian war.<br />We also learn how seapower was one of  the primary ingrediants that made Rome a power to reckon with.  It was the  turning-of-the tables with Carthage as far as seapower was concerned which  was the decisive factor of the First Punic War.<br />Starr continues with the  use of seapower by Julius Caesar to both rid the Meditteranean of pirates  as well as to further his empire.<br />While one may disagree with some of the  opinions of Starr, this book is well worth reading for any maritime  scholars or historians of antiquity.	2000-07-16

This is yet another wonderful book written by the physicist / mathematician Freeman J. Dyson of Princeton university.  In this book he discusses at length his views on scientific revolutions.  He also  articulates how his thoughts both overlap and differ from other authorities  on the subject (such as Thomas Kuhn on MIT).<br />Specifically, Dyson looks  at the three things found in the title and how they influence scientific  advancements.  He elucidates the different approaches that astronomers use  vs. biologists to find what they are &quot;after.&quot; He also describes  how biologists could learn a lot from their astronomer brethren.  Dyson  points out how the Internet has provided an excellent tool for science as  it has &quot;shrunk&quot; the size of the Earth.  The ways in which it has  been able to speed up research protocals and methods have made an  incredible impact on the world of science.<br />Dyson also writes at length  about the implications of discerning the properties of the entire human  genome.  He argues that it will not, as some have said, lead to a 2-tier  society of those who can afford to genetically maniuplate their children,  and those who cannot. This is a significant subject in this day and age of  bio-technology.  For if things go awry (which Dyson assures us they won't)  we could end up with one group of people with the ability to  pave the road  for their children before they are even born;  they could genetically  arrange for them to be admitted to the best schools, get the best jobs and  make the most $$$$.  Meanwhile, the children of the &quot;have nots&quot;  would become a sort of slave race to their &quot;superiors.&quot;  They  would be restricted to only the most menial and lowest paying jobs &amp;  would be denied higher education by default.  It would be somewhat akin to  the societal situation found in the movie &quot;Gattaca.&quot;  However,  Dyson vehemently suggests that there is reason for optimism concerning this  rather horrifying concept.<br />As is usual with Dyson books, this one is a  must-read for those who have a love (or even a like) of science and the  machinery of scientific revolutions.  I would admonish everyone to read one  of the greatest scientific minds of the 20th century;  none other than  Freeman Dyson.rather horrifying concept.<br />As is usual with Dyson books, this one is a  must-read for those who have a love (or even a like) of science and the  machinery of scientific revolutions.

Michel Foucault is a rather difficult individual  to pigeonhole as belonging to one or another scholarly discipline.  Is he a philosopher?  Well, yes, but there is much more to his work than philosophical inquiry.  Is he a psychologist?  I suppose that could be argued.  Is he a historian?  Sort of, but then again his works contain so much philosophy....and round  &amp; round we go.  So, probably the best thing to do is not attempt to  confine Foucault to any one genre of scholarship.<br />The present book  showcases all of Foucault's interwoven, cross-disciplinary talents. F takes  us on a tour of the history of punishment in France &amp; Britain over the  course of the past 250 years.  Surprisingly enough, our modern day image of  huge prisons simply did not exist before that period.<br />The book grapples  with the struggle of society to remain humane in a facet of life that is  inherently inhumane:  the treatment of our criminals.  In doing so, F  adopts the methodology utilized by Nietzsche in his &quot;On The Geneology  Of Morals.&quot;<br />We begin with the most grotesque executions of a few  hundred years ago &amp; witness how the paradigm shift went from vengeance  to reform re: our handling of criminals.  F notes how the primary goal of  the prison became one of making the prisoner paranoid that he was being  watched, which would (hopefully) instill within him the understanding that  he could not get away with violating rules (both inside the prison &amp;  also once he was released back into society).<br />This is an extraordinary  book that I would recommend to anyone who is interested in the judicial  system, the history of the prison, or anyone who just has a curiousity  about the social &amp; political forces which decide the manner in which we  mete out punishment to our malefactors.  A great read.	2000-05-13

Is this book redundant, as one reviewer accused it of being?  Most  assuredly so, but that should hardly be a surprise in a text such as this  which explores the inklings of a powerful intellect that is attempting to  grapple with the &quot;big&quot; questions.<br />Augustine writes with a  brutal honesty about himself &amp; his weaknesses of which most of us, I  would wager, would be incapable of duplicating.  The book is filled with  theological speculations and a sense of deep-seated guilt that Augustine  feels because of his sins.  Some of the passages regarding faith might seem  a bit ad-hoc to the modern reader, but I suppose there is no way around  that.<br />This is a good book, but it is not a book for everyone.  I would  recommend it if you have an interest in philosophy, religion, or the  philosophy of religion.

He kills a man in self defense, but is charged with pre-meditated murder.  Camus uses this discomforting tale to  explore the framework of 20th century existentialism.<br />No doubt this is a  post-modern work.  The extraordinary degree of apathy demonstrated by the  persona is something that reminds me of the blandness of the characters in  Earnest Hemingway's &quot;The Sun Also Rises.&quot;  Nothing means anything  to him.  Not life.  Not marriage.  Not the death of his mother, and not his  own execution.<br />Reading this book, one becomes transfixed with the  horrible plight of this miserable man.  We sympathize with the absurdity of  it even as we shake our heads at his deplorable character and lack of  judgment.<br />This novel is terse, but it is powerful.  The power is not lost  in its brevity, but rather focused in it.  I would recommend that it be  read alongside the short story &quot;The Wall&quot; by John Paul Sartre.  Both are what I would call trademark works of existentialism.	2000-05-06

Yet another  name which deserves to be mentioned in this prestigious pantheon is that of  John Forbes Nash.  This book tells his story.<br />  Nash is (he is still  living) a mathematical genius who received his doctorate from Princeton and  then went on to teach at MIT.  As a human being, Nash leaves a lot to be  desired.  Unfortunately, unlike many other personages who have been endowed  with a brilliant intellect, Nash was unable to refrain from engaging in  megalomania.  He was a pedantic Nietzschian elitist who was more than a  little pompous &amp; enjoyed talking down to people whom he knew were not  his intellectual equal.  Nash treated both the main women of his life with  contempt and not surprisingy has not picked up too many close friends over  the years.<br />He also lacked a respect for the sacred art of pedagogy.  He  was recognized by both his students and peers at MIT as being a very poor  professor who did not really care about his students.  He also pulled some  rather silly pranks such as including Fermat's last thereom on his  undergraduate's final exam.<br />His less than stellar character  notwithstanding, however, what is not in dispute is his genius.  He made  several contributions to mathematics which are truly important. He solved  what was known as the &quot;embedding problem for manifolds&quot; in  geometry &amp; also wrote extensively on Game Theory (for which he won the  Nobel Prize in economics in 1994).<br />What makes Nash's story remarkable is  that he also suffered from schizophrenia.  He reportedly showed up at MIT  one day &amp; professed that aliens from outer space were sending him  encrypted messages that only he could decipher - in the New York Times.  He  also declared himself emperor of Antartica &amp; sought asylum from NATO.  During his intermittent stays in mental hospitals he became friends with  the poet Robert Lowell, who was himself a patient (suffering from  manic-depression).  Later, Nash quit his post at MIT and wandered the  campus of his beloved Princeton like a lost zombie.  He became known to the  undergraduates as the &quot;phantom of Fine Hall.&quot;<br />What caused Nash'  mental illness is unclear.  Genetics would seem to be a significant factor,  given that one of his sons (who was himself a mathematical genius in his  own right) also suffered from the disease - perhaps even more than Nash.  Other contributing factors were likely his (failed) attempt to solve the  Riemann hypothesis &amp; his infatuation with the legendary John von  Neumann.<br />This is a wonderfully well written book.  It is an extraordinary  story of an exceptional man who fell into the depths of madness &amp; later  emerged to win the Nobel Prize.<br />Nasar also offers a nice compass for  the various enviroments Nash found himself in throughout the different  stages of his life.  Nasar provides a vivid background for each scene and  siginificant person that Nash comes across.  She also bequeaths detailed  information on various institutions (such as the Institute for Advanced  Study) of which I was not aware.<br />I would recommend this book for anyone  who is interested in John Nash, the history of Princeton or the thin line  which separates genius and madness.

I can still remember hearing on the radio of his passing as I was driving along one dark December night.  I remember feeling all the air go out of my lungs  &amp; how depressed I was.<br />In the book Sagan details his fight against  cancer as well as a retrospective look back over his magnificent life.  The  book takes us almost to the very end of his life (the final chapter was  written only a few months before he lay on his deathbead).  He talks about  big numbers, big ideas, big questions and big problems faced by the human  race.<br />Two of the biggest issues he tackles in this book are global  warming / environmental issues and nuclear war.  These are hardly new  topics for Sagan - he has discussed both many times in previous books.  However, his insights on these matters are always trenchant, fresh &amp;  worth reading.<br />He discusses at great length how politics play far too  great a role in environmental protection issues &amp; how politicians  always tend to pick the one scientist out of a million who supports their  agenda while ignoring all the other scientists who unite in a chorus of  admonishments and warnings re: technology vs. environment issues.<br />He also  repeats his earlier warnings against our complacent attitude towards  nuclear weapons in the post Cold War era.  His appeals to reason are  passionate as he contemplates the thought of someone doing the unthinkable.  His points on these issues should cause all of us a moment of pause to  think them through.<br />The one thing I did not care for was Sagan's implicit  view that science and religion are mutually exclusive. This is why I did  not give the book 5 stars. There are many scientists who believe in God,  and there are many who do not.  Placing an artificial dichotomy between the  two is not only incorrect but is rather silly.  The Yale physicist Henry  Margeneau, for one, has stated that he has not observed this vast bias  towards atheism among scientists.  Now, some scientists are anti-religion,  no doubt.  But there are also multitudes out there such as the legendary  Princeton physicist Freeman Dyson who would consider themselves agnostics  but would also be pro-religion.  Now, if Sagan chooses not to believe in  God, that is his business.  However, to attempt to compel us to believe  that his views are representative of every other scientist on the planet is  unwarranted.  One would expect such an assumption from lesser minds such as  Richard Dawkins, but coming from Sagan it is disappointing.<br />At any rate,  I do not want to end on a negative note.  That Sagan did a heroic job  bringing science into the mainstream and making it &quot;fun&quot; there  can be no doubt.  I am quite sure that I am only one of millions of people  whom he inspired during his lifetime.  In fact, he was one of the first  personages who spurred in me a yearning interest in science and for that I  am in his debt.

The  advantage of this publication is that not only do you get the poem itself,  but you also receive critical essays written on the work by such personages  as Scott Elledge (who also edited the book), Voltaire, Viginia Woolfe, John  Keats, William Blake, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Alfred, Lord Tennyson,  Matthew Arnold, Christopher Ricks and Harold Bloom (just to name a few).  For the serious student of Milton, the literary criticism that has been  written is nearly as important as the poem itself.<br />&quot;Paradise  Lost&quot; is the Protestant counterpart to Dante's &quot;Divne  Comedy.&quot;  That is to say, it is the epic poem of the Protestant  tradition just as Dante's work is the great epic poem of the Catholic  heritage.  Unlike Dante, however, English speaking people do not have to  worry about anything getting lost in translation, for Milton wrote in  English.  Great works written in English were fairly sparse before the time  of Shakespeare, and this is one of the few great epic works to be written  in English since .<br />What &quot;PL&quot; deals with is the fall of Satan  &amp; the subsequent fall of man.  Milton attempts to &quot;justify the  ways of God to man&quot; as he says in his famous line.  Whether he does  this or not is a matter of opinion, but what is not in debate is that he  wrote an extraordinary piece of literature.<br />Milton uses the famous  &quot;free will&quot; defense for evil in the world and gives us a  panoramic vision of heaven, hell, the garden of Eden and the entire cosmos.  Regardless of whether people accept this position, Milton offers the best  example of the free will argument that I have ever read.<br />We also get to  meet Satan (Lucifer) and in many ways we get to know him even better than  God.  It has even been said that Satan is actually the &quot;hero&quot; of  the tale  even though Satan ultimately loses (sort of like Ahab in  Melville's &quot;Moby Dick&quot;).  While this point has come under much  scrutiny,what I can say is that Satan is a magnificent fellow.  His  speeches are generally the most dramatic &amp; powerful and he has the most  memorable lines (such as the infamous &quot;It is better to rule in hell  than serve in heaven&quot;).<br />So, for anyone remotely interested in  literature, religion or philosophy, I would HIGHLY recommend this poem.  You may just find there some ideas which you have never thought of before.  An outstanding epic poem which ranks up there with the works of Dante,  Virgil, Homer, Shelley and Goethe.It has even been said that Satan is actually the &quot;hero&quot; of  the tale  even though Satan ultimately loses (sort of like Ahab in  Melville's &quot;Moby Dick&quot;).

And this is, in fact, an extraordinary  work on cosmology.<br />As a pre-requisite to Ferris' book, I would recommend  &quot;The First Three Minutes&quot; by Stephen Weinberg.  Although  Weinberg's book is 20 years old (published, 1979), it is nonetheless still  a classic in the cosmology field.  It is also rather terse - only 150 or so  pages in &amp; out.<br />Ferris brings us up to to date on many of the  &quot;happenings&quot; in cosmology since 1979.  He discusses such diverse  areas of physics as gravity waves, the mystery of singularities, why black  holes have no hair and quantum weirdness (although the latter is an  understatement...).  I actually preferred this book over the much more  famous &quot;A Brief History In Time&quot; by the Cambridge physicist  Stephen Hawking.  Hawking's prose is a bit more dry than Ferris' and  &quot;Brief / Time&quot; does not go as in depth into many important  concepts as this book.<br />So, for those of you who wonder (like me) how in  the world the universe began (or, perhaps, how in the universe the world  began), this book is for you.  Ferris can't answer all your questions, to  be sure.  But you can learn an awful lot in the process of engaging what we  don't know.  Also, in addition to this book I would recommend the PBS home  video &quot;The Creation Of The Universe&quot; which is hosted by Ferris.  It is the best video cosmological documentary I have ever seen (and I have  seen quite a few).  It, too, is available at Amazon.com	2000-03-21

What surfaces from these extreme and morose circumstances is a true masterpiece of philosophy.<br />The book is told in the same general style as a Platonic  dialogue, with two interlocutors;  Boetheius and the personification of  Philosophy.  Boethius chooses a Lady figure to represent the avatar of  Philosophy.  Its construction reminds me very much of Diotema's parlance  with Socrates in Plato's &quot;Symposium.&quot;<br />In the book, Boethius  does a Christianizing interpretation of many classical myths and  allegories.  My favorite was the spin he put on the myth of Orpheus in the  underworld.<br />This is a fine book in the history of philosophy and  religion;  a must read for medieval scholars.	2000-03-19

Kaufmann deserves a great deal of credit for bringing Nietzsche  out of the ranks of taboo books for the (unfortunate) association with  Hitler after World War II.<br />This association is ironic when one  considers how Nietzsche extols the Jewish race on pages 187 &amp; 188,  describing them as<br />...beyond any doubt the strongest, toughest, and  purest race now living in Europe;  they know how to prevail even under the  worst conditions...by means of virtues that today one would like to mark as  vices - thanks above all to a resolute faith that need not be ashamed  before &quot;modern ideas&quot;....<br />Can anyone seriously contend that  Hitler was inspired to commit genocide upon the Jewish people because of  Nietzsche with passages such as this in mind?<br />If I have one bone to pick  with this book, it is Nietzsche's unwarranted misogynistic tirades in the  chapter called &quot;Our Virtues.&quot;  These attacks on woman's  intellectual acumen are not only wrong, but completely unnecessary and  contribute nothing to Nietzsche's overall philosophical thread of thought.  His dictum of the &quot;eternally boring in woman&quot; (a verbal joust to  Goethe's &quot;eternal feminine&quot;) is nothing more than an adolescent,  shallow cheap shot.  Personally, I think his hatred of women has much more  to due with his psychology (the fact that he was such a very lonely man +  the inaccessiblity of Cosima Wagner) than any serious intellectual analysis  that he devoted to the issue.  In any case, given the accomplishments of  women in the 20th century (as well as the &quot;hidden&quot; triumphs of  historical women from before this century) any educated person today would  be compelled to dismiss the idea of men being mentally superior to women as  hogwash.<br />With the exception of the anti-woman chapter, the rest of this  book is quite good.  It is in many ways a re-writing of his &quot;Also  Sprach Zarathustra&quot; via a non-poetic medium.  Most of Nietzsche's more  important ideas are incorporated into the book at some point or other.  Also, Kaufmann furnishes the reader with helpful footnotes which elucidate  the allusions that Nietzsche is making.  A profound book.  To give you a  taste of why this book is worth reading, I will leave you with one of my  very favorite passages of Nietzsche.  It appears on page 153:<br />  &quot;Measure&quot; is alien to us;  let us own it;  our thrill is the  thrill of the infinite, the unmeasured.

After reading this book and some of Plato's better dialogues, it  is not difficult to understand why.  Both write with a passion &amp;  provide a remarkable contrast to the incredibly dry (and many times  verbose) prose of such philosophers as Aristotle, Hegel, Heidegger and  Kant.  If nothing else, Plato and Nietzsche are EXCITING to read.  It is  this which furnishes them with their popularity - even more than the fact  that they are two of the greatest intellectuals who ever lived.<br />Like all  &quot;portable&quot; books in the Viking series, this one contains excerpts  from works.  This is not all bad, but it is not all good, either.  I have  always felt that it is much better to read works in their entirety rather  than edited snippets.  With this in mind, the book's #1 virtue is the fact  that it contains an excellent complete &amp; unabridged translation of  &quot;Also Sprach Zarathustra.&quot;<br />In his book &quot;Beyond Good And  Evil&quot; Nietzsche stated that &quot;Books for all the world are always  foul-smelling books:  the smell of small people clings to them.&quot;  (p.  43, Walter Kaufmann, translator).  Well, if this be the case, then  &quot;Zarathustra&quot; is most decidedly NOT a book for all the world.  It  is not written for (nor, indeed is even read by very often) individuals  with small minds.  It is an epic poem that was mostly written while this  German fellow was stoned on opium.  That fact not-withstanding, it is an  astounding achievement.  (It seems that Nietzsche produced some of his best  art while he was influenced by opium - just like Edgar Allen Poe and Hector  Berlioz).<br />&quot;Zarathustra&quot; is a work that is of interest to both  philosophy &amp; literary types. It would be entirely justified for this  work to be read in a German or World literature class as opposed to being  confined to just university level philosophy courses.  Due to his  trenchant insights on art as well as his awe inspiring ideas and wonderful  command of language, it is  little mystery that Nietzsche exercised such a  profound influence over such artists as Thomas Mann, William Butler Yeats,  Franz Kafka, George Bernard Shaw, Maria Ranier Rilke and Eugene O'Neill  (among others).<br />Again much like Plato's Republic,  &quot;Zarathustra&quot; is a work which must be read at least a half dozen  times before one can really say he or she has read it once. The imagery and  metaphors are dense &amp; it is beautifully written - even in translation  (Kaufmann deserves much credit for this).  The elegance of Nietzsche and  the grandiose and fervent style of his thoughts has made him an attractive  figure to engage - even by those who disagree with most of or everything he  has to say.  But perhaps there is one single thing that I like about Mr.  Nietzsche more than anything else;  indeed, this is why I keep on coming  back to him again &amp; again.  It is the fact that he does not expect or  even want you to agree with what he says.  Rather, he wants you to re-think  what you believe &amp; challenge the premises that your beliefs stand upon.

The Greeks were simply far more artistically and scientifically  inclined than were the Romans. Moreover, the educated among the Romans  realized this;  it is for that reason that the wealthy Roman citizens hired  Greeks to be tutors to both themselves &amp; their children.<br />It is surely  not by chance that it was Octavion who commissioned Virgil to write his  epic poem.  I am compelled to believe that it was Augustus himself whom  Virgil was thinking of when he was writing these lines - and not merely  because the trek to the underworld was to foretell the future (including  the reign of Augustus).  Rather, it is because of the immense respect that  Octavion had for the Greeks - that, I think, was the impetus which inspired  these lines.<br />In this book, G.W. Bowersock does a superb job of expounding  on this fact.  We learn of how Caesar Augustus longed for a cultural fusion  between the Greeks and the Romans, much like what Alexander of Macedon was  searching for between the Macedonians and the Persians a few centuries  earlier.  Octavion wished to have the Romans learn the Greek language &amp;  dress in Greek clothing and he desired to have the Greeks learn latin and  dress in Roman attire.  The goal was to have both cultures be  interchangeable with each other while still preserving their own cultural  heritage and identity.  To have the best of both worlds shared amongst the  two peoples was the objective.  This is a noble purpose in any day &amp;  time.<br />Augustus responded to various Greek anti-Rome revolts  with a  temperance and restraint which is remarkable and in those times almost  unheard of.  He loved classical Greek plays and admonished his fellow  Romans to disinter the didactic qualities the works of art held for the  Roman people.<br />G.W.

Arrians' account of the exploits of the Macedonian is widely considered the most  accurate biography of Alexander from antiquity.  Although some of the  casualty counts are suspiciously low (especially at Issus), what is not in  debate is that this great man repeatedly won decisive battles in which his  army was far and away outmanned.<br />This is an important book about a very  influential man in human history.  Alexander was remarkable in the mercy he  showed his vanquished foes.  He gave his arch enemy, the Persian king  Darius, an honorable military funeral.  His wardrobe consisted of Persian  dress &amp; he longed for a cultural fusion between the Macedonians and  Persians. He rejected the ideas of his mentor, Aristotle, that the Greeks  were inherently superior in every way to all other cultures on Earth.

The term &quot;black hole&quot; was coined by the Princeton physicist John Archibald Wheeler.  What, exactly, a black hole is (if there even is such a thing) has been a source of debate and confusion for decades.  Clifford  Pickover inserts you as the main character of this book.  You are on a  spaceship (complete with aliens) way the heck in the future &amp; your ship  is near a black hole.  So, you &amp; your friends decide to do a close  (literally) study of the cosmic anomaly.<br />The story is entertaining &amp;  has many didactic features.  Pickover also inserts some humor so as to make  the book enjoyable as opposed to a dense treatise of rather complex  mathematical concepts.  Also, at the end of each chapter is a section  called &quot;The science behind the science fiction.&quot;  It is a  detailed account of what we presently know (or think we know) about the  notions which were presented in the narrative.<br />And, the concepts are  many.  We learn of various weird things that happen in &amp; near a black  hole, such as time slowing, the &quot;shrinking&quot; of one's perspective  due to the singularity &amp; the mind-numbing gravitational power which is  projected by black holes.....a gravity field so immense that the escape  velocity exceeds light speed.  We learn how black holes were predicted by  Einstein's theory of Relativity as well as how the many principles of  quantum mechanics come into the picture when one is attempting to  understand the nature of singularities.<br />Much of this book is speculation,  but it is educated speculation.  The conjectures on what happens inside of  a singularity, as well as the possiblity of wormholes which lead to other  universes &amp; dimensions is exciting &amp; based on our best available  current knowledge of the cosmos.  As an added bonus, there is a chapter in  the back of the book in which many of the world's leading cosmologists  answer questions posed by the author on various topics about &amp; related  to black holes.  There are also computer animation pictures of some of the  more dazzling geometrical effects that are generated by black holes.  For  anyone who is planning to visit a black hole anytime soon, this book is a  must.to black holes.

I have always thought of physics as the most marvelous branch of science.  It is the field which has granted us Laplace's demon, Pauli's exclusion, Heisenberg's uncertainty, Schroedinger's cat, Wigner's friend, the  Copenhagen interpretation and Everett's quantum universes (among other  conceptions).  At the center of it all, where the boundaries of physics and  philosophy overlap, we find the great Werner Heisenberg directing traffic.  In many ways, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle (1926) was the snowball  that got the discipline of quantum mechanics rolling.  Years later,  Richard P. Feynman was quoted as saying that every new discovery in  theoretical physics since H's uncertainty principle was merely a re-stating  of the uncertainty principle.<br />This book deals with many of the  philosophical problems associated with QM such as how observation effects  &quot;reality&quot; (if there is such a thing) and the disturbing wave /  particle duality which is exhibited by matter.  In short, QM has changed  almost everything insofar as how we interpret the &quot;actual&quot; world.  We are forced to revise what used to be common sense notions such as a  reality that is independent of an observer.  And, as H writes on page 18,  there is no turning back: &quot;The hope that new experiments will yet lead  us back to objective events in time and space, or to absolute time, are  about as well founded as the hope of discovering the end of the world  somewhere in the unexplored regions of the Antartic.&quot;<br />And so, the  best we can do is to try to cope with the myriad unsettling (if not absurd)  implications of quantum mechanics.  Heisenberg entertains many and varied  thoughts on this subject &amp; delivers them in a lucid fashion.<br />The book  also discusses some of the concepts of classical physics, some of which  still hold &amp; some which do not.  H goes into detail regarding the  theories of light &amp; colour which were devised by such great minds of  the past as Newton and Goethe.<br />The last chapter in the book deals with  the hope that science can be used as a medium by which diverse cultures may  learn to understand each other.  After all, even though the political  paradigms and ideas of nation A differ from those of nation B, 1+1 still =  2 in both places.  Scientific truths can transcend national prejudices and  suspicions.  That, among other things, is one of its endearing traits.<br />I  would highly recommend this book for any and all people who are interested  in science, philosophy or the philosophy of science.  It is an exquisite  book of science written by one of science's greatest champions.past as Newton and Goethe.<br />The last chapter in the book deals with  the hope that science can be used as a medium by which diverse cultures may  learn to understand each other.

As a book which provided the structural framework for the movie &quot;Apocalypse Now,&quot; Conrad's novel is surprisingly lacking in violence.  What it is, however, is an abosorbing story that deals with the  infamous existentialist idea of &quot;authenticity&quot; in one's approach  to life.<br />The book has sundry mesmerizing lines which describe how the  main character feels as though he is being swallowed up by the savage  jungle while on his mission to find Kurtz.  It also fulfills one of the  most remarkable journey to the underworld motifs of any hero's adventure  that I have ever read.  Those who subscribe to Jungian literary criticism  as well as the ideas of Joseph Campbell (one of Jung's disciples) will come  to crave this novel (as I did).  Speaking of Campbell, the  &quot;threshold&quot; of the trek is also quite memorable as well.<br />I  would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a novel that  captures the pulse of the major themes that were being expounded in early  20th century literature.	2000-03-15

What emerged from that horrifying experience is one of the preeminent literary works of  the 20th century.<br />  The book is about Virgil's infamous deathbed  request that his magnum opus, The &quot;Aeneid,&quot; be burned because it  was imperfect.  Most of the book is told in a dazzling but recondite  stream-of-consciousness mode, but the best section is Virgil's deathbed  discussion with Caesar Augustus.<br />Broch invokes 20th century ideals such  as the &quot;authenticity&quot; of art as a mirror to the natural world.  We also encounter the dilemma of works of art that are incomplete &amp; not  polished completely.  Aristotle said that in a perfect art work, every word  contributes to the organic whole.  Arbitrarily remove or add one word, says  Aristotle, and the whole work comes crumbling down.  Virgil uses this motif  as his justification for wishing his beloved poem burned.  Juxtaposed with  this paradigm are the pleadings of Augustus that it is Virgil's duty as a  Roman citizen to let his poem be read by all the world.  After all, the  literary excursion was to be Rome's national epic.  The scene is,  unmistakably, magnificent.<br />A considerable amount of background reading is  required before attempting to take on this work.  At a bare minimum, read  the entire canon of Virgil, especially the &quot;Aeneid.&quot;  A workable  familiarity of Roman history up until and including Augustus is necessary  and a biography of Virgil (I would recommend Peter Levi's) would also be  helpful.  I am a fairly well-read guy, but some of the allusions went over  my head.<br />The stream-of-consciousness style is interesting, but can make  the book rather dense.  Many of the sentences go on for pages and pages.  The book attempts to capture the free-thought attributes of the machinery  of Virgil's mind.  An engrossing work of prose.prose.	2000-03-12

If you like straightforward books with straightforward plots, straightforward  characters and straightforward beginnings, storylines and conclusions, this book may not for you.<br />The novel takes place in the  present, in the past, in the afterlife &amp; in the surreal world of  Kundera's imagination.  The work has several different seemingly separate  stories that Kundera somehow weaves into a coherent whole.  We meet people  that we are led to believe actually exist who talk with the author during  &quot;intermissions&quot; of the novel.  Later, we learn that Kundera was  discussing topics with the characters in his novel.<br />The book has sundry  marvelous sections which brood over just about every intellectual topic  associated with immortality.  We see an eloborate (although fictionalized)  glimpse of Goethe's historical meeting with Napoleon.  We get an impression  of how many great artists look upon their craft as mementos of their  immortality.  We even get an answer to the $60,000 question:  WHAT would  happen if Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Earnest Hemingway met up in the  afterlife?  (Wow!  What a thought!)<br />As I mentioned earlier, this book  does not have the standard structure of most other novels.  That said,  however, it was quite enjoyable to read.  It did not go off the deep end of  Faulkneresque stream-of-consciousness psycho-babble.  An excellent and  entertaining postmodern effort.	2000-03-05

In a perfect world, I would have given this book 3 &amp; a half stars,  However, Amazon only allows full star increments.  The novel was better than 3 stars, but not quite 4 stars.<br />This is a story about a horrifying  plague that takes place at a large city in Northern Africa.  It does  deliver on all of the advertised scenes of human anguish in their  defenseless struggle against an enemy they cannot see.  One can easily  identify with the main character of the book, an overworked doctor who does  his best to grapple with a microscopic foe that is intent on defeating his  every effort to suppress the plague.<br />As expected with Camus, it is also  an existentialist novel.  It explores how the &quot;problem&quot; of  natural evil is apparently no longer answered satisfactorily by the  Judeo-Christian tradition.  It also toys with the thought of a possibility  for sainthood for those who wish to be magnanimous in this life, but do not  believe in God.<br />The one serious issue I have with this book is with the  ethics of the doctor.  Throughout the book, there is a journalist from  France who believes that it is &quot;unfair&quot; for him to be quarantined  with the rest of the locals when he was, after all, just passing thru.  This is a very human and understandable plight.  However, the fellow not  only devises plans of escaping from the city (and thus breaking quarantine)  but even divulges these plans to the doctor.  Instead of having him  incarcerated for his intentions, the doctor actually encourages him to  escape.  That would be such a blatantly irresponsible course of action for  a doctor to take that it goes well beyond the normal &quot;suspension of  disbelief&quot; that we should have when engaging literature.  The whole  point of a quarantine is to isolate a disease so that it does not spread to  other cities and countries.  For a physician to go along with the aim of a  person to break the isolation is nothing short of despicable.<br />Other than  that criticism, however, the book is everything it's cracked up to be.

I think that nearly all of us have had at least some familiarity with being in love with the one person we cannot have.  &quot;The Sorrows of Young  Werther&quot; is written by and based on a biographical event of one of the  greatest minds of all time.  Not even genius is immune to this painful  ordeal.<br />The book is about adolescence; the stage in life where we feel it  would be better to be dead than to be without that one (and only) person  whom we think will make our life complete.  It is the story of an  overly-passionate young man's life that is cut short by his own ardor for  love.<br />It cannot be overstated what an effect this book had on the  populace of Europe in the late 18th century.  There was an epidemic rate of  young people who would dress up like Werther and kill themselves with the  book itself in their pockets.  Again, it is because the content of this  story is so intimate to all of us that it ignites such a fire of pathos in  us.<br />For all who choose to read this tragic book, I would recommend Thomas  Mann's &quot;Lotte In Weimer&quot; as it is a wonderful &quot;sequel&quot;  (sort of) to &quot;Werther.&quot;  If ever you have the opportunity to read  anything by Goethe, my advice is to not waste it.

Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov has an absolutely marvelous sense of humor that is unbecoming a professor of literature at Harvard.  Good for him!  The humor of this book is unmistakable &amp; is transparent to even the most naive of Nabokov's readers.  That this gentleman can write a book that  is hilarious and at the same time a work of depth and genius is awe  inspiring.<br /> &quot;Pale Fire&quot; is the tale of a pedantic, psychotic,  misogynistic literary critic who attempts to write an overly-elaborate  critique of a poem written by a recently deceased scholar.  What is so  amusing is how this academician commits so many undergraduate fallacies  such as reading too much into a poem and saying &quot;the poet must have  had me in mind when he wrote this.&quot;  He catches erudite allusions only  to miss the most obvious references.  In the meantime, he also grapples  with the demons of his hypochondriac unconscious which make him think that  someone or something is &quot;after&quot; him.<br />This is a wonderful book  that has very few peers.  For those other reviewers who found that it  lacked depth, I would suggest that they read it again.  If they still don't  find profundity, I would recommend that they read it a third time....a  fourth time, etc. until they see what is really &quot;going on&quot; and  that the book may be all fun and games, but is fun and games centered  around a recondite maze of allegories.

I truly believe that this book IS for everyone.  Unlike so much other 20th century literature, one need not be well read to get something out of it.   <br />    The story is of  two of man's most cherished and hated traditions:  Love and War.   The  tragedy is that we have had so much of the latter and so little of the  former.   We see much of both in &quot;For Whom The Bell Tolls.&quot;  It  is a tender story of two young people who just want to live a  &quot;normal&quot; life together during the Spainish civil war, but who are  prevented from doing thus due to their being in the wrong place at the  wrong time.<br />It is incredulous to me that there were other reviewers who  found this book &quot;boring.&quot;  I can only surmise that anyone who  would find a novel such as this boring will not find anything  &quot;exciting&quot; unless it has Arnold Scharzenegger swinging around a  machine gun.  But that, I believe, is the fault of the reader's lack of  attention span and cannot be blamed on Hemingway.<br />The author writes that  &quot;The world is a fine place and worth the fighting for and I hate very  much to leave it.&quot;  I would agree.  Anyone else who agrees, and anyone  who has a passion and zest for life should read this book.  One of the best  examples of American literature in the 20th century.	2000-03-04

There are many magnificent  personas which Mann brings to life under his pen.  They range from  eccentric doctors to off-the-wall acadamecians to one really hilarious  character who can seemingly do nothing and still make me laugh.<br />  In an  essay Mann wrote, he described the book as something akin to a grail quest  for Castorp.  That, I think, is the closest one can come to saying what  this book is &quot;about.&quot;  I often debate with myself whether the  conclusion is deus ex machina, but will probably have to read it a few more  times before I decide for sure.

Otherwise, this book will make no sense  whatsoever.<br />  Mann writes a hilarious tale of &quot;what if?&quot; the  real life Charlotte Kestner &amp; Goethe met up in Weimer 50 or so years  after the publication of Werther.  The result is a true masterpiece of  writing.  We get to meet Charlotte, as well as Arthur Schopenhaur's rather  ditzy (at least in this novel, anyway) sister, Adele along with  the  almighty Goethe himself.  The book centers around an interesting question:  which is more real?  The true life Charlotte?  Or the fictional one of  Werther?  This is an intriguing question, as Mann furnishes the  &quot;real&quot; Kestner (which is also a fictional one) with a  &quot;real&quot; personality;  something which was rather lacking in  Goethe's story.<br />  The book has everything one would want for fans of  both Goethe and Mann.  It articulates the &quot;pressures&quot; put on  people who exist in reality who provide the inspiration for fictional  characters in novels.  Who, in fact, has it worse?  The innocent individual  who is inserted into fictional stories?  Or the artist who feeds personal  experiences into the machinery of his genius with the efficacy of producing  great art?  Who makes the greater sacrifice in the name of creativity?<br />  This is a truly wonderful book.  Although most of Mann's books have a  distinctive humor to them, this one is much more lighthearted than any of  his others.  There is even a wonderful chapter in which we first meet  Goethe....a stream-of-consciousness  which asks the $60,000 question:  what  HAPPENS inside a mind as massive as Goethe's?  It kind of reminded me of  Hermann Broch's &quot;The Death Of Virgil&quot; which asked a similar  question regarding the mental acumen of Virgil in a stream-of-consciousness  way.

Sadly, the family heritage begins to sink into a quagmire of bad business decisions, bad marital decisions, apathy and just  plain bad luck.<br />  What really sets this opus (and other Mann novels)  apart from &quot;standard fare&quot; works of literature is the depth and  richness of personalities which are found in its characters.  There are no  &quot;stock characters&quot; to be found in Mann.  By the end of the novel,  I felt as though I personally knew the Buddenbrooks and as such was  compelled to feel sad about their fate.  I can think of no higher  compliment that I could possibly grant a novel.<br />  The story tells of a  family which thought it would continue to prosper forever.  The stark  reality soon sets in that the family will have to struggle in order to  retain any sort of Buddenbrook dignity at all.

However, it is a book which will convert few atheists.  Almost all the reasoning in it is ad-hoc.  Jeffrey should do better research before writing books in the  future.<br />  There is a brief critique of evolution in which Jeffrey  says that evolution  contradicts the second law of thermodynamics.  That is  fundamentalist falsity, and has been known as such for close to a century.  Due to the earth being an open system (it receives energy from the sun)  the &quot;closed system&quot; argument of the second law of thermodynamics  (entropy always increases) does not apply.  There is also a population  argument (i.e.:  if evolution were true, there would be a heck of a lot  more people here) is a very contrived (and bad) argument.  Jeffery does not  have a science degree.  He would do well to read books by Darwinists &amp;  then attempt to critique them rather than utilizing arguments developed by  people at the ICR which have been obsolete for decades.<br />  The bible  codes as well as the contentions of the number &quot;7&quot; appearing in  the bible are also very, very, very ad-hoc.  I am sure you could find codes  in virtually any book if you jury rigged the &quot;experiment&quot; thus.  This ongoing thesis of secret codes is nothing but an embarrassment to  intellectual believers.<br />  Jeffrey also makes some rather unwarranted  claims about &quot;medical knowledge in the bible.&quot;  Yes, the bible  does contain good advice which would prevent people from becoming ill due  to poor personal hygeine.  However, this does not IN ITSELF mean that it is  therefore the word of God.  It is kind of like saying that, when Einstein  wrote his equations for the theory of relativity (a bit more recondite  subject than personal hygeine), THEREFORE, it MUST have come from God, for  man is not smart enough to figure out the theory of relativity on his own.  But then, at this point, you must wonder:  what CAN man do on his own?  (If  anything)?  And where do you draw the line between what is from man &amp;  what was divine inspiration?  And, if you take the other route, you must  concede that man IS smart enough to figure out relativity, but IS NOT smart  enough to figure out how to bathe himself &amp; maintain proper treatment  of sewage.  But AT THAT POINT you must ask:  how did all of these other  cultures (i.e.: non-Christian) learn to bathe themselves if they did not  know of Yahweh?  Did God inspire them, too?  If so, what is so mystical  about the topic of personal hygeine that we can't figure it out for  ourselves?

This is one of the great books on human nature of all time.  The book centers on the question of ethical caste systems in human affairs.  Is it (as Nieztsche and Machivelli would have it) the case that humans find  themselves operating under different ethical laws which depend on such  things as birthright, intelligence and social status?  Or is the situation  that (as Kant and Cicero would have it) all men are equal before the law?  And what, exactly, is it which decides this?<br />  The story centers around  a poor Russian peasant named Raskolnikov who believes himself to be the  calibre of person that Alexander of Macedon and Napoleon were &amp;  therefore is exempt from the &quot;normal&quot; everyday ethics of the rest  of us.  He contrives to murder a wealthy  old woman and then use her money  for noble purposes.  The plan turns into a debacle, however, when a second  person shows up &amp; he is forced to kill her, too.<br />  From there,  Raskolnikov's mental deterioration begins.

It was rewarding, though.  Price wrote the book explicitly for philosophers and physicists.  Frankly, it was nice to see a book written thus with all the condescending  attitudes that these two (?) spheres of knowledge have had towards each  other in this day and age.  This book belongs in the same prestigious realm  as the books on physics &amp; philosophy that were written by Werner  Heisenberg and Sir James Jeans earlier this century.  I would like to see  more books of this type in the future.<br />  As you might have guessed,  the book deals with the nature of time.  It is HIGHLY recommended that  anyone attempting grapple with this intellectual Godzilla have a general  understanding of quantum mechanics (if, that is, anyone really DOES  understand QM) and some background in thermodynamics and relativity would  not hurt, either.  This book is not for those who think of books by  Danielle Steele as intellectually stimulating.<br />  The book deals with the  entropy &quot;problem&quot; of how it is that matter ever got to its low  entropy state after the big bang, since (apparently) high entropy (heat  death) is its natural state.  Price tours some potential (although  sometimes far fetched) answers to this query.<br />  For me, the most  fascinating facet of the book was its discussion of the idea of advanced  action as a solution to the nonlocality &quot;problem&quot; in QM.  It's  amazing for me to think that two entangled photons could already KNOW that  the other's spin is going to change at such-and-such a time due to their  travelling at the speed of light.  Although Price did not invent this  concept, he supports it (compellingly) and also objects to the normal  criticism that either we can have relativity or free will, but not both.  A  truly fascinating concept for physicists and philosophers alike.<br />  So,  if you want a wild and engrossing intellectual ride, this book is for you.	2000-03-01

However, what he was good at was being a sort of philosophical  &quot;critic.&quot;  Kaufmann was a very erudite man who wrote lots of  great stuff on the arts, history, literature and philosophy as well as the  relationship that the three share with each other.<br />  The present book  details the infamous existential motif of art replacing religion as the  representative of what is most sacred in the human spirit.  Kaufmann writes  about the joys and knowledge that are offered by great tragedies and the  dark poetry of writers such as Rilke.<br />  Kaufmann also does a credible  job of critiquing several philosophers, historians and literary figures.  Among the people he discusses are Goethe, Shakespeare, Nietzsche, Rilke and  Hegel.  Particularly interesting is his napalming of Heidegger.  I have  always thought Heidegger was over-rated &amp; Kaufmann's comical (although  valid) tirades were quite refreshing.<br />  Kaufmann ends with a compelling  critique of the historian Arnold Toynbee, insisting that Toynbee's attempt  to be both poet and historian calls into question the veracity of his  exegesis of the facts of history.<br />  This is  a great book for anyone  who is interested in philosophy  &amp; the arts since the time of  Shakespeare. This book is especially for people interested in 20th century  philosophy &amp; those who ponder its future trajectory.	2000-03-01

Well, perhaps.....but....I  must forewarn people the Martin is no where near the calibre of writer of  Lewis.  In fact, none of these short stories actually have a  &quot;plot&quot;, per se.  While Lewis' books are imaginative stories,  Martin's book has characters chatting about various philosophical issues  &amp; the atheist interlocutor always wins (surprise, surprise!).  While  the stories do a decent job of getting his point across, they are not much  for suspense or drama.<br />  But, it is probably unfair to compare Martin  with Lewis.  The book is basically a re-telling of the major points of his  magnum opus (&quot;Atheism:  A Philosophical Justification&quot;) in a more  &quot;entertaining&quot; way.  As far as that goes, Martin does a pretty  credible job.<br />  The book is filled with (mostly ad-homineum) attacks  against theism.  One of the more notable cases is on page 229 where Martin  infers that theists are unsophisticated, unintelligent individuals who lack  education.  That is not true, any more than it would be true to say that  atheists have these unattractive qualities.  In fact, the trend now is that  religion is making a comeback - even in (whoa!) the ivory towers of  academia.  There are a growing number of people with impeccable academic  credentials who are writing critiques of Darwinism as well as philosphical  &quot;justifications&quot; for theism.  Now, could these people be wrong?  Of course.  But that's not the point.  If they are wrong, it is not due to  the fact that they lack any adequate &quot;training.&quot;  Trying to write  off one's adversary as just a bunch of backwoods, country bumpkin rednecks  does not hold water.  A logician the stature of Martin should know  better.<br />  The book also contains what I found a rather horrifying  chapter called &quot;The Free Will Improvement Project.&quot;  In it,  characters have the idea of using artificial surgical implants to  &quot;keep tabs&quot; on what people are thinking &amp; thereby prevent  crimes &amp; pernicious activities from happening.  I am surprised that  none of the other reviewers found this thought rather terrifying;  to me it  sounds like a cross between George Orwell's &quot;1984&quot; and the movie  &quot;One Flew Over A Cuckoo's Nest.&quot;  As Nietzsche once said,  &quot;Better to will the void than void the will.&quot;  I would agree.<br />  Overall, this was a good effort &amp; is worth reading by people on both  sides of the fence.better.<br />    The book also contains what I found a rather horrifying  chapter called &quot;The Free Will Improvement Project.&quot;  In it,  characters have the idea of using artificial surgical implants to  &quot;keep tabs&quot; on what people are thinking &amp; thereby prevent  crimes &amp; pernicious activities from happening.

This is a wonderful book for anyone who is interested in astronomy.  It tells the story of seven astronomers who would come to be known as the 7 Samurai for their work in researching the topography of the cosmos.  Come  to find out, the 7 scientists discovered that the Milky Way (as well as the  entire Virgo Supercluster) is being pulled towards a huge black  &quot;wall&quot; in space that is over 450 million light years across. That  phenomena has come to be known as the Great Attractor.  Amazingly, the  galaxies (and we, too) are moving towards it at an astonishingly 750 miles  per second!<br />  The book is filled with great facts about astronomy &amp;  its history (particularly the groundbreaking discoveries of the 20th  century such as the Hubble Redshift).  I learned a lot about how astronomy  &quot;works&quot; and how the people involved in the field come to  understand the data that is rendered them by their equipment.<br />  One of  the things that Dressler did very well was incorporate  the &quot;human  element&quot; to the celestial quest for knowledge.  He described very  nicely the personalities and quirks of the other 6 astronomers &amp; also  did a great job of being honest about what happened when things went wrong  (often blaming himself for quarrels which broke out).  I felt as though I  knew all 7 of them personally by the end of the book.  This is a nice  feature in a science book as in this day &amp; age so many books of the  genre come across as cold and indifferent.<br />  This is a great book.  Buy  it, read it and you just might feel compelled to invest in a telescope!  (I did!)	2000-02-29

Although I found some of the criticisms of Darwinism a wee bit ad-hoc, the book as a whole has some powerful arguments from the likes of  some of the more noteworthy theists such as  JP Moreland, Michael Dembski  and Hugh Ross.  Ross' essay was probably the best in the book as it dealt  with clear, un-ambiguous evidence for a supreme mind.  There is also an  interesting article on the specificity of language being a sound analogy to  the specificity &amp; complexity of DNA.<br />  Now, many of the reviewers  who gave it one star do not appear to have even read it.  Two of them  bragged as much.  Regardless of the subject matter of a book, I often find  it difficult to review a work w/out reading it.  I can only cast my  suspicion on other people's ability to do so.<br />  One of the most  frequent criticisms of &quot;Creationism&quot; (for lack of a better term)  is that it is unfalsifiable &amp; therefore bad science.  I concede the  point that it is unfalsifiable, but I would caution an atheist against  calling it bad science.<br />  Most physicists believe they have it all  figured out up to 10^-43 power of one second after the Big Bang (known as  the Planck Epoch). Beyond this instant (an incredibly small instant) the  universe existed in the state of a singularity of infinite density and  infinite temperature.  The laws of physics as we know and love them came  into being at 10^-43 of one second.  Therefore, if the atheist is not to  insert an arbitrary double-standard, ALL speculations and theories of  &quot;what happened before&quot; MUST be labeled as bad science. I know of  few atheists who are willing to demote Sagan's oscillating universe theory  or the universe as a quantum-fluctuation-gone-awry paradigm as bad science.  However, the atheist cannot have it both ways.<br />  Also, due to the  enormous &quot;specificity&quot; in the laws of physics which were  necessary for life (also known as the Anthropic Principle) the rival claim  of the atheist to an intelligent designer is the multiple universe theorem.  The idea is that since the odds are so incredible that a universe such as  ours' could have emerged from a singularity &quot;just so&quot; (according  to the British physicist Roger Penrose the odds are of the magnitude of  10^10^123), there must be many (perhaps an infinite number) of alternate  universes.  Why?  To justify this one.  Otherwise, it is mathematically  unacceptable to believe that this could be the only universe and yet it  turned out &quot;just so.&quot;<br />  Now, I have no problem with  atheists formulating hypotheses such as this.  However, when they do so  they are commiting the same &quot;crime&quot; that they are accusing the  Creationists of.  Again, you can't have it both ways.<br />  Ultimately,  whatever one tries to &quot;place&quot; before the Planck epoch and  &quot;outside&quot; this universe is going to be a bad Hypothesis.  Period.  No matter if it comes from the calibre of a scientist such as Feynman,  Dyson or Hawking, it is STILL incapable of being proven or disproven.  So,  all we can do is take the data that is inside THIS universe &amp; make our  inference from there.  This book is a good tool for those on both sides of  the debate to do just that.  If you are close minded (as most of the 1 star  reviewers are), there is no need to bother reading any books in the realm  of cosmology.<br />For futher reading on the Anthropic Principle I would  recommend &quot;Universes&quot; by the philospoher of science John Leslie.

This book does not and cannot provide an  in-depth view of each emperor's life and times &amp; politics. Indeed,  great individuals such as Augustus, Claudius, Hadrian &amp; Marcus Aurelius  warrant entire volumes dedicated to them separately.  However, Grant does a  wonderful job of giving his readers a &quot;taste&quot; of each ruler's  reign as well as some useful (and sometimes colorful) anecdotes about their  lives.<br />  This is a tremendous book for those who would like a nice  quick-and-easy history of the Romans who wore the purple.  For those who  would like more in-depth books that cover certain epochs (and I hope there  are many of you out there), Grant has written books such as &quot;12  Caesars&quot; and &quot;The Antonines&quot; &amp; some others which go into  much more detail, but have less scope (timeline wise) than the present  book.	2000-02-27

This is a book about Rome's &quot;Golden Age.&quot;  It covers the period from Antoninus Pius to Commodus (138-192 A.D.).  Antoninus Pius &amp; Marcus Aurelius (as well as Trajan &amp; Hadrian, who came shortly before)  are among the greatest of the Roman emperors.  Sadly, Commodus (Aurelius'  son) was one of the worst leaders of all time.  As a matter of fact,  Commodus was SO bad that many Romans accused his mother of infidelity as  they could not believe how such an egregious fellow could have possibly  sprung from the loins of one so noble as Aurelius.<br />  Grants' book  gives a detailed look at this epoch, as well as a glimpse at the art &amp;  literature of the time.  The book contains helpful illustrations &amp;  photographs of Roman architecture &amp; coinages of the time.<br />  This  book gives a detailed picture of one of the most pivotal moments in Roman  history.  Some would say that Roman history went downhill from the reign of  Commodus onward.  While I think that this is a slight exaggeration, there  is nonetheless evidence that this was (until Commodus) the closest that  Rome ever came to achieving their utopian &quot;Camelot.&quot;  A great  work by an astute scholar.	2000-02-27

Then again, its subject matter is recondite enough to warrant its difficult essays.  It is recommended that anyone who wishes to take on this monster first be  acquainted with philosophy as well as contemporary 20th century cosmology.  Stephen Weinberg's &quot;The First Three Minutes&quot; and Timothy Ferris'  &quot;The Whole Shebang&quot; would be good places to start before  attempting to read this book.  It would also be helpful for one to have  read at least one book on quantum mechanics (&quot;Taking The Quantum  Leap&quot; by Fred Alan Wolf would be a wise choice) as a pre-requisite.  Even having read these books beforehand, this is STILL not an easy book.<br />  What this book deals with is the First Cause argument which St.  Thomas Aquanis borrowed from Aristotle &amp; then modified for  Christianity.  The question it confronts is &quot;Why is there something  rather than nothing?&quot;  The Creationist's answer is that the answer  lies with God, the cause of all things.  The atheists counter that this  does nothing but push the question back, as then one must ask &quot;where  did God come from?&quot; (if, indeed, the universe &quot;came&quot; from  anywhere at all).  If one cannot answer this, then why not just skip a step  and say that nobody knows where the universe came from? (as opposed of  taking the seemingly superfluous step of inferring a God or gods).  William  Craig Lane defends the theistic side of the argument while Quentin Smith  takes the helm for the atheists.  Both are quite erudite &amp; it makes for  a very good match.<br />  In the 20th century, scientists used to adore the  &quot;steady state&quot; theory, which was invented by Sir Fred Hoyle, the  famous Cambridge astronomer.  Why?  you ask.  Well, in the 1920s Edwin  Hubble confirmed what Einstein's theory of Relativity had already  predicted:  the universe was either expanding or contracting (expanding, as  it turns out).  Due to the redshift, if one were to &quot;run the film  backwards&quot; the universe must have been at a single point sometime in  the remote past.  However, if this were true, it would suggest that the  universe had a beginning.  However, if this were true, one could say that  that was the moment of &quot;creation&quot; that Aristotle &amp; St. Thomas  Aquanis were talking about.  This became known as the Big Bang theory.<br />  Enter Hoyle.  Hoyle speculated that there must constantly be matter  &quot;created&quot; (for lack of a better term?) that &quot;fills in the  gaps&quot; between galaxies as they rushed away from each other.  This  became known as the &quot;steady state theory.&quot;  The theory was very  ad-hoc, but it did preserve an infintely old universe and was adopted by  over 90% of the scientists on the planet.<br />  The story took a decided turn  in the mid 1960s when Arno Penzias &amp; Ralph Wilson discovered the cosmic  microwave background (CMB), which was radiation left over from the first  instants of the incredibly hot Big Bang.  Almost overnight, Big Bang passed  the steady state theory in the HOV lane.  Today, steady state is a dead  theory.<br />  To many scientists' horror, they once again had to  grapple with the First Cause argument as applied to a finite universe.  Sir  Arthur Eddington once said &quot;I find the idea of a beginnig to the  universe repugnant.  I should like to find a genuine loophole.&quot;  Oscillating universe theory became the favorite &quot;loophole&quot; of  atheists.  However, it suffers from significant faults (as William Craig  Lane describes in this book).<br />  This is a wonderful book as the  polemics of the First Cause argument are presented on the battlefield of  cosmology rather than straight-philosophy these days.  That is as it should  be.  The book is filled with paradoxes of infinity as well as the  possiblity of the entire universe being a quantum fluctuation (virtual  particle) gone awry.  Although the bookdabbles with the Anthropic  Principle a wee bit, it is primarily focused on the question of causation.  Did God create the universe?  Or is it, as they say, turtles all the way  down? Or did the universe LITERALLY appear out of nowhere (and  nothingness)?

It also contains Cicero's thoughts on  topics such as old age and duty ethics (I wonder: how much Cicero did Kant  read?). These are the writings of one of the most influential Romans from  all time;  a man who made his imprint on the history of the discourse of  polemics.

He won the Nobel prize in physics in 1979 and has worked with such distinguished  personages as the late Richard P. Feynman.  In short, he is one of the  leading minds in his field.<br />  The First Three Minutes is an unusual  book in astronomy / cosmology because it is now over 20 years old &amp; yet  it is STILL one of the classics of the &quot;story&quot; of the universe  for the layman &amp; non-expert.  The book takes us on an exhilerating  journey all the way back to the Plank epoch (10^-43 seconds after the Big  Bang).  Weinberg also deals with Einstein's theory of Relativity (which  predicted the Big Bang), the Hubble Red Shift (the discovery that the  universe is expanding) as well as the detection of the Cosmic Microwave  Background (CMB) in the 1960's by Ralph Wilson and Arno Penzias.  All three  of these factors, plus numerous other details all form the foundation for  the way most scientists think about our universe (presently known as the  Big Bang theory).<br />  One of the things about Weinberg that I admire is  that, like Carl Sagan, he concedes that he MIGHT be wrong, but that what he  has to work with is the best paradigm available.  This is brutally honest  &amp; also quite a refreshing approach.  I tire quickly of reading science  books that are written by individuals who are so conceited as to believe  they know everything there is to know.  One certainly does not have to  worry about that type of arrogance with Weinberg.<br />  So, if you even  have a passing interest in cosmology, I would HIGHLY recommend this book.  The book may be especially appealing to many people as it is 150 pages in  &amp; out (anyone who has ever browsed the science shelf at their local  bookstore can readily see that there have been far longer books written on  this topic).  But oh, what a plethora  of info  that Weinberg furnishes in  those 150 pages!<br />All in all, this is a very readable book which deals  with a quite recondite topic.urnishes in  those 150 pages!<br />All in all, this is a very readable book which deals  with a quite recondite topic.	2000-02-26

Feynman, Kip Thorne and Hugh Everett.  He was also great friends with such  individuals as Albert Einstein &amp; Niels Bohr.  In short, his  contributions to physics have been indispensable.<br />  This present work  of his traces his life, a life that is (as the cover says) one of science.  However, one of the nice facets of this book is that it goes beyond just  the laboratory &amp; reveals the personal life of this great man.  We learn  of the moving death of his brother in WWII, his worries and concerns over  nuclear war (as well as the grapples with his conscience that he endured  over the invention of the hydrogen bomb) and many other aspects of his  life.  He also tells stories of some of his most memorable students;  not  all of these were necessarily his most gifted pupils.  Above all, Wheeler  reveals a genuine human passion that has characterized his approach to  science over the greater part of this century.  One of the best biographies  of a scientist I have ever read.	2000-02-26

If you do not have a familiarity with the foundation of QM, I would highly recommend that you first read either &quot;Taking the  Quantum Leap&quot; (also by Wolf) or some other introductory book of QM  (Rober Gilmore's &quot;Alice In Quantumland&quot; would be an excellent  choice).<br />  Wolf's present book deals with the Princeton physicist Hugh  Everett's &quot;solution&quot; to the paradox of Schroedinger's Cat.  While  it is too detailed to go into any depth here, let's just say that the  answer is that each collapse of the wave function by an observer  &quot;creates&quot; an alternate universe.  While this is an intriguing  thought, it carries with it a whole lot of metaphysical baggage.  Wolf  takes us on a guided tour of what this baggage entails.<br />  The book also  explores the possiblity of alternate universes behind the singularities of  black holes.  Although this is something which can never be proven, it is a  thought-provoking idea nonetheless.<br />  Although I think Wolf reaches a  little with his dictum of schizophrenia patients perhaps being &quot;in  touch&quot; with alternate universes, this is a valuable resource for all  those interested in QM.  If nothing else, Wolf presents a compelling  explanation of time, space and its relation to mind.  A fascinating book.	2000-02-26

It is a good series of commentaries which elucidate why philosophical atheists believe as they  do.  (When I say philosophical atheists, I am referring to people who  actually have justification for their views - there are many plenty of  people on both sides of the issue who do not).  The book covers a myriad of  traditional &quot;proofs&quot; of His existence as well as the problem of  evil, the possiblity of the afterlife, etc.  Most of the essays are of high  quality.  However, Matson's critique of the argument from design is a bit  out of date &amp; the essay on the First Cause argument is bereft of  discoveries in 20th century science (this is an important omission as the  First Cause argument is being fought on the battlefield of cosmology these  days as opposed to being confined to philosophy). For a contemporary book  on the argument from design I would suggest &quot;Universes&quot; by the  philosopher of science John Leslie.  For a much better (and also balanced)  book on the First Cause argument I would recommend &quot;Atheism, Theism  and Big Bang Cosmology&quot; by William Craig Lane and Quentin Smith.  It  does a far superior job of engaging the topic than the essay in this  book.<br /> Some of the essays also ignore trenchant counter-arguments from  theists which would make their case much more difficult to defend. Also,  the essay by Freud has largely been abandoned - even by atheists due to the  fact that psychoanalysis is an un-falsifiable doctrine &amp; therefore has  precious little worth.

I found this book very readable &amp; an excellent introduction to QM.  The other really good intro that I would recommend would be Fred Alan Wolf's &quot;Taking The Quantum Leap.&quot;  Some of the ideas of this  fascinating subject I found to be clearer in Gilmore's book....others I  thought were said with less verbosity in Wolf's book. As Gilmore's book is  told in the style of Lewis Carrol's allegory, it is a touch more pleasant  to read.....but not much. I would recommend reading them both for a  complete intro to the wonderful world of theoretical physics.  Afterwards,  I would recommend &quot;In Search Of Schroedinger's Cat&quot; by John  Gribbin and &quot;Parallel Universes&quot; (also by Fred Alan Wolf).	2000-02-26

He scrutinizes the appalling decadence that exists in our time insofar as reason is concerned.  There  are others who have written reviews of this book who have complained that  there is more to life than reason.  I would agree, and I think Sagan would,  too.  I think the point Sagan was trying to make is that this is no reason  to ABANDON reason.  As the great Princeton philosopher Walter Kaufmann once  said (paraphrased), &quot;He who turns his back on reason is like the man  who gouges out his eyes because he cannot see everything.&quot;  That, I  think, is the gist of this book.<br />  Sagan does, however, underestimate  the value of philosophy.  As with many scientists, Sagan seems to have an  inherent condescension towards the discipline.  Sagan of all people should  know that all branches of science grew out of philosophy.  Aristotle was  one of the first biologists &amp; physicists the world has ever seen.  Although he was wrong about a great many things, he contributed a great  deal to future human thought.  It would seem that philosophy deserves more  respect &amp; credit than Sagan is willing to grant it.<br />  Sagan also  overstates his thesis of science being a &quot;totally objective&quot;  enterprise.  Any philosopher of science knows all to well just how often  alterior motives, metaphysical pre-suppositions, politics and $$$ have  played too large a part in the pursuit of science.  Those who are  unacquainted with this history are encouraged to read books by Freeman  Dyson, Thomas Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend.  Even Albert Einstein, perhaps the  greatest scientist of this century, was hardly immune from this.  The most  famous example, of course, was his arbritary insertion of the  &quot;cosmological constant&quot; variable that would preserve a static,  unchanging universe.  One need only read any of Richard Dawkin's books to  see that gerrymandering in science is alive &amp; well to this day.....and  probably always will be.<br />  Granted, the ideal, utopian world of science  would be one that is entirely objective &amp; logical.  I'm sure that Sagan  did his best to help us towards that goal during his sojourn on this  planet.  However, to believe that we have come within a thousand light  years of that goal would be nothing short of hubris.<br />  But, I don't  want to end this critique on a negative note.  This is a great book for  scientists, philosophers of science as well as all others who have so much  as a passing curiousity in man's intellectual endeavor.  If I may add,  people who enjoy Sagan's books will also (I believe) enjoy the books of the  Yale biophysicist Harold J Morowitz (also available at Amazon.com).  He and  Sagan have similar styles and share a childlike wonder of the cosmos.ably always will be.<br />    Granted, the ideal, utopian world of science  would be one that is entirely objective &amp; logical.

Hart writes a gripping biography of a truly remarkable personage.<br />  One of the more noteworthy characteristics of this book  lies in its detail.  We are given an honest picture of Scipio, as well as  his family's military heritage &amp; dedication to Rome.  It would appear  that he was quite a humanitarian for his day &amp; age.  The book also  illustrates some of the mind-boggling stupid politics that could interfere  with a great general's resolve even way back then.<br />  One thing I did  not realize before reading Hart's book was that Scipio himself fought as a  junior officer at Cannae.  He was one of the precious few Roman soldiers to  escape the wrath of Hannibal that day.  Lucky for Rome he did....<br />  This is a great book &amp; a must read for any military historian or  classical scholar.  I would suggest that people read in conjunction with  this work Theodore Ayrault Dodge's biography on Hannibal for the  &quot;other side&quot; of this conflict.  Although Dodge &amp; Hart  disagree on several key points, it is still useful to get a view of the  story from an alternative angle.  Also, for those who enjoy reading about  Scipio half as much as I did, I recommend the sections on Gaius and  Tiberius Gracchus from Plutarch's &quot;Lives.&quot;  They were the  grandsons of Scipio.  Enjoy!	2000-02-23

I have no problem with that.  However, this book did not touch me.  It's supposed to be &quot;the saddest story&quot; but the characters in it were so  indifferent that I could not care enough about them to find the novel to be  tragic.<br />The story is about the wasteland of the 20th century when  seemingly all of our human passions have been sapped by a general feeling  of apathy and disinterest.  Gone are the days of the heroic warrior who  leaves his Spartan wife, hearing her whisper in his ear &quot;Return either  with your shield or on it.&quot;  Instead, we get a soap opera where all  of man's sacred virtues have been trivialized.  For instance, the chap in  the book says &quot;If I could not have her, I felt that I must at least  marry her.&quot;  The book is filled with ironic little twists like  that.<br />Supposedly, Ford subscribed to the &quot;most perfect word for each  sentence&quot; school that Gustav Flaubert was the master of.  I don't see  it.  I found his analogies so absurd that they made me break out laughing  when they were intended to make me sad.  For instance, he compares a woman  sticking out the trunk of a car to being eaten by an alligator.  Sorry, but  I don't find that very thoughtful.<br />I am not going to say this is a bad  book.  It has received too much critical acclaim to be dismissed as such.  Although I like Hemmingway, I did not like his The Sun Also Rises for much  the same reason as I hated Ford's work.  However, if you like a book where  at least SOME action takes place (and by action I do NOT mean violence), I  would not recommend this book.  Nor would I admonish anyone who likes  wonderful characterization &amp; personas to read it.  As a testament to  20th century nihilism, however, I suppose it's worth someone's while.	2000-02-23

He saw action at Gettysburg, among other places.  As a soldier, Dodge gives a unique, in-the-trenches perspective to military history that can be  lost amongst history professors who sometimes tend to view their discipline  from the ivory towers of academia.  Although this is the only book I have  read on the life of Hannibal, I cannot fathom anyone writing a more  thorough biography of this singularly extraordinary individual.  Dodge does  a great job of providing background information such as the critical error  of the Greek general Pyrrhus (why Hannibal refrained from attempting to  siege Rome after Cannae), as well as a first hand account of the most  likely route that Hannibal chose to march his army thru the Alps  (Dodge  personally visited &amp; inspected the various passages himself).  He also  furnishes us with detailed information on Hannibal's brother, Hasdrubal  &amp; his ultimate defeat by Nero.<br />  At heart, however, this book is  about the Second Punic War (also known as the war against Hannibal).  Dodge  gives us an exhilerating picture of how this man led a basically rag-tag  army of mercenaries against the greatest fighting machine the world had  ever known.....and somehow managed to win, anyway.  From his infamous  triumph over Varro at Cannae to his eventual defeat at Zama in 202 BC,  Dodge chronicles the successes and tribulations of this important  historical figure.  It is no wonder that Virgil intentionally wrote  allusions to him in The AEneid.<br />  For those who enjoy this book, I  would HIGHLY recommend the biography that B.H. Liddell Hart wrote on the  life of Scipio Africanus for a glimpse of the &quot;other side&quot; of  this struggle.	2000-02-23

The ICR (as one can probably tell) is commited  to finding evidence for design that undercuts evolution.  This is a rather  silly enterprise, and Kitcher elucidates how blatant their ad hoc reasoning  can get.  In fairness to the Creationists, however, it should be noted that  the the individuals he goes after in this book are lightweights.  Scientists and academecians who believe in God (and there are many more of  them than one might think) by and large could care less what anyone from  the ICR says.  At any rate, science should not be utilized to try and prove  God's existence, nor should it be used to disprove His existence.  Rather,  the job of science is to find out the way things are - whatever that may  be.  It is from THAT point that the arguments for and against should be  taken up - not de capo one way or the other.  The people at ICR who use it  to try and prove His existence and the Richard Dawkins types who abuse it  to prove He doesn't exist are the two extremes.  Both put the cart before  the horse.  Kitcher does a good job of debunking the ICR and their  fundamentalist following.	2000-02-23

The work which Virgil composed for this purpose was the Aeneid. It is an epic poem that tells the story of a minor character from Homer's Iliad who leads a rag-tag band from the smouldering ruins of Troy in order to found a &quot;New Troy&quot; to the west: Rome. It is in the Aeneid, not the Iliad (as most people who have not read the works tend to believe) that we see the spectacle of the Trojan Horse &amp; the famous line &quot;I do not trust Greeks bearing gifts.&quot; The Iliad ends with the death of Hektor - before the plan of the Trojan Horse is devised by Odysseus. The Odyssey picks up after the sack of Troy. The Aeneid fills in the gaps &amp; narrates the story of the few Trojans who escape the wrath of the Greeks. According to legend, Romulus &amp; Remes (the two brothers who eventually founded the city itself) were descendents of Aeneas. As is usual, Fitzgerald's translation is top notch. I have read Mandelbaum's rendition as well &amp; much prefer Mr. Fitzgerald. The book also contains a useful glossary &amp; postscript which help elucidate the allusions to Hannibal &amp; Cleopatra which the Romans of Virgil's day would have picked up right away, but which might be unfamiliar to modern day readers. Also, it is HIGHLY recommended that one read the Iliad &amp; the Odyssey before embarking on Virgil's work. [...] But, for a quick answer: the reason that Juno (Hera in the Greek) has a vendetta against Aeneas is due to the fact that he is Trojan. This all derives from the judgment of Paris when Juno was &quot;jilted&quot; by the bribe that Aphrodite offered Paris (also a Trojan). To offer any more info at this point would be too great of a digression, but what I will say is that this work is NOT (I repeat NOT) for someone to merely pick up &amp; dive into w/out doing his or her pre-requisite reading. Do your homework, become familiar with the myths &amp; tales of what has gone on before, then read the Aeneid. You will be glad you did, for this is an extraordinary epic.

That, I'm afraid, is an exagerration.  However, Stone's book is an excellent work to  read before one reads Plato.  Although it is specifically a commentary on  two of Plato's dialogues (Apology &amp; Crito), Stone furnishes his readers  with an exceptionally in-depth background on the histoy of the period which  will help any student of philosophy immensly in reading both Plato and  Aristotle.  Even though some of Stone's ideas are incorrect (such as his  underestimating just how damaging some of Aristophanes' plays were to  Socrates) the book is still a high calibre commentary &amp; has some good  insights.

While it is virtually impossible to translate Dactylic Hexameter into English, Fitzgerald still captures much of the power and majesty of Homer in his  translation.  Now, it is conceded that the Odyssey is technically inferior  to the Iliad.  It is for this reason that the majority of Homeric scholars  believe he wrote the Odyssey first, THEN the Iliad.  In any case, the  Odyssey is still an awesome piece of literature and has enjoyed an enormous  influence over all of western thought for close to 3,000 years.  It is  dubious to believe too many of today's poets / authors will still be  remembered 2,500+ years from now.  As always with classic literature, I  would admonish anyone interested in reading the Odyssey to first consult  everything that has gone before, such as the Judgment of paris &amp; the  Iliad, etc.  The tale will make SO MUCH more sense that way.  As one can  see by the negative reviews to this work, Homer is not for those who are  only interested in instant gratification.  If you cannot get interested in  a book which may take you a month to read &amp; a lifetime to truly  understand, Homer is not for you.  On the other hand, if you're really  intrigued by Greek mythology, history or literature, this book is an  ABSOLUTE must.  It is one of the great cornerstones of all western  literature.  I am quite certain that people will still be reading Homer  3,000 years from now.	2000-02-20

The mathmatician / physicist Freeman Dyson is a Professor Emeritus at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton university.  His career has distinguished him as a top notch scientist who is brilliant, insightful,  and perhaps most important, a kind and gentle fellow.  From Eros To Gaia  deals with many concerns facing scientists today.  Eros is the Greek term  for the highest love, and Gaia is the Greek name for the life-giving mother  earth.  Dyson's resolve is that we must respect both if we are to continue  are sojourn on this planet as a species.  I believe he is correct.<br />  Dyson explains how well-intentioned scientific projects get corrupted by  politics so much that their outcomes and results are many times enervated  by sundry extraneous issues and agendas.  He also discusses how he thinks  higher education could be improved via the institution of fresh approaches  and schemes.  As an added bonus, Feynman's legions of admirers will be  delighted by the stories of he &amp; Dyson's friendship.<br />This work is  filled with remarkable clarity of thought &amp; truly conveys majesty  of  this remarkable man's perspective on the world.

This is also, in my opinion, his greatest work.  His eloquent words bring to us the sense of wonder and the thoughtful nature of a truly magnificent  scientist and person.  Dyson reveals to us how his life has been influenced  by his reading children stories.  We get the opportunity to read his  reflections on World War II, the relationship he had with Robert  Oppenheimer and many other biographical tidbits which all somehow melt into  an almost unexpected thematic unity.  His adventures with Richard P.  Feynman as well as his relationship with Edward Teller are also discussed.  This amazing book explains this man's humble outlook on such subjects as  nuclear war (and its impending probablity), poetry and his own unique  interpretation of the inner-workings of the machinery of the universe.

The great Harold Morowitz once again dazzles us with his insights into science, the world and various other topics.  One caution:  despite its title, this book has only one essay that deals with the origin of life (the  essay shares the same title as the book itself).  Unlike &quot;Cosmic Joy  And Local Pain&quot; there is no thematic unity that is shared by the  subject matter of his essays.  This is by no means bad, it's just good to  know that this is NOT a series of essays which deal exclusively with the  origin of life on Earth. Morowitz writes delightful pieces on ethics in  universities, the academic standards of pre-med students (which are much  lower and driven by politics far more than I had thought possible), the  pragmatic uses of liberal arts degrees as well as other topics.  His  writing is succinct and always insightful.

Everything you have heard about the importance of Homer to all of subsequent western thought.....IT'S ALL TRUE!  Homer is the very foundation upon which everything else in western philosophy and literature  rests.  While it is impossible to capture the rhythm of Dactyllic Hexameter  in English, Lattimore's translation is nothing short of profound.  Let me  make a suggestion to anyone who is interested in reading Homer, but is not  well versed in Greek mythology.  Before beginning the ILIAD, consult a good  reference guide that will give you all of the &quot;background&quot;  information on this work (such as the judgment of Paris, the abduction (?)  of Helen, etc).  The ILIAD begins in medias res, (in the middle of things)  and provides no background info whatsoever.  Journey back to 1,200 BC to  the ninth year of the Trojan War...join the millions of readers throughout  history who have lent their imaginations to the ancient bard Homer &amp;  have come to understand the wrath of Achilles.... an anger that is by one  account rather childish, but on another so very human.

This book is at once both hilarious and horrifying.  To have a book possess both these features and still be well done is a noteworthy feat.  Well, I guess that Voltaire has accomplished a noteworthy feat.  The tale  is about a young man named Candide who was brought up under the tutelage of  a chap named Pangloss.  Pangloss is a caricature of the philosopher  Leibniz, who believed that ours' is &quot;the best of all possible  worlds&quot; because it was molded and shaped by an omnipotent creator.  The name itself is also a pun: Pan (which is Greek for &quot;all&quot;)  gloss (which is French for talk):  Pangloss = All-talk.  At any rate,  Voltaire finds out (and continues to find out) that this Pollyanna view of  life can be rather troublesome to the senses.  He experiences the horrors  of war, separation from his beloved, shipwreck, unfortunate  misunderstandings, robbery and a plethora of other misfortunes.  He also  makes it to the mythical utopia of Eldorado, only to find that it's not all  it's cracked up to be, either.  This is a first rate classic that deals  with the meaning of life, the $60,000 question &quot;Is anyone out there  really happy?&quot; as well as many delightful lesser questions.

This book is a jewel.  One would be hard pressed to find a more comical and enjoyable book to read - anywhere.  Feynman is the scientist who breaks (or should I say, shatters?) the stereotype of the lab-coat physicist who  wears thick, taped up glasses.  The great Richard P. Feynman is a testament  to how great we as a race can me.  I like to think of him as a cross  between Goethe &amp; Robin Williams (and I do NOT mean that in any sort of  deragatory way).  As a physicist, he was top notch, but as a person he was  something even more.  He had a marvelous sense of humor &amp; enjoyed  playing pranks on people.  His love of life spilled over to all the people  he met during his sojourn on the planet.  I only wish that I had been one  of those lucky few to have met &amp; known him personally.  Perhaps what is  most remarkable about him is that he had friends from all walks of life.  Many were scientists, yes, but many more were &quot;ordinary&quot; people  off the street.  That is rather noteworthy given the fact that so many Ivy  league-calibre professors feel that they too &quot;intellectually  gifted&quot; to associate with the rest of we mere mortals.  Someone once  said that Edwin Hubble wasn't a humble man, but then again, Hubble didn't  have very much to be humble about.  I would argue that one could say the  latter of Feynman as well, but not the former.  READ THIS BOOK and share  the experiences of one of the most extraordinary and yet fun loving  personages of the 20th century (if not all time).

This book does not contain anything absolutely mind-bendingly awe-inspiring,to be sure.  I readily concede that.  However, what it does possess are the witty and many times insightful thoughts on Feynman on  subjects as diverse as science, psychology (Note:  if you are a  psychologist I would not recommend this book....), politics and religion.  Perhaps the most striking feature of this book is the humility that Feynman  had.  Here is  a man who had in IQ that was off the scale, and yet he had  the utter audacity to believe that he was no smarter than the rest of this.  Whoa!  Now that's not something you see everyday!

It gives a detailed description of the predominant models of the universe presently used by scientists (with the exception of Superstring theory).  It also goes in depth into the factors that come into play which determine  why astronomers and physicists think the way they do about the origin &amp;  evolution of the cosmos.  This book covers much the same material as  Stephen Hawking's &quot;A Brief History In Time&quot; but I think Ferris'  book is a bit more lucid and easy to read.  His writing style is also not  as dry as Hawking's.  This is certainly not the only cosmology text out  there, but I believe it's one of the best.  People interested in this book  should also consider purchasing the PBS Home Video &quot;The Creation Of  The Universe&quot; (also available at Amazon.com) which is hosted by  Ferris.	2000-02-13

However, as a whole it is filled w/great information.  It is an especially good book for atheists who believe they have it all figured out.  From reading some of the negative reviews that accused Schroeder of being  a bad scientist for believing in God, I must question their reason for  reading the book in the first place (if they did, in fact read it). Also,  it seems to me that people who are so narrow minded are doing nothing more  than manipulating the terms.  In other words, to them, being a good  scientist = being an atheist.  Even if your theories are incoherent &amp;  non-sensical, you're still a great scientist so long as you disbelieve in  God.  (Richard Dawkins would be a great representative of this motif).  On  the other hand, being a believer = being a bad scientist (or pseudo  scientist).  Even if you make revolutionary insights into the nature of the  universe, but believe in God (Albert Einstein and Sir Isaac Newton would be  examples of this), you are STILL bad scientists - by default.  Now, if one  rids oneself of silly pre-suppositions such as this, he might just learn  something from Schroeder's book.  If not, then there is no reason to read  it.  Furthermore, there is no reason to read any book as it means that the  individual who subscribes to such an absurd set of &quot;rules&quot; has  closed his mind to reason.  One of the things this book does quite well is  dis-inter so much &quot;embarrasing&quot; data that the august  &quot;scientific community&quot; has decided to sweep under the rug.  The  Wistar Institute is a great example of this.  Contrary to popular belief,  science is hardly an &quot;objective enterprise seeking the truth.&quot;  To the contrary, metaphysical pre-suppositions run amok &amp; theories are  often based on them more than the data itself.  Any philosopher of science  knows this all too well.  Thoughtful people who choose to read this book  may find out as much for themselves.may find out as much for themselves.	2000-02-13

If I had my way, I would not have given it any stars at all.  If you want sophmoric drivel, then this book is for you.  The section on the argument from Design was one of the weakest I have ever read (and I have read quite  a few).  Smith did not even bother to engage the Anthropic Principle in his  book.  Since it was published in '79,  even some mentioning of it would not  seem too much to ask.  However, there is nothing on the AP at all.  This  tells me one of two things:  either Smith is ignorant of the AP (in which  he CERTAINLY should not be writing a critique of the design argument) or  the AP makes him a bit nervous &amp; fidgety.  In either case, Smith's  intellectual impotence shines thru this omission.  If Smith proves nothing  else in this book, he proves without a shadow of a doubt that he does not  understand the argument from Design.  His section on the first cause  argument is not much better.  Is it too much to ask that Smith have SOME  scientific knowledge in these matters?  If so, why is he even writing the  book in the first place?  The book is also written in an angry tone.  Evidently, some theist(s) at one time or another must have really stepped  on his toes.  That is all fine and well, but it does not excuse such a  condescending tone.  This is a lousy book &amp; it will be a long time  before Smith gains the status of amateur philosopher (if ever).	2000-02-12

To be well read means that you have read the Comedy (at least once).  At once haunting, dark and yet grotesquely beautiful, Dante has written for us the definitive Catholic epic poem of hell, purgatory and heaven.  Mark Musa  is one of the foremost Dante scholars in the world &amp; teaches at the  university of Indiana.  His footnotes &amp; commentaries are exceptional, a  trademark that is not only a luxury but is, in fact, a necessity when it  comes to Dante.  I would recommend everyone read not just the Inferno, but  all three canticles of the Comedy as a whole.  One cannot truly understand  everything in Inferno without reading thru the entire poem (including  Purgatory and Paradise).  Would also admonish that anyone interested in  this work begin with Virgil's Aeneid and also read some Homer, Plato &amp;  Aristotle as well as some Roman history for a rough background of the work.  Be advised that the bard expects you to have read everything he has so  that you will catch all of his allusions.  Once again, this is where Musa's  footnotes come in handy, but there is still no substitute for actually  reading thru the primary texts that serve as the foundation of this work.  Also, would advise that one read the short work, La Vita Nuova (The New  Life) before reading the Comedy, as it is basically a prologue to his epic.  It will also help make more sense re: the pilgrim's near-obsessive love  that he has for Beatrice.  This is truly one of the great epic poems ever  written and it positions Dante right up there with Homer, Goethe &amp;  Virgil.	2000-02-08

There are better cosmological &amp; astronomy books out there, but this one is quite good.  What I have a problem with is Gribbin's metaphysical  reaches that he utilizes to &quot;solve&quot; the Anthropic principle.  Gribbin wants us to believe the Gaia principle, which claims that the  universe is a living organism.  Not only that, but it reproduces  via black  holes.  According to Gribbin it just SO HAPPENS that the AP coincides with  the suitable conditions that are conducive to supporting life (as we know  it).  The REAL &quot;purpose&quot; of the laws of physics being &quot;just  so&quot; is that they are appropriate to the formations of big, beautiful,  bouncing baby black holes (which form the impetus of new universes).  According to Gribbin, there is a vast number of universes (perhaps an  infinite number) beyond ours'.  Now, I have no problem w/conjecture such as  this, even though Gribbin is asserting a bad hypothesis (i.e.: one that  cannot be proven or disproven).  What I take issue with is that he wants us  to believe that his theory is a logical inevitablility.  He uses phrases  such as &quot;our universe must be seen this way.&quot;  That word must is  a strong term for a theory that does not have SO MUCH AS ONE SHRED  of  proof.  Gribbin also speculates that this universe may well have been  &quot;created&quot; by a bunch of alien engineers in some other universe.  This is a rather curious statement to come from a devout atheist - to  concede that the universe shows signs of design, only the designer was  little green men instead of God.  Moreover, who is &quot;pushing the  question back&quot; now?  Gribbin hopes to validate his theory of multiple  universes by dressing it in scientific jargon, but in the end it is nothing  more than atheistic gerrymandering.  Gribbin would have us to believe that  there are an infinite number of universes in order to justify the laws of  this one being &quot;just so perfect&quot; to support life.

For those who may not be familiar w/QM, it is the physics of the microcosmic world of electrons, photons, protons &amp;  neutrons.  It is where Newtonian causality breaks down, where there appears  a &quot;totally new ballgame.&quot;  Gribbin does an excellent job of  writing for the layman, especially considering the recondite nature of the  topic.  However, I would recommend anyone interested in QM to read Alice In  Quantumland by Robert Gilmore first as it is slightly more accessible &amp;  also has the advantage of being &quot;fun&quot; to read (it is told as an  allegorized story). Note that I still recommend Gribbin's book, but AFTER  one has read Gilmore's. It may help to make Gribbin's book make a bit more  sense.  All in all, though, this is an enlightening work.	2000-02-07

This book is the single greatest achievement of American literature.  It is the one work that stands alone &amp; can go toe to toe with all other countries' greatest authors without flinching.  Moby Dick can hold its own  against the likes of Homer, Goethe, Dante, Milton, Shelley and Virgil and  take its place as one of the great classic literary epics of all time.  However, as one of the other reviewers put it, it is not for everyone.  Even some people who are really &quot;into&quot; literature may not care  for this fine novel.  That is simply because never has a book been written  that has pleased absolutely everyone, without exception.  But, I think the  biggest reason many people don't care for Moby Dick is due to the fact that  so many these days have short attention spans &amp; prefer fast-food type  novels whose plot can be summed up on the back of an envelope.  If that is  your type of book, carry on, sailor - this book is NOT for you.  On the  other hand, if you have an inquisitive mind that enjoys powerful  allegories, then this book is for you!  I like to think of Moby Dick as an  Americanized re-telling of Milton's Paradise Lost.  However, the best thing  about the novel is not whether I'm right or wrong so much as the  extraordinary range and scope of interpretations that are possible.  If you  read one single novel the rest of your life, read Moby Dick.  If you read  more than one novel the rest of your life, read Moby Dick first.	2000-02-06

That may make my review of this book a bit slanted.  For those who may not be familiar w/Hyaptia, she was a  neo-Platonic philosopher / astronomer / physicist / mathmatician (among  other things) at the library of Alexandria shortly before it was burned to  the ground by an angry mob.  To back up: the library of Alexandria was the  idea of one Alexander the Great.  Although he never lived to see it,  Alexander wanted a place where scholars from all over the world &amp; from  all cultures could come together &amp; share knowledge.  The dream was  realized when one of his generals built the library.  It is also good to  keep in mind that had the library not been burned down (according to the  late Carl Sagan the building had over 1 million scrolls at its height), we  would likely have made it to the moon long before 1,000 A.D.  The amount of  scientific, literary and historical texts and data that were lost is  nothing less than astounding.  Hypatia was one of the last teachers to work  at the library before its untimely destruction.  It is said that she had  the form of Aphrodite &amp; the spirit of Plato.  A truly remarkable woman,  she excelled in sundry fields of intellectual endeavor at a time when women  were supposed to be silent &amp; were thought of as stupid.  Read this  book, especially you ladies in the world.  Hypatia is a testament to the  human greatness that lies in the heart of us all.	2000-02-06

Given the nature of the subject-matter of the book, it is difficult to find any books at all that are truly  objective.  Darwinists will enter into the subject with presuppositions  that their theory is correct and will many times ignore any evidence to the  contrary.  Creationists will many times believe in a literal reading of the  book of Genesis and will reject the ideas of anyone who says otherwise.  Both sides accuse the other of being closed minded and practicing bad  science.  To a degree, perhaps both are right.  This book does about as  good a job as one could ever (objectively) do to clear up some  misunderstandings that both sides have in regards to the other.  The  reviewer from California has obviously made up his mind which side of the  fence he has sat on, and that is fine.  However, to merely say that there  really is no debate at all &amp; that the Darwinists have already won is, I  think,  a mistake.  Anyone who is as closed minded as that need not read  this book, for the whole point of the book is to take a disinterested look  at the (many times fallacious)ideas of both sides.  And if the argument is  so clear cut as the Californian says, why is it that none other than the  Harvard paleontologist Stephen J. Gould has written that &quot;the extreme  rarity of transitional forms in the fossil record&quot; are the &quot;trade  secret of paleontology&quot;?  Darwin himself said that if there was even  so much as one instance where transitional forms were not found, his theory  would prove null and void.  The great physicist Richard P. Feynman once  said that the &quot;core of science&quot; is this:  &quot;When you find an  exception to a rule, the rule is wrong.&quot;  What is it that makes  Darwinism exempt from this principle, I ask?  Moreover, if Darwinism is so  very straight forward, why do Gould and Niles Elderidge feel it necessary  to resort to such an ad-hoc theory as punctuated equilibrium?  Now, to be  fair, the creationists for their part have used a multitude of logical  fallacies and fudge factors over the years to make their idealogies  &quot;work.&quot;  That is the point of Ratzche's book; to point out the  flaws of each side.  All that I am saying is that reading this book with a  closed mind (either way) would be a waste of time.

It is not the first such attack, and I am quite sure it will not be the last.  The subtitle suggests that its scope will cover sundry branches of science (Metaphysical  Foundations of the Disunity of science).  However, that is a bit  misleading.  The primary discipline which Dupre engages is biology, with a  few references (in passing) to quantum mechanics along the way.  Not that  this is bad, mind you, but those who are looking for a book that deals with  the philosophy of science in general as opposed to just biology should look  elsewhere.  Overall, I found this a rather boring book.  Not a bad book,  but boring.  It seemed to be on the redundant side &amp; I can pretty much  sum-up its thesis in one sentence:  there are too many variables at work  for reductionism to be a plausible working paradigm in the taxonomy of  species.  Dupre believes that too many times the classification of species  is not as straightforward as one would think, but are instead based on the  personal preferences of biologists rather than on barriers supplied by  Nature.  In other words, all (or most all) boundaries imposed by scientists  to categorize species are inconsistant and are at best artificial.  The  faults of Reductionism are nothing new anyone involved in the philosophy of  science, but Dupre does do a good job of expanding on and giving his own  spin to some of the more trenchant objections to the paradigm.  All in all,  I would only suggest this book if one has a keen interest in either biology  or the philosophy of science.  A lack of enthusiasm in either of these  areas is likely to make this book a tedious read.	2000-01-08

For those of you who have not done so already, I would highly recommend reading Marlowe's &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's &quot;Faust&quot; before taking this one on.  It will make more  sense that way and will also provide a remarkable opportunity to see the  evolution of a wonderful myth.  Now, to attempt to summarize a masterpiece  like this in a few words is absurd, but I will do my best.  Marlowe's Faust  is the most straightforward of the three (not that it is not a great work  of literature itself, mind you).  Faust is an absolutely brilliant  character who is so brilliant, in fact, that he is bored with life.  So he  makes a deal with Mephistopheles (one of Satan's demons) that he will have  25 years of almost omnipotence, being able to do anything and possessing  almost god-like powers.  However, when the 25 years are up, his soul will  belong to the devil.  Goethe's Faust is one of the top 5 or so greatest  exemplars of literature ever written.  It is, quite simply, astounding.  In  short,  the plot is kinda/sorta the same, only in Goethe there is no time  limit in the agreement with Mephistopheles.  Rather, at the point when  Faust ceases to press on and becomes sedentary, the devil has him.  It is  the moment in which Faust utters &quot;Stay, moment, stay....thou art so  fair&quot; that he will be doomed.  I do not want to say anything more  about Goethe's Faust so that I can refrain from giving anything away.  At  any rate, enter Thomas Mann with a 20th century twist on the myth. Adrian  Leverkuhn sells his soul to the devil for a new form of music.  Satan  grants his wish and gives him Schoenberg's 12 tone.  (Of course, it is  Leverkuhn's 12 tone in the novel).  For Mann, this was symbolically a  representative of how 20th century man sells his soul to the devil;  it is  thru the trivialization of art.  The 12 tone, although a brilliant  conception, is none-the-less something other than music for Mann (and for  myself, if I may add).  Mirrored to Leverkuhn's fate is the seduction of  the German people by Adolf Hitler.  Hitler promised them  great glories and  a feeling of invincibility.  For a brief time (like in a Faustian pact) he  delivered on his promise.  However, in the end, the Germans paid dearly for  their hubris.  The end of the war brought along with it the destruction of  Her Dresden China;  Dresden, the very cultural and artistic heart and soul  of Germany, was all but destroyed.  This book is truly an epic and is not  for leisure or light reading.  However, it is a must for anyone interested  in the Faustian myth, World War II, German history, Thomas Mann or any  combination thereof.  A tremendous novel.may add).

Not only that, it is perhaps the only book that I know of that is endorsed by BOTH atheists and theists alike.  Yep, that's right boys and girls.  Quentin Smith is one of the most die hard  atheists on the planet and Peter Van Inwagen of the university of Nortre  Dame is one of the biggest defenders of theism.  Both rave about this book  and their comments can be read on the back cover.  So, what is this book  all about, you ask?  Well, it's something known as the Anthropic Principle.  It was first introduced in the early 1970s by a physicist by the name of  Brandon Carter.  It basically states that we are not just lucky to be here,  but rather we are REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY lucky to be here.  Why?  Because from the first instant of the big bang onward, an incredible and  highly improbable slew of things HAD to go right in order for the  possibility for life to exist anywhere in the universe.  So much so that it  seems that the universe was &quot;fine tuned&quot; just for life.  Sir Fred  Hoyle (an atheist) was led to comment that the universe looks like a  &quot;put up job.&quot;  Now, this set of circumstances led to a  ressurection of the Argument from Design by the theists with renewed  vehemence.  Meanwhile, the atheists have their own responses, which  basically take up two camps.  First Response (also known as the Weak  Anthropic Principle or WAP):  &quot;Of course the universe has laws which  allow life to exist.  If they didn't we would not be here.  Therefore, the  odds are irrelevant except perhaps for some latenight philosophic mental  gymnastics.&quot;  Now, there is a problem with this response in that it is  nothing more than a tautology.  That is to say, it does not EXPLAIN why the  universe supports life despite so many constricted laws of physics and  chemistry.  It is like someone asking why the Dallas Cowboys won the  superbowl and having a person respond &quot;because they scored more points  than the other team.&quot;  That answers nothing.  The question is:  WHY  did they win?  Were they better than the other team?  Did they get lucky?  Did they have a better coach?  Did the other team have injuries?  Were  turnovers a factor?  etc. etc.  Saying that &quot;they scored more  points&quot; only states the obvious: &quot;of course they scored more  points, or else they would not have won the game...&quot;  Now, the second  camp is known as the Strong Anthropic Principle (SAP) and it goes something  like this:  &quot;Since the odds of our existing in a universe with the  PRECISE physical laws necessary for us to do so are so slim as to be  intellectually unacceptable (in the order of 10^10^123 according to Roger  Penrose) there must then be a whole slew of other universes (perhaps an  infinite number) to JUSTIFY this one.  That is to say, in an infinite  number of universes, virtually anything can happen.  The majority of them  would have random, weird laws of physics and be lifeless but EVERY SO OFTEN  you would get one which could support life (in some form or another).&quot;  Now, this is an interesting argument, but it has a fatal flaw.  There is  not a SHRED of evidence that even one other universe exists besides our  (much less an infinte number of them).  Yet they seem to HAVE to exist in  order for the numbers to come out right.  Hence, if one chooses to believe  in these alternate universes (no matter what his scientific credentials) he  MUST do so on faith alone.  Obviously, most atheists are not comfortable  with this conclusion, but that is the way it goes.  Leslie's book engages  the subject objectively and he tells wonderful, fun stories that offer both  the atheist (multiple universe) and theistic (one universe with a designer)  perceptions of the debate.  A remarkable book.  I think that Mr. Pierson  missed the point when he read it as it is not about Darwinian evolution at  all (nor does Leslie ever say it is).  It is well worth reading the whole  thing, too.  What Mr. Pierson said about atheists being willing to believe  in multiple universes but are not willing to believe in God is precisely  one of Leslie's points.  However, I also would endorse the other books that  Mr. Pierson recommended as I have read them too.  Also, I would suggest for  those who like this book Atheism, Theism and Big Bang Cosmology by Quentin  Smith and William Craig Lane., too.

One of the most striking things I have discovered about the vehement critiques of this book both at the Amazon  website as well as other Behe websites is the alarming degree of hatred and  resentment that has been displayed by Behe's fellow scientists.  Now,  whether Behe is right or wrong is beside the point when one just considers  how his attackers have chosen to respond to his book;  using mere ad  hominum tactics does not instill in me a sense of confidence in Behe's  adversaries' actually knowing what they are talking about.  After all, when  one feels compelled to do nothing more than hurl insults at the author of a  book instead of actually taking the time to engage the argument of the  book, that tells me that the critic has an insecurity complex.  And that is  precisely what the majority of Behe's peers have done;  they have basically  said &quot;How DARE he challenge Darwinian natural selection? &quot;  As the late Carl Sagan said so vociferously so many times, science is  SUPPOSED to be an open forum for discussion.  No matter how smart a person  is or what his or her credentials are, no one view is supposed to be  categorically accepted or categorically rejected without due process.  Categorically rejecting Behe's theory of IC and trying to attack him  personally tells me just how little so many of these  &quot;professional&quot;scientists actually know about science.<br />Now, I  would like to answer all of the reviewers who complained that Behe did not  present his case to his scientific colleagues but instead wrote a book for  the general public &amp; thereby bypassed his colleagues.  Well, I have a  question for you:  how many of you Darwinists have heard of the Wistar  Institute?  I would imagine very few, unless you read about it in Behe's  book.  I have read about it elsewhere in other books &amp; have always  found it curious that so few people are aware of this discussion from the  late 1960s.  What Wistar was was a forum that put together many of the  world's best biologists together with the world's best mathmaticians.  It  was designed to prove the mathmatcial validity of Darwinian natural  selection.  It was, however, a complete distaster.  The odds proved so  enormous that Darwinism seemed to be mathmatically impossible. Wistar was  thereby shoved into the closet &amp; hidden because it was an embarrasment  to the Darwinists.  Now, I ask the question:  was Wistar bad science(like  so many evolutionists have called Behe's book?).  If so, WHY?  One thing is  for certain;  nobody can accuse the scientists involved in Wistar to be  Creationists - they were atheists to a last man, for heaven's sake.  It was  most definetly not a conspiracy in which the outcome was jury-rigged.  Now,  for all I know, some reason may preclude mathmatics from being a reliable  tool to use in discussions of Darwinian natural selection.  But if so, it  must be PROVED thus.  To date, all I have read of this critique of  Darwinism have been strawman arguments that state that: well, just because  it is highly improbable does not mean it can't happen by chance.  After  all, what are the odds of getting a winning hand in a poker game? Arguments  like these (most famously instituted by pro-Darwinians such as Doolittle)  grossly miss the point.  The point is not that it is highly improbable but  rather that the odds are so astronomical as to make the plausibility  impossible.  Now, to give an example:  according to the laws of quantum  mechanics, if all of the atoms on the moon had exactly the same spin at  exactly the same second, the moon COULD leave it's orbit from the earth.  This is a probabalistic fact.  However, the point is, it WON'T.  Even  though it is mathmatically possible, it is realistically impossible because  the moon has too many atoms to make this feat plausible.  The same goes for  the odds of Darwinian evolution happening just so in the mere 4 &amp; a  half billion years (or so) that the earth has been around.  Now, I ask the  question, yea hardcore Darwinists: why is it that the Wistar Institute does  not warrant even so much as a footnote on any collegiate or high school  biology text in the world?  After all, if it had shown so much as a shred  of evidence that Darwinism was mathmatically acceptable, I GUARANTEE you  that it would be in EVERY student's biological textbook and would be as  familiar to the layman's vocabulary as Einstein's theory of Relativity.  Is  this not a double-standard?  If the scientists at Wistar were wrong (they  could have been) then they must be PROVEN wrong.  However, after 30 years,  as MIT theoretical physicist Gerald Schoeder has attested, the odds have if  anything gone UP. I find it rather fascinating that the same neo-Darwinists  who find their paradigm so mathematically credible do not stay up at night  with dark thoughts about the moon leaving the orbit of the Earth.  So,  where am I going with this, you ask?  Well, this is my point:  if the  scientific community is and was unwilling to accept the findings of it's  own old-boy-club happy-as-can-be atheists, how in the world do you expect  them to pay attention to a molecular biologist who dares to mention the  dirty G word?  I think that Behe deserves some slack on this one.  That  is, unless you believe in the double-standards that Sagan so vehemently  wanted to jettison from the realm of science....o make this feat plausible.

US	51362690	R22RLEA7Y65HPA	0812692705	673157465	Cosmic Beginnings and Human Ends: Where Science and Religion Meet	Books	5	19	19	N	N	A great read for theist, atheist, agnostic and skeptic alike	To make clear what this book is:  it is a collection of essays that were typed from speeches given at a convention on science and religion.  It's uniquness lies in its objectivity and honesty concerning the issue of the  relationship between these two spheres of influence.  It includes a wide  range of contributors, including scientists, biologists, philosophers and  even a brain surgeon.  This is NOT simply a bunch of creationists  attempting to plead their case. I am a Christian, but I find much of the  literature that comes out of the Institute for Creation Research to be full  of ad-hoc reasoning and generally simple minded (not to mention bad  science).  This book is nothing like the poor representations of science to  come out of the ICR.  In fact, I know that at least one of the  contributors, Timothy Ferris of the university of California Berkeley, is  an agnostic &amp; not even a believer.  The book also includes an essay by  John Leslie, who is the definitive authority on the Anthropic Principle.  The greatest attribute of this book is that it is not so much about trying  to make you believe or disbelieve in God, but rather that it makes one  genuinely ponder the question.  I have met many atheists and theists alike  who have never truly done this.  For the believers, it is also inspiring to  find that (contrary to popular belief) there are plenty of reputable  scientists out there who believe in God &amp; have justifiable reasons for  doing so.  In fact, if anything, the trend seems to be that there is  actually a growning number of them.  A truly wonderful book.	1999-11-08
