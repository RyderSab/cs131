The measurement process presented is a great template for getting to CMM level 4 or 5.  As a software engineering manager concerned with quality, measurement and metrics I found this book to be worthy of including in our workgroup library and using it for the development of a measurement process.  I highly recommend it.	2004-07-13

This book and the architecture methodology it describes is rich in detail and based on sound principles.<br />Every major best practice in architecture is included: structure, discreet layering, separation of concerns, technical accuracy, and business focus.  The company I word for uses the 4+1 architecture methodology, which is not far off from the methodology given in this book.  I've found a lot of ideas in this book that I can use on the job without violating our comoany standards, and I am sure that as time goes on I'll discover more because I refer to this book a lot.<br />If you want to complain about writing I recommend changing careers to something more suitable like writing novels. If you want to keep current in architecture and best practices read this book.	2004-07-02

What I received is a book that is uneven in editing and content, and next to worthless as a &quot;Practical Guide&quot;.  There are some areas in the book that are worthwhile, but on the whole this book is out of touch with contemporary practices in enterprise architecture and how to approach it.<br />My advice is to avoid this book.  A more realistic, realworld and practical approach to architecture can be found in &quot;IT Architecture Toolkit&quot; by Jane A. Carbone, ISBN 0131473794.	2004-06-15

Don't be fooled by that perception.  I gave this book to my team with a mandate that it serve as a framework for usability for all corporate intranet projects. I was immediately deluged with protests from a few team members claiming &quot;we already do this&quot;.  <br />Skeptical, I sat with those who made the claims, and we compared our techniques against those this excellent book proposes using live web pages on our intranet.  Surprise.  We did not measure up, and were certainly not &quot;already doing this&quot;.<br />Phase two, I had one member of my team reengineer one of the smaller internal web sites on our intranet using the techniques given in this book.  Business users gave the results high marks, and my team began accepting the book as the official usability guide.<br />Result:  this book has made a measurable difference in the quality of internal web sites we are designing and deploying for various lines of business within our corporation.  It is now embraced by my team, and is used as a standard of good practice in web usability.  The advice provided in the book has also resulted in less support calls to our team, freeing them to work on design and deployment instead of answering end user questions.<br />Moral:  do not let the surface simplicity of this book fool you.  While its contents and advice may seem obvious, chances are that your team is not following those obvious design rules.	2004-06-01

I am one of the legions of IT managers who by association has contributed to the mess Carr so accurately portrays.  This book in on the mark.  IT is too technology focused.  Worse, IT is blind to its own faults and fails to see that the technology we use and the services we provide are commodities as Carr claims.<br />Make no mistake, Carr does not make claims that technical innovation is unimportant, nor does he claim that technology properly applied is useless.  At issue is the way that technology is misused, which goes back to the fact that IT is so focused on technology that business suffers from unfulfilled promises, application of technology to non-problems, and plain arrogance of those who are supposed to be providing services and solutions to support business imperatives.<br />This book is must reading by the CxO community.  It should wake up the business executives to the fallacies foisted upon them by IT to the point where CIOs and senior IT executives will be held accountable for how well they support business initiatives instead of how technically advanced their shops are.  To that end the fact that this book is published by Harvard Business School Press, meaning that it stands a chance of being read by outsiders who do have the power to demand changes in IT, is one of the valuable aspects of this work.<br />Summarizing, this book is about chronic problems that plague most IT shops, and is also about looking at IT in a more objective way.  Do not expect solutions because they are in short supply in this book, but do expect an honest look at the way IT has diverged from being a business support function to being a money pit for corporate resources.  Also expect to see technology and IT services placed in their proper context, with all of the hype and mystery stripped away.	2004-05-30

Some parts of this chapter are easy to implement and others not so easy. This is due to the lack of discipline in many agile groups more than unrealistic advice from the author.  <br />Easy and necessary:  supporting the agile principle of welcoming changing requirements, CM gives the team the ability to control configuration using tools and processes in the book.  Delivering *working* software frequently requires a robust CM program so the right components are in the build. This also supports the agile principle that working software is the primary measure of progress.  There is too many opportunities for error and rework when CM is not used.<br />Necessary, but not necessarily easy: build projects around motivated people is an agile principle.  The problem is too many developers who have embraced agile development think it means getting rid of process.  Agile is a process itself, and if you are to deliver working software frequently you need discipline where discipline is needed.  CM is one critical area where this holds true.  Motivating developers who are sloppy and convincing them that certain processes like CM are essential is the most difficult task to be faced.<br />I've worked in CMM level 3 shops, and am now managing an Agile team, so I've seen this from both ends.  In both shops the key to success was CM.  Until this book there was next to nothing written about it, and now that this book is available the agile developer and manager have something to guide them.  This book will explain how to implement the process, which is something the CVS book does not do well because it is more about using a tool.	2004-04-17

The book does an outstanding job living up to that description.  It goes deep into the pro's and con's of common methods of log analysis, cookie management and page tags, and shows how to develop tools and techniques to analyze information from these sources.<br />What it does not do is cover search engines or marketing analytics.  Nothing about this book's description mentions those, and anyone who confuses search engine optimization with serverside traffic analysis does not understand web analysis. Search engine optimization is all about using key words in sites and bidding for key words with search engine providers and is a strategy.  Web traffic analysis is how you go about proving that your search engine optimization stratgey works as planned. The book does cover this.  On page 17 is a great explanation of how to use the HTTP request called cs(referer) to get search engine information that includes where the request came from and the query. The same goes for marketing analytics.  Web traffic analysis is an enabler, but most of the tools and techniques for true analytics are either third party software or services.  This should set your expectations about what this book is and isn't.<br />For the web professional who is seeking an understanding of web traffic and the way to use available tools to make intelligent assumptions about visitors and their behavior this book will be greatly helpful.  The way the book discusses common problems like cache, proxy servers, HTTP shortcomings, and what can and cannot be gleaned from logs and other methods is excellent information.<br />Best practices using a few large sites helps to understand traffic analysis, how the big guys handle privacy and track users.  All in all this is an outstanding book that I learned a lot from.  Highly recommended.	2004-04-16

Every project manager will benefit from the advice in this book, as will business users and technical team members.  It's also easy to read and is beautifully illustrated with graphs and charts that give meaning to points that they author makes.<br />While some may criticize this book using unsupported opinion remember that those who can do and those who can't teach.

It's out of date, but even when it was new it would justify my opinion.  <br />It attempts to cover too wide an area of subjects, and manages to either state the obvious (as in the first chapters that make a sophmoric attempt to define e-commenrce), to display questionable knowledge on the part of contributing authors, as in the section that lamely attempts to discuss architecture.  The section on architecture should have been written by someone who could write and who understood architecture. Unfortunately I got the impression that the authors had neither qualifications.<br />The case studies were interesting, but were not sufficiently insightful to warrant buying this book that those alone.<br />There are positives to this book though.  It weighs nearly 6 pounds, making it suitable as a doorstop.  Having photos of all of the authors who contributed on the front cover is helpful if you conduct interviews since it helps in the screen process in case one of them shows up for an interview or tries to come in as a consultant.<br />My advice is to avoid this book. There are much better ones that cover the subjects in it.	2002-10-27

What is important, since they are changing our lives is not the technology, but rather, the potential.  This book has nothing to do with processors, Moore's Law and bus architecture, yet it has everything to do with what you get when you take those and build machines and connect them into a pervasive network.  <br />It's all about social impact, the undelivered promises of the technology, and debunking conventional thought (assumptions, really) about the value computers and networks bring to society.  This is certainly a book for policy makers in business and government, educators and socially-aware technoligists.<br />After you're read this excellent, thought-provoking book, read &quot;World Without Secrets: Business, Crime and Privacy in the Age of Ubiquitous Computing&quot; by Richard Hunter.

Since most experienced DBAs have already amassed their tools, this book is for the newer DBA.  It will give you a ready made collection of the basic scripts, which you can modify and perfect as your experience grows.<br />I like this collection because it allowed me and my team to bundle production ready scripts into an application that we developed for internal company use. Although me and most of my team were DBAs in the past out personal script collections were out of date.  We bought this book, tailored the scripts we needed to production tasks to support our application and were able to release a turn key application to production.  Since the scripts were provided on CD ROM and were relatively bug free this book saved us hundreds of development hours and allowed us to deliver a system that had a higher value than one that is tossed into production.<br />If you're a new DBA this book and the scripts that come with it will kickstart your tool library.  If you're a developer that is building an Oracle application and want to deliver a complete solution this book will save time and money.	2002-06-02

The detailed discussion of IP version 4 upon which the internet is based (and its many limitations), and IP version 6, which has enough address space to assign 4 IP address to each square inch of this planet's surface, is excellent. I like the comparisons and contrasts, and the discussion of barriers to implementing IP version 6.<br />This is a book with a narrow look.  Because it is narrow it goes deeply into the necessary details and is essential if you are involved with designing or deploying mobile IP.	2002-06-02

The collection is divided into foundation material, concepts and implementation.  The book has a fourth section, but it's an appendix that lists the author bios.<br />The papers in this book are based on presentations given at two ECOOP'98 workshops: the Workshop on Distributed Object Security and the Workshop on Mobility: Secure Internet Mobile Computation. Unlike many books that are based on workshops and lecture notes, this one is more practical than academic.  I like the fact that XML and Java are covered, and found the papers that deal with access controls filled with useful information.  The paper by Blaze, Feigenbaum, Ioannidis, and Keromytis on the role of trust management in distributed systems, and Roth's paper on mutual protection of cooperating agents gave information that me and my team used to solve a design problem.<br />Like most collections of computer science lecture notes the writing is vastly different from more popular books, but the information is there if you're willing to dig through dry writing.  Also, this book is not for programmers who either don't have a computer science degree or are not familiar with computer science and software engineering.	2002-06-02

That said, this isn't the Greek Tragedy that some seem to imply, nor is it a realistic account of David versus Goliath in the strictest sense.<br />First, Mr. Schooley brought much of the mess on himself.  Not for raising the issues and bringing them to the attention of Merrill Lynch's management, but for hiding behind a facade of ethics and integrity while refusing to meet the company's internal investigators half way.  Would that have compromised his ethics or integrity?  I don't believe so.  <br />Merrill Lynch's first responses seemed to include a sincere effort to resolve the complaints to the satisfaction of all.  While Mr. Schooley refused to budge from his demands which he claims were based on integrity, he also had strange ideas about integrity. While he was rolling dice with his family's future by rocking the boat, he neglected to let his wife in on what he was doing.  That is deceit, not integrity and is only different from adultery is degree.<br />Second, this book is supposed to be evidence placed in the court of public opinion.  Yes, the public will side with Mr. Schooley because we always root for the underdog and he was treated unfairly.  If he thinks that this book will make a difference in Merrill Lynch's bottom line I contend that he's naive.  The public will do what the public does.  They'll feel sorry for him, but will not hesitate for a second to follow Merrill Lynch's investment advice if it'll make them money. That's the way life works.<br />Third, I take issue with the claims made by Mr. Schooley and the attorney who wrote the forward that arbitration is a bad thing.  From personal experience I think arbitration is useful, especially in our society where we litigate at the drop of the hat.  Of course an attorney is going to oppose arbitration because in most suits the only winners are the attorneys.<br />I do recommend this book because does have lessons to be learned.  What those lessons mean is up to you. The story reads well in spite of bogging down in places in the beginning. It has the usual metaphors reported by others: Greek tragedy, Biblical David versus Goliath, and the more philosophical Good vs. Evil.  It even has a bit of Karmic irony. After Mr. Schooley's life started falling apart which included a divorce his ex-wife went to work for Merrill Lynch.  What it doesn't have is anything that will cause the same outrage as the Enron debacle. You'll have to look elsewhere for that kind of story.	2002-06-01

By containing the scope and objectives to the major leap from ad hoc (level 1) to repeatable (level 2) and from there to defined (level 3) you can concentrate on achieving firm milestones that will lead to these levels.<br />Where other books on the CMM get sidetracked on nice to know, but not essential information, this stays on track, squarely aimed at achieving the targets.  You get policies, process flows and procedures for each KPA, as well as a transition plan and questionnaires.  In short, all of the important artifacts to get you from level 1 to 2, or from level 2 to 3. These artifacts cover the entire implementation cycle from how to start to final assessment.<br />If you are serious about attaining level 2 or 3, not only will this book save time and prevent false starts and retracing steps, but the companion CD ROM, \\"HOW TO IMPLEMENT THE CMM - SOFTCOPY DOCS\\" will save even more time because all of the artifacts are provided in MS Word, Excel and PowerPoint formats.	2002-05-30

This book heavily uses the BridgePoint tool suite from Project Technology as its basis. Knowing that up front is important because the content is specific to that set of tools.  You can get eval copies of the tool suite from the vendor, and should be able to get them from the book's supporting web site, which was not fully operational at the time of this review.<br />The backbone of the book is model driven architecture, which is a strong and practical way to approach design and development.  In a nutshell, the BridgePoint tool suite, which consists of modeling and translation tools, allows you to 'draw' the design, using UML, to produce domain partitions, state charts, class diagrams and action specifications.  The tool checks your design for consistency and correctness, then the translation tool turns your design into executable code.  This is code generation on steroids.  <br />Because this book uses a specific product it is most useful to BridgePoint tool users or those who are evaluating this tool set.  If you are not in either audience you will probably be disappointed with the book. If you are in either audience, this book is excellent and justifies the 5 stars I am awarding it.	2002-05-22

This book is about those tools, so if you are not going to use them don't get this book.<br />The authors do not mess around.  They introduce the basics, then very quickly jump into design, development and testing. If you're a developer you'll appreciate the lack of fluff and the fast pace.  The book lives up to its title in all respects and is outstanding for anyone who needs realistic information about developing mobile applications using proven tools and techniques.	2002-05-22

What I liked about the book was the concepts and the attempt to develop a notation for expressing them.  What I didn't like was the wordiness and inscrutabile writing style and the complete lack of reference to work done by Ronald G. Ross, which had a growing following.  In addition, the unwillingness to use standard notation, like UML or even IDEF0, further relegated the good ideas in this book to obscurity.  <br />Reasons to consider alternatives:<BR>* the book is conceptual, not actionable<BR>* it's been overcome by business rules, which were in existence when it was written, but ignored by the author (or he was unaware of the existing work)<BR>* poor writing ...

Before this book I spent hundreds of hours researching business rules on the internet and still didn't get the detailed material that this book contains.  I agree with other reviewers that you can use this book to base a business rules implementation on, and you can also use it to teach business rules to your team.  I think it has a perfect balance of implementation, concept and practical information and recommend it to anyone who is interested in business rules.  I skimmed through the Morgan book that others have recommended and like it too, but it is basic and will not help you in implementation.  This (von Halle) book is the one to get and it's  the most complete book on the subject available.	2002-05-15

If you're an experienced architect or have a software engineering background you'll appreciate the magnificent work John Viega and Gary McGraw has done by showing the security risks in software development and giving realistic advice about how to deal with them.<br />Every chapter contained information that got me thinking about the way my group develops software and what we've been overlooking, and many of the suggestions in this book have been added to our process.  I've personally been influenced deeply by this book and mave made it mandatory reading in our development group.  For those who advise against the book I can only conclude that they either don't get it, or they don't have the experience and training to appreciate what the authors have written.  That may account for why there is so much insecure software written today, because if this book is read and followed software would be greatly more secure.  I want to congratulate the authors for a job well done.  I highly recommend this book!	2002-04-12
US	43157566	R3OAQ1K6CMS16K	0849398339	180100866	Software Testing and Continuous Quality Improvement	Books	5	8	10	N	N	Perfect balance of information and techniqies	You'd have to download over a gigabyte of internet resources, then cross-reference them to come anywhere close to having a resource as valuable as this book.  Lewis has taken proven techniques spanning both software testing and SQA, wrapped them into a quality process based on the PDCA model and places all of the information you need to master testing and SQA between the covers of this outstanding book.  <br />All you need to add is the ability to think.  If you can do that you'll be able to transform the incredible amount of information in this book into action.  If you do that I guarantee you that you'll be able to develop a world class quality organization.  <br />Of course, you can mine the publicly available resources and sort through them.  Before you do, think carefully about how much your time is worth and just how much you can absorb.  If you're intelligent enough to understand this book, you'll quickly see that you'll save thousands of manhours.  If not, you still need this book because approach will make you think in terms of cost/benefit.  <br />The forms and checklists in this book alone are worth many times the price.	2002-04-12

Where the more traditional methods for scalability and performance are more scientific and will give more confidence in the end results they are usually cast aside because developers do not understand them.  With this book they have no excuse.  The methods given are easy enough to be understood by code jockeys, and effective enough to be used by software engineers working with tight deadlines.<br />This book is valuable for other reasons too.  The author obviously understands the Java development environment and its pros and cons, and also knows databases.  Any developer who reads this book will come away with a better understanding of web application design and development, and will also understand the backend systems, such as relational databases, XML and web services.	2002-04-08

Contains one of the most authoritative collections of essays and whitepapers on the subject between two covers.  I have used this book as a basis for component-based development, and have also used it as the foundation for a SQA initiative because the material also addresses quality. Many of the essays support a software reuse strategy, which is an added bonus.  Another use of this outstanding book is as a resource for in-house training in many aspects of software engineering outside of the component-based domain. It's that comprehensive and complete.  I recommend using this book with Successful Software Development as the two primary references in mature development organizations.	2001-12-25
US	43157566	RFWFHVV91IALR	013829755X	984811800	Developing Software to Government Standards	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Still useful	This book is all about 2167a, which has long since been retired and is a dim memory.  Most of us who remember the 2167a learned valuable lessons that have served us well long after the 2167a was retired and replaced by DOD-498, which in turn has been replaced by commercial standards. The lessons, in the form of an approach to software engineering that eliminates risks, should not be forgotten, making this book a valuable addition to any serious software engineer's library even.  What I like is the many ideas in the standard, which the author has highlighted and succinctly described, which can be refactored into modern processes and procedures.  Also, don't let the waterfall model that was embodied in the 2167a deter you from this book because much of the material can be aligned to spiral or rapid development life cycle models.<br />This book is not for everyone, but is is a gem for those of us who want to search for established best practices from the past and ressurect the best of those practices and give them a face life.  To me this book is practically worth its weight in gold.	2001-12-25
US	43157566	R39RYNFMELTM31	1563270501	217897243	Software Excellence: A Total Quality Management Guide	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Collection of practical best practices	I discovered this wonderful book when I visited a friend last summer and was so impressed that I immediately invested in a copy.  The chapters ranging from quality control methods to processes to testing to software maintenance are comprised of papers written by members of the Japanese Standards Association.  Each paper is clearly written, beautifully illustrated and, most importantly, provide some of the best insights into software quality that I've ever read.  <br />This book can be immediately used to develop an effective quality program that will be based on proven practices and techniques.  The section of software maintenance alone is worth many times the price of this book.  Also, if you are striving for CMM Level 5 this book has all of the ingredients for meeting the process areas associated with optimizing and continuous improvement.<br />If you are an advanced SQA professional or responsible for a large software engineering organization this book is essential reading.  I also recommend it for test and QA professionals and release managers.	2001-12-25

If you are familiar with goal-question-metric planning you will see the elegance and value of this book. Although the author does not use GQM explicitly, the processes and integration of those processes are fully supported within the GQM framework.<br />This book is complete and thorough and goes well beyond commonsense.  As an example, the chapter on release and version numbering gives one of the best approaches I've encountered, and the end-to-end processes are anything but basic.  They are a blueprint for getting to CMM level 3 and about in a number of KPAs, including project management and quality assurance.  This book only appears simple to simple-minded people.  Experienced professionals who understand the difference between theory and the challenges of real life will see this book as one of the most valuable resources they can own.  Additionally, you would have to buy a pile of books, then soft through them to get the same comprehensive approach that the author progives between two covers. If you are a professional who is concerned about process and effective SCM and release management this book is essential.	2001-12-17

Although other reviewers have recommended reading the author's earlier books if you've never written policies and procedures I was able to quickly produce detailed documents that my staff assured me were clear and effective.  I attribute my success to the easy to follow steps that Mr. Page gives, and the logical structure that he recommends.<br />You can't go wrong if you use this book as a guide for policy and procedure writing.  It's like a cookbook in many ways, with a clearly laid out recipe for success and a list of ingredients that will be required in the form of steps and item blocks for your documents.<br />I was so impressed with this book that I immediately ordered a copy for myself (so I could return the borrowed copy), as well as copies of Mr. Page's other books.  If you write policies and procedures for a living, or are required to produce them for your department you should get this book ASAP.  It will simplify the task and enable you to produce professional results regardless of your level of experience.	2001-11-22
US	43157566	R16LM8UCIH5752	1893115585	59941958	Architecting Web Services	Books	5	7	9	N	N	Amazingly useful	This book is one of the most useful references I've come across.  It is environment-independent, provides a concise approach to web services architecture, and is filled with examples.  The examples are augmented by the author's web site, which guarantees that errata, updates and new artifacts are up-to-date and fresh.<br />I like the way the author breaks down a web architecture into a collection of services, which is the way it should be done, and the time and care he lavished on providing examples.  While the examples are somewhat lite, they are more than sufficient to spark a developer's imagination.  For the architect this book gives a complete framework and an array of example services.<br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough.  I was so impressed that I ordered copies for every developer and architect on my team.  This is our first reference, and is often cited in design reviews and code inspections.  If you're involved in web architecture or development this book belongs on your short list.	2001-11-09

The ability of the authors to tell a story, unfortunately, is not. The problem is the authors seem to lack storytelling skills. As a technology professional I admire their writing, which would sparkle if the book were a technical dissertation. However, when I read a novel (a rare thing), I want it to read like a novel and not like a technical document. If the authors take a few seminars on creative writing, learn how to use words to elicit emotions (except for disdain) and to engage the reader, then rewrite this book it would easily rate 5 stars. Like I said, the storyline is wonderful - the telling of it is, well, dry and sterile.	2001-08-28

It's complete, goes right into the details and is clearly written. I cannot think of a higher compliment to pay a book or author. If you're a WAP developer or are ramping up for a WAP development project this book will get you there. I loved the treatment of WML, deploying services and wireless telephony applications.

The CD ROM contains some useful tools, but was missing the testing templates promised on the back cover of the book. Since I work in SQA this oversight makes the book a major disappointment. If you want to quickly immerse yourself in the technology, this is a good place to start. If you are looking for meatier details, this book is not particularly valuable.	2001-08-28

From what I've seen, experienced and endured, this is sorely needed. The book also is not centered on any particular vendor, which is something that I appreciate. On the negative side, the book is extremely lightweight, skimms the surface of some important issues (content management, security and performance testing come to mind.) Recommended for entry level testing professionals (or those who find themselves thrust into a testing role) and web developers who want to expand their professional horizons. NOT recommended for anyone who has been doing structured testing in any environment. This book will state the obvious and waste your time.	2001-08-28

If you are western writer this book may hold some value.	2001-08-28

Had to say that because too many people have complained that the author spent a lot of time on Rational's tools and approach.  Of course - that happens to be fairly obvious from the word &quot;ClearCase&quot; in the title.<br />Good information for planning a ClearCase implementation.  One worthwhile use of this book is to prepare your development and release team for ClearCase.  This will make sure that everyone is familiar with ClearCase functions and how it is supposed to be used in the software engineering environment.  I like the way the book also discusses SCM in general.  <br />If you are planning on implementing ClearCase this book is an inexpensive way to prepare your team.  If you're shopping for an SCM tool this book will give you an unbiased report on Rational's product.  If you want to learn about SCM find another book because this isn't it.  Oh, learn to read too.	2001-07-20

A good example is the failures of one dot com after another during the past year.  At one time the term Prestigious Dot Com evoked envy, not it's an oxymoron.  Why this happened in a large part is because the cowboy mentality, and to be fair, there were a fair share of &quot;cowgirls&quot; who can take blame, that said we don't need no stinkin' processes.  Well, guess they were wrong. What's sad is this book gives a good benchmark set to compare your capabilities and is ignored or badmouthed.  What's sadder is the people who scream the loudest about how terrible the CMM is are the ones who cannot speak intelligently about what it's really about.  If you want to be an exception and succeed in this competitive environment you own it to yourself to check this book out.  Or fail.  Your choice.	2001-07-14

What saves it is at least the architecture is based on contemporary thinking and not the latest pap out of Redmond.  That alone makes it tolerable. Of course the RUP centric view and emphasis on CORBA are strong points.  If you're out to learn architecture (as in go to bootcamp) at least study the solid features of architectures and methodologies.

You'd be surprised at the misconceptions that abound about what the CMM is and how it's supposed to be used.  This book should clear up the misconceptions while explaining what it takes to attain increasing levels of capability maturity.  For those who do not know that the CMM is (hence the widespread misconceptions), it's a measurement of how mature a software development organization is that is based on processes and practices.  It is NOT a methodology and does not compete with them.  I have found that those who have never taken the time to read the literature are those who scream about how bad the CMM is.  This book will clarify that.	2001-07-13

What's nice is the wisdom is tied to life cycle stages so you can relate the team building practices to past experiences at a particular point in a project or the functional area in which you participated.  <br />The second group won't get it because they are the people who are destined to remain second tier professionals.  You can spot them because they are always looking for a silver bullet or waiting for someone to tell them what to do next. This book will go over their heads because the answers that the author provides requires reasoning and thought.<br />If you're in the first group you'll find this book to be a wonderful read and an inspiring text that will motivate you to continually improve. You're either a leader of have definite leadership material.  If you are the type who expects a book to spell it out for you, stick with coding, doing moves/adds/changes or whatever it is you do and buy &quot;101&quot; and &quot;For Dummies&quot; books.  This one will go right over your head.	2001-07-13
