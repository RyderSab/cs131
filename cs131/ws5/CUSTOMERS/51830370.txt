It features all the work of Frank Miller on Spiderman and more. It has these great issues:<br />Spectacular Spider-Man #27 - 28 (Miller's first crack at Spiderman and Daredevil)<BR>Amazing Spider-Man Annuals #14 - 15<BR>Marvel Team Up Annual #4<BR>Marvel Team Up #100<br />Plus it features all the coveres Frank Miller ever did for Spiderman! Frank Miller only drew these issues, except for Team Up Annual #4 (He wrote that one). It features writing from such as Chris Claremont and Denny O'Neil and Bill Mantlo!<br />I don't like the fact that this book is oversized, and thus bigger than other TPBs or Hardcovers, and might be hard to fit on a normal shelf. Still the content of this book turned out to really make up for that!	2002-04-28

I was happy and content with Supes, Bats, Spidey and the X-Men. Still while on vacation my Mom let me get some books - and I was pondering wether to get Sandman. I looked at the first page, wondering and began reading some of it. Before the first page even ended, I felt that I would love this book. And I did! It is literally our Myths taking form!<br />I always thought \\"For Mature Readers\\" meant that it was \\"Adult\\" Stuff that a kid wouldn't be suitable to read. That, off my head, made me think of sex, violence and gore. Thats why I love Mainstream Comics so much, they are safe to read. Still I took the risk, going on a hunch that it would be good. It isn't mainly about any of the stuff I thought a \\"Mature\\" title would have. Though there is some gross and violent stuff that you'd want to keep away from little kids, still this book is just that good! It's safe for anybody who doesn't have the mind or inclination to go stab your eyes out with spikes. Though only violance of that nature is small and not used without reason.<br />Death is my favorite character - cute and cheery! Sandman himself is an impressive character, who we see lost his Kingdom and now has to rebuild.<br />This series was so good, reading, that I went ahead and ordered the rest of the series. Like one of my favorite series \\"Starman\\" Sandman has a begining and end, like any serious novel would have.<br />Interesting fact I heard: A future issue won an award for Fantasy. Some people were mad becuase they thought a comic wasn't serious enough to be considered. This book is mature in it's intelligence and ellagance that it can match any \\"serious\\" novel anyday!	2002-02-24

Very nice volume that covers a lot of Canary's early history. Like the fact her first appearence she was described as being a villian, although she stole from criminals only. Then she bacame a hero fighting, early on, with Johnny Thunder (Who should get his own volume to. Email DC and say you want one!) Canary then went on to do a solo gig in her own feature in Flash comics. This volume even shows her team up with Starman - which now in DC history is when Canary had an afrair with Starman.<BR>So if you want to find out about the early adventures of Diana Drake, the first Black Canary (Diana lance, now appearing in Bird of Prey, is her daughter) then buy this volume!	2002-02-16

JLA, at the time it was made, seemed like a campy version of the modern JSA. Still the issues contained in these books are good and entertaining.<br />This book is written by Gardner Fox, the same man who wrote for the early JSA - so it really is like a historical prespective to compare the two.<br />Warning: If you are buying this book thinking you'll get issues with Batman and Superman - don't count on anything substatial. Batman and Supes usally take a side route in these adventures, not participating, or appearing very little at all. I at first didn't like these issues becuase of the lack of Superman and Batman - but after that inital disapointment the issues become enjoyable.<br />These issues show the first appearences of many villians - like Amazo<br />For those of you afraid this is like the Superfriends, it is and it isn't. It's much smarter than the Superfriends (No Legion of Doom or any dumb ideas like that) but don't expect it to be that smart or intelligent - I emphizise the word: Campy!<BR>Still you don't nessisasrily have to have been born durring 1960 to enjoy these books. They are good and entertaining. (And starting with Volume 3 have regular guest appearences of the JSA)	2002-02-12

The JSA where the first and set the foundation for all Comic Superhero teams that came after it. (The JLA, X-Men, all of them) This book is sooooo good, soooo well written. I just loved it!<br />I use to hate the JSA, but now after reading some of writer Geoff John's issues I was converted and now love the JSA! This book contains the first 5 issues, and first secret files, of the new JSA series. This was the most popular and best reformation of the team.<br />This book features great characters like Star Girl, Hawk Girl, Dr. Fate, Wild Cat, Wonder Woman (Diana's mother), Golden Age Green Lantern and Flash, and also the death of the orginal Sandman and his side kick, now grown up, Sand. (Who becomes leader, and a Sand Like Man, and totally rules!)<br />Even if you aren't a comic fan, this might be a good start. It's a interesting story, with lots of action. Fans will love this!

And you don't need to be to enjoy this book. This book reprints All-Star JSA issues #3 - 6. The book features the VERY first Super Hero Team! The stories are corney, sure, but it's still fun and entertaining to this day. Like one reviewer said, if you get one Archive you'll want to get them all - it's that good! Comic fans will love this book, and it's other volumes.<br />This story features interesting characters, like Spectre, Dr. Fate, Golden Age Flash and Green Lantern, Hour Man, The Atom, Hawkman (also features Hawk girl in one issue) and my favorites Sandman and Jonny Thunder!!! All are classic heros that even appear today, like in Comics such as &quot;Spectre&quot; (Who is Hal Jordon now) and &quot;JSA&quot; written by Awsome Writer Goeff Johns.<br />Buy this book if your a comic fan!

The USA is a freedomless state. Everything in the goverment is classified. Freedom of Speech is illegal. News is done in the nude. Everything is wrong with this country.

The art it's self is good, but the special effects of color and light they throw in are horrible. Still the story makes up for it<br />Characterization of Carrie, the new Catgirl (Former Robin) is great. She takes a prominant role in the story.

The Russian turns out to be a horribly scary and funny character. Get this book and catch up on the latest stories of the Punisher.

Not great. I would think they would want to start the EFC book line with the best story they could get. Still this book had it's good points. It didn't totally rewrite EFC history. The story does  explain how Doors starts to suspect and work against the Talons. Thats the  good point of the book.<br />The bad points. Mainly technical plot errors.  Errors which show that the writer of this book does not exactly watch the  show reguarly. 1. The writer does have the Talons touching humans, taking  and mimicing their DNA. 2. A rocket missile is said to have hit a Talon  shuttle, but the shuttle isn't even scratched. This is contradictory to an  episode in which a shuttle is destroyed by a rocket launcher. 3. This  mistake was a major disapointment to read. The write says a Talon is  scratched, bleeding black blood. Hello!  The Talons are suppose to be pure  energy! They just had an episode about the Talons being worshiped just  becuase of that. There are also numerous refrenses in the show to this  fact. (Like when Zo'or was a jury member in the Ro'ha trial.)<br />I know it's  just a book based on a show, but it's still sooo much more enjoyable when a  book accurately fits in with the show's plots.<br />Bottom line: wait for the  Paper back if you must read this. Don't get me wrong, the book is good in  some points. Just little details like these just ruin the plot sometimes.	2000-01-25

Also it was very nice how the story mixed largely with Viking Mythology. (No vikings, though. Viking never wore  horn; a little fact just for your information.)

This is one of those types of books were you read certin things in the plot and wonder &quot;Was there a huge underlineing  signifigance about this part, that I missed, or what?&quot;<br />Be mindful,  though, that this book did have some very good points. Some surpriseingly  drimatic points. Like Picard's encounter with a mirror image of him self as  Locutus of Borg - or Q's travels in the vally of dispair. (Truely, I could  almost feel the hopelessness.) The characters were very in-character. (Why  another reviewer would think otherwise is a mystery to me. There always  seem to be people who think that, for the strangest and unkown  reasons.)<br />The story, as a whole, is very symbolic - which, based from  past Star Trek episodes, you'd expect. Symbolism can be very confuseing,  sometimes, but some times, also, very enjoyable. I think the &quot;End of  the Universe&quot; plot of this story was very symbolic of our approching  &quot;End of the Century&quot; Which I found as a very enjoyable twist. The  symbolism, though, gets strange at the end, concerning the end of the  universe. (Which we wen't really told how it ended.) But, then again, to  not understand is to truely understand.<br />A good book, but not really worth  the cost of a normal hard cover. (Too small for a hardcover) Wait for the  paper back, which might look a little bigger in terms of size.)	1999-09-12

The planet they visit is very interesting.<br />A very good story. My  only problem with it was that a cure wasn't really found. They got rid of  the infectors, but not the real diseis. Still, it did justic to the rest of  the series. Now... all they need to make the whole series a hit is for the  next two books to be good.	1999-07-14

This was an excellent trilogy, and not  deserveing of the bashing it's reciveing. Granted, the story could have had  less refrences to old trek episodes, but those refrences are not the story.  The story was fabulous and very creative.<br />Q's old rival is a master  stroke for Trek villans, twisting unsespected development and a totally  evil personality.<br />The side story of Lem Fal and son was very good. When  Fal rejected his son, in book 2, I could almost hear the shattering soul of  Milo's heart.<br />The plot might be slow, but it gave depth to it. (When  describeing young Q watching the Bird people fly to their deaths, I could  fell the lonesome apmosphear. I could even see the appeal Q had in  it.)<br />This Trilogy was excellent, putting Greg Cox as my second favorite  Star Trek writer.

My two favorite  stories in general were Nelix and Kes' stories. (They were the most lose  ended characters of the whole show and it was cool to find out how they  meet.)<br />Even though the novel is full of a few mistakes, like how Nelix  says he never told Kes his story, but then in Kes' story he tells her about  himself.

Neelix is back in the bissness of being a guide, even though it was  clearly made known in the show that he dosen't know anything beyond Borg  space. (Who would?) But this could be explained by Voyager tradeing with  other ships for information.<br />Over all was an excelent story. An epic tale  of an assination of a curropt King who let a whole world be taken by the  Borg.

Well executed, and Janeway is excelently protrayed. Just imagin what it would be like for Janeway to lose her ship and be dumped with some backward technological race. It was great, and deserves the best of reviews.	1998-07-24

It was funny, action packed, and fun. The characterization is right on. Some people have critized it becuase of the sex that was stuffed in. Granted that I think it could have done without it, but it was nothing hardcore. Plus the thing with the Alternate Beverly and Picard falling in love flowed into the plot, and provided opertunities to have jokes about.<br />I highly recommend it, but remember that you should at least have seen a large number of TNG stories to fully understand it. (Make sure you know something about &quot;Yesterday's Enterprise&quot;)	1998-07-24

I usally don't like TOS stories, but I did like this one. I liked the fact that it had both Sulu and Kirk's prospectives of their tale that weaves into one story. I thought it was very well executed. And added plus, you get to know Sulu's crew. (Sulu's doctor almost seemed Spock like.) I recommend this story if you want a story with big beasts, space fights, and Tuvok. (He sqirmed his way into this tale ^_^)	1998-07-24

It was my first Voyager book, and it wasn't my last since this book rocked! The story was great, and it even had Kes and Torres speaking together.	1998-07-20

This is leading up to what I think is going to be the best Q-Story ever. The story draws Picard on an adventure, unwillingly taken by Q, to see Q's past and how he became who he is. (You can blame 0 for it!) A very entertaining story, two of it's NON-Q bonus is that it takes place of the Enterprise-E. Also they have the new security officer Lt. Baeta Leyoro. Great story, from reading the first two chapters of part 2, I think it will be getting better and better.	1998-07-17

So I don't have any other books of this kind to base this review on. But that didn't stop me from liking this story. It's plot was compelling, and showed some views of Japanese life that I've never known about. The one down side to the story is that this is, once again, another book that stuck sex into it. I thought it would have been better if that was left out of the story. Yet, the plot reddemed it's self and turned out to be a good story.	1998-07-17
