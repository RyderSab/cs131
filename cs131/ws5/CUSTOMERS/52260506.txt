Reenactments are big throughout the USA, Europe (and even Japan) as well, attracting thousands of spectators.<br />Unusually, the author limits her coverage to only 20th Century reenactments in the USA which limits the scope of reasons for getting into the hobby, I think. I am cross-reading this book with another book \\"Living History\\" (Brassey Pub)which covers other reenactment groups as well.<br />Accoding to the author, these 20th century groups are focused on private events (no public involvement), with unscripted firefights using blanks  being the primary reason for reenactment. The public events with scripted performances and living history presentations  appear to be barely tolerable to most of the reenactors, who have to deal with the ignorant public on their displays. This gives the impression that these reenactors enjoy their hobby only within a tight network of similar minded folks.<br />This would contrast with other period groups who appear to be more focused on the scripted performance, public displays and the historical aspects of reenactment.<br />Given this approach, I doubt that the book or the hobby would appeal to many of the ignorant lay public.	2005-06-03

This coverage based on new and sometimes unfamiliar eye-witnesses' accounts constitutes the good bits about this book.<br />The bad part is the clear anti-Napoleonic bias throughout the book, sometimes well-presented but at other times, made as sweeping statements without basis. It devalues the contents.<br />This book would have benefitted from a strong editorial input.	2005-05-24

Hence, he is trying to write this book from a different perspective, by analysing the reasons for the way the Pacific War unfolded rather than to give a straightforward chronological account.<br />The end result is the same - a chronological account of events as they unfolded.<br />The analysis is partially successful. Willmott has a rather engaging style of writing and claims to write from an objective perspective with hindsight. The problem here is that he selects his own objectivity.<br />An example is the following. Nothing about the WWII Pacific campaign was straightforward, even its beginnings. The WWII European campaign's was - the invasion of Poland. Period. The author grudgingly admits that we may trace its roots politically back to the Versailles Treaty. However for the Pacific campaign, he thinks that it started at the Sino-Japanese war 1937, or better still, it started at the Japanese Manchurian war 1931 or even when Japan first emerged as a modern industrialised power.<br />Furthermore, he would propose a viewpoint and raise a few facts in defending it. The problem is that he sometimes does not state his facts clearly.<br />There are also a few brouhahas as per the following examples:<br />Willmott thinks that the Japanese sense of superiority was due to their \\"mandate from heaven\\". This concept and term is only associated with Chinese dynastic history and is out of context here.<br />He believes that many accounts of WWII focus too much on the little things. One example cited was that he thinks that ULTRA's contribution to the Allied success in the Atlantic campaign has been over exaggerated in far too many books. Thus, he completely fails to mention here that breaking the Japanese code led largely to success at Midway as well as other Allied campaigns. In an about twist, he credits the minor contribution of the Allies in Burma as being important to the whole Pacific campaign. The bombing of Pearl Harbour was insignificant militarily, except in propaganda value and in delaying the American naval build up by a few months. Yet the book devotes two large map spreads on four pages, one for each wave of Japanese aircraft.<br />He spells the town names Selangor as Segolar and the Kokoda Trail is perverted thruout as the Kakoda Trail.<br />Some of the accompanying maps are oversimplified. Some are beautiful. Therein lies the problem - these series of books attempt too much - a structured text with numerous illustrations to appeal to the general public. The problem is that there is a perceived imbalance between text and illustrations.<br />There is no space for thoughtful analysis nor revisionist thinking which might be better served elsewhere.paign.

A Frenchman, his most famous paintings surprisingly are on English history, chiefly his The Execution of Lady Jane Grey, The Princes in the Tower, and Cromwell and Charles I.<br />His few forays into Napoleonic memorabilia resulted in two fine paintings of Napoleon in his Study and Napoleon at Fontainbleu, and the later Napoleon crossing the Alps, an uninteresting painting, even if somewhat historically more accurate than David's earlier heroic depiction of Bonaparte crossing the St Bernard Alps, calmly mounted on an unconvincing charger.<br />The author has made a very informed attempt to flesh out Delaroche's psyche through thematic discoveries in his paintings.<br />One error that I found was that Henri-James Guillaume Clarke was never Marshal under Napoleon, but was Duc de Feltre and Minister of War under Napoleon. He was created Marshal under the Bourbon Restoration.<br />The end result is a very illuminating biography on an unremarkable artist whose style was outmoded. Delaroche was lauded in his lifetime - a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Horace Vernet and possibly Jean L. Gros, he continued on in the tradition of history paintings but without the flair of David. He has been eclipsed by his other more famous contemporaries, Ingres and Delacroix, who are most closely connected with the Romantic movement and he has been largely ignored in this century.	2001-11-01

Only the second part of the review refers to this book but I disagree that this book is recommended only for libraries. I found this book to be quite an intoxicating read as the other reader reviewer has stated.<br />Here, Warren Roberts display a very lucid understanding of the chronological events of the French revolution as it unfolded and has written a key account, linking it specifically to the lives of two artists who were inextricably linked up with the key events.<br />The book is divided into 5 sections. An introduction outlines the situation that France found herself in shortly before the French revolution took place. Then the next section focuses in on the key events of the revolution, linking them up to practically all of the chronological engravings of J Prieur. The true value of this book really is in the 60-odd historical tableaus drawn by Prieur and the marrying of the somewhat confusing chronological events of the French revolution to these tableaus. The author gives a thorough description of each historical tableau within the text, not in the captions, and this is what makes the book so readable. With hindsight, Prieur apparently recorded quite faithfully all the key events iand this contemporary visual evidence is the closest that we have to unbiased visual documentation of the period. The third section gives a very comprehensive essay on Roberspierre and the various factions within the French republic. This is then followed by a section on J.L. David and his accomplishments. Most readers will probably be familiar with David's biography and there are no surprises here. A concluding section brings all the threads together.<br />The two artists selected and contrasted here are J.L. David and J. Prieur, both Jacobin members and the contrasts in their abilities and fortunes could not have been more dramatic. Both artists worked for the revolution and recorded them, David in a painterly academic style which created the classical movement in art whilst Prieur was an unremarkable jobber, whose 60-odd historical engravings are now housed in the present Carnavalet museum, Paris, and has been rescued from relative obscurity by Roberts in this enlightening and entertaining book. While David survived the revolution, Prieur was beheaded shortly after completing his last scene.<br />I came away with a good understanding of the French revolution due to the complete empathy that Roberts gives to the period.<br />The only complaint that I have is that the book is physically quite small and hence, the reproduced engravings are small, too, hence 4 stars.<br />Highly recommended even for the layperson.ked for the revolution and recorded them, David in a painterly academic style which created the classical movement in art whilst Prieur was an unremarkable jobber, whose 60-odd historical engravings are now housed in the present Carnavalet museum, Paris, and has been rescued from relative obscurity by Roberts in this enlightening and entertaining book.

In \\"Galloping at Everything\\", he promises to reinterpret the value of the British Cavalry and explode the myth about their lack of military value. However, this books is marred by numerous inconsistencies and selective referencing.<br />For example, comparisons should be made with other contemporary mounted units, allies or enemies. However, the author states outright that he will not make comparisons with other contemporary mounted units Later, he contradicts himself by making some comparisons with the mounted units of the King's German Legion and the French cavalry.<br />The author reanalyses the findings of earlier historians, notably Oman, Fortescue and Napier to reinterpret the role of the British cavalry. These three historians have apparently been at odds in interpreting the role of the British cavalry in the Peninsular war. Generally, Oman is on one side of the debate, with Fortescue and Napier on the other side.<br />Mr Fletcher especially thinks that Oman has been the main villain in depicting the British Cavalry in a bad light by, misquoting Wellington (who also thinks likewise), highlighting their spectacular failures such as Campo Mayor and Maguilla, overlooking their spectacular successes such as Sahagun and ignoring other numerous tactical successes. Furthermore, by misinterpreting the true nature of some of these actions, Oman has painted the British cavalry as incompetent. The funny thing is that in some of these actions, it is Oman (not Fortescue) who thinks that the British cavalry performed well. Whatever their interpretations, throughout this book, Mr Fletcher picks on the more favourable interpretation of either historian to buttress his argument that the British cavalry was very successful in their tactical role.<br />A blow-by-blow dissection of his inconsistencies would take up far too much space and I have condensed some of the main points below.<br />The Introductory chapters take broad swipes at Oman's dominant interpretation of the British cavalry role and Wellington's dismissal of their military value. In Fletcher's opinion, there were only two overall brilliant commanders of British cavalry - Henry Paget and Gaspard Le Marchant, and Sir Stapleton Cotton was just an adequate commander who merely followed instructions from Wellington. To cite from the book directly \\"Cotton lacked the brilliance of Henry, Lord Paget\\". A few paragraphs down, the author repeats his assertion that the British cavalry was well led, this time however by three very good commanders - Paget, Le Marchant and Cotton. This contradicts the earlier analysis of Cotton's capability.<br />The author apparently equates brilliance with flair and dash. For example, Robert Crafurd, Paget and Le Marchant were all brilliant. However, Crafurd was \\"prone to error of judgement and over enthusiasm\\" and Paget's abilities \\"have been called into question\\".  That's brilliance?<br />Further discussions on the relative merits of cavalry officers appear pointless. The British had a purchase system where they bought their way up the military hierarchy.

The author weaves in the historical perspectives of the nature of these prints and the social role they play in shaping the perceptions of the French nation in the post-Napoleonic era. In that respect, this book has succeeded marvellously.<br />However, the analysis of the prints themselves is problematic. The prints generally deal with the pictorial representation of Napoleon as an iconic figure as well as representations of his military campaigns. To do full justice to these prints then, one should be familiar with the military uniforms and the correct representation of Napoleon's military achievements. The author is obviously unfamiliar with the military aspects of the Napoleonic era as there are numerous errors in interpretation of these prints in this book. Furthermore, she is also unaware of the full panoply of Napoleonic paintings from which many of the artisans of these prints may have drawn their ideas.<br />For example, she has confused the red uniform of the first consul in a painting by Gros with that of the uniform of the Colonel General of the Grenadiers a pied in a print by Georgin. Both uniforms were worn by Napoleon. The author also thinks that the print entitled Napoleon at the Camp of Boulogne was based on the famous painting by David entitled The Distribution of the Eagles. The print is more likely to be based on a painting by Debret entitled Distribution of the Cross of the legion of Honour 1804 with which it shares remarkable similarity. In another print, she has mistaken the green uniform of the Chasseurs a cheval for that of the Grenadiers a pied, another of Napoleon's favourite uniform.<br />In a Georgin print entitled The battle of Essling-Death of the Duke of Mentebello, she doesn't realise that the dying Marshal Lannes is the Duke of Montebello, and she wrongly ascribes this to an Austrian officer in a white uniform!<br /> In a Vernet print entitled Napoleon at the battle of Lutzen, what she has identified as Imperial cavalry looks more like horse artillery. In yet another print by Raffet entitled They Grumbled and Continued to Follow Him, the author states that Napoleon was leading them out of Russia. Napoleon never led his troops out of Russia (he left them to Eugene Beauharnais and rushed back to Paris) and the print is obviously based on themes during the 1813-1814 campaign in France.<br />In a Vernet painting entitled Battle of Wagram, she identifies a page as an officer and she wrongly gives the year of the battle of Austerlitz as 1804 when it should have been 1805.<br />Despite these numerous errors and others, the book is a very entertaining read and I thorough recommend it.this to an Austrian officer in a white uniform!<br /> In a Vernet print entitled Napoleon at the battle of Lutzen, what she has identified as Imperial cavalry looks more like horse artillery.

He has made his task even more difficult by moving away from a Eurocentric view of global warfare. The problem of course is compounded by the fact that this would require a synopsis of warfare covering different geographical settings, different forces and logistics and different cultures. This is not achieved here.<br />I note with interest that this series will in the future cover other non-European warfare and colonial warfare and would prefer to save my money for these more promising offerings.	2001-10-02

JL David was, of course, the Revolutionary artist supremo of his day. His arguably most famous paintings were the Oath of the Horatii, the death of Marat, the unfinished Tennis Court oath and of course the Sacre plus numerous historical paintings. What is most telling is David's role in casting the revolution in a masculine manner.<br />This remarkable book recasts JL David's paintings in a bold new way - he was obseesed with the naked form and really was casting the revolution in a feminine manner, and hence drew and sketched all his figures in the nude, then finishing them as clothed figures. Also, he was acting out his girlish fantasies and some of his figures have an effiminate look to them. Wow!<br />This line of psychoanalysis is all new to me, the fact that one can project thought patterns on a person's mind 200 years ago just by linking up some letters to some sketches and paintings. Necklines of course refers to the low cut on female clothing, especially his Grecian or Roman-clad women and the fact that David himself came very close to losing his head.<br />It had never occurred to the author that sketching nude figs was David's usual modus operandi in drawing, as confirmed by other art historians. And his painting of Julie Recamier? The same person was also drawn by Gerard and it looked as if two different persons were depicted. It's debatable as to whether this was a great painting. The patron rejected it anyhow.<br />I did enjoy the fantasy ride, though.	2001-10-01

It covers the period from the Anglo-Dutch Wars up to the emergence of the steamship era as this period involved rather large naval engagements. What is surprising is the lack of coverage on the Tudor and Elizabethan era (the Spanish armada and the numerous engagements between the Portuguese and the Dutch). Weren't the Portuguese the first preeminent seafaring nation in the age of sail?<br />Some engagments are presented but tactical details are lacking as this is a broad coverage. If so, why bother to explain basic ship handling in the introductory sections as these are tactical matters?  In addition, the text seems to have been written in a hurry and some examples of naval engagements do not tie in with the accompanying maps.<br />This series of books is really quite appealing in general scope and presentation but the contents in each volume vary like crazy.	2001-10-01

I don't read French and fail to understand why the author writes in English and quotes extensively in another language. Then it struck me - he is a learned man, being educated in the humanities in English, French and presumably, Latin as well (says so in his background).<br />Then there is his use of words which do not even occur in any dictionary, thesaurus or great books on organised words that I consulted. I guess that he was making a synedochic point about words and grammar.<br />Finally, his analysis on the one famous painting about the battle of Eylau by JL Gros and that green clad Prussian soldier with the wild look in the corner of the painting. Ah, that I understand except that he got it wrong. That's a Russian soldier being depicted.<br />He'll need to brush up on his military history if he wants a career outside of art criticism.	2001-10-01

This book does what it is suppose to do - that is to introduce the subject on the Art of war to lay readers. I think that he does a decent job of summarising military thoughts and theories from various sources and there are no major surprises in his coverage. I was unclear as to whether the coverage was mainly theoreticians or practitioners of the art. The author states the former. Given the title, I would have thought that it should include the latter also.<br />However, there is a some uneveness in the scope in specific areas. I was surprised that the following examples were not featured: Nathan Forrest 'get there fustest with the mostest' maxim; General Guderian's thoughts on Blitzkrieg; General Rommel's book on infantry tactics; Lawrence's ideas on guerilla warfare; Hap Arnold's on carpet bombing and so on.<br />The text is also not rigorously edited. Poor sentence construction include various subjects leading to ambiguity, numerous conjunctions and phrases which lead to confusion. I had to do constant double-takes to understand the flow of the narrative.<br />The pictures also do not necessarily complement the text and includes poor captions in some instances.	2001-09-24

The author has clearly stated that all of his examples used to illustrate his principles will be that of properly formed armies versus irregular native troops (the Boers are an exception). Thus, the American War of Independence is excluded but surprisingly, several examples from the European Vendee rebellion are also included. The author's style is to state principles, followed by a litany of examples to illustrate his point. He cites many unknown engagements as examples but many of these examples lack firm details. A textual description apparently suffices as examples. The same examples could be used to illustrate other points. I found this approach rather boring and it began to read like a manual to me. On the plus side, there were some examples with more details given, including a sketch map which livened the proceedings somewhat. Douglas Porch provides a neat introduction into the background of Col Callwell, including the fact that he had numerous entries selected for the Encyc. Brittanica. Except for the one on Guerrilla warfare for which the editors selected TE Lawrence. I can see why - Callwell wrote from the perspective of the formed troops - Lawrence wrote from that of the guerrillas.	2001-09-21

It rather focuses on the personalities and events surrounding Austrian dealings with Napoleonic France. Napoleon of course comes out as the dominant personality of the age. However, Count Metternich and Emperor Francis I are also brilliantly sketched in, the latter especially in his dealings with his daughter. Surprisingly, I found this coverage to be the main strength of the book as the writer clearly has an excellent grasp of the flow of events and writes with a clear narrative style.<br />Thankfully, the writer minimises the overly sentimental quotes from Marie-Louise's diaries and also the unnecessary gossips about her amorous affairs.<br />Marie-Louise is really a walk-on character, to pivot the story and to give the book an interesting title. She could not have been better presented.	2001-09-14

Unfortunately, most of the great looking picture books are in French. This book appeared to fill  the niche. However, the quality of the pictures is very disappointing,  many of them tending to have a yellowish cast.	2000-01-12
