Books	5	1	1	N	N	tells it straight	Although this book was published in 1972, much of it remains valid just like Calvin Hernton's \\"Sex and racism\\" in America. Sex is interwoven with American race relations. This is a fact most of both races will deny. The image of a Black Man and a White Woman having sex enrages and unnerves  many White men and Black Women. The opposite does the same for  a large number of White women and Black men. Grace Halsell relates her experiences as a White woman in the south and examines the views of interracial relation in the military, the inner city of Washington D.C. and Hollywood. The most interesting is her interview with James Earl Jones after he perform in the stage and movie version of \\"The Great White Hope\\".	2005-09-16

She is right that the GOP needs to reach out to African-Americans and bring other groups into the GOP. Those who disagree should look at how conservative wedge issues such as the Gay marriage ban fail to pass Congress. Mrs. Whitman calls for consenus building and compromise on many issues. She adds to the debate over the future of the GOP.	2005-08-12

With the exception of legalized interracial marriage, much of what the book says still holds. The recent events of Terrell Owens and Nicollete Sheridan with the towel and Janet Jackson, Justin Timberlake and the bare breast shows that race and sex is still an explosive topic in America. Although interracial couples are more visible, Most Whites and Blacks  still oppose such unions. However, they tolerate them more than they did in 1965. <br /> <br />  This book is very prophetic in that it prdeicted a  future crisis in Black Female and Male relationships. Today, 2 out of 3 marriages in the African-American end in divorce as compared to 1965, when it was 1 out 3. 70% of Black children are born out of wedlock as compared to 20% in 1965. The shortage of Black men for educated Black women has lead many to date and marry White men, but this is not a cure for the race problem in America. Most interracial relationships are brief in duration. <br /> <br />  I recommend this book to anyone who wants a better understanding about race relations in America.	2005-07-08

That view is that Vietnam was a racist and unwinnable war that America should have not gotten involved in. As I read this book, I came across information that is not commonplace. I also learned about the fate of the Vietnamese people who we abandoned to Communism. 21 years later, with the Iraqi war as a backdrop, this book provides very valuable perspectives for policy makers and those who do not want to see the 1975 experience in  South Vietnam repeated.	2005-06-06

Although this book was written in late 1990's, it is very relevant today in the current debates over Gay Marriage, internet pornography, and other social issues. Cal Thomas and Ed Dobson openly say how 20 plus years of political activism by Moral Majority, The Christian Coalition, and other groups have not changed the moral climate of America. In fact, it is still going downward. They also point out that many Christian homes are plaqued with adultery, dovorce, teenage pregnancy, drug abuse and other ills that plaque non-Christian homes. Anyone who reads this book will clearly see that efforts to ban Gay marriage will be met with defeat on the Federal level just like efforts to ban abortion and  legalize school prayer. The authors also show how the Christian Right's virtual marriage to the Republican party has hurt the image of its movement and the Republican Party. <br /> <br />The authors advocate a return to the things that made Christianity grow in previous generations. These are Preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ, doing missionary and charitable work, and living a  Christian lifestyle before the world. This may not be easy for  many Evangelical Christians to accept. However, in view the failures of the Religious right and the continual downward spiral of morality with a born-again President in the White House(George W. Bush), it gives some ideas to think and reflect on.	2005-04-29

Klikner and Smith validate the claim of Black separatist groups such as the Nation of Islam that the Black man is considered a citizen during wartime and tax time. Their analyzing of race relations during The American Revolution, The Civil War, World War II, and The Cold War show that the status of African-Americans was changed by each war. However the nation took 2 steps back when the attitudes of the White majority changed during hard economic times and  developed a reluctance to expand the social revolution that was spurred by the war. The book offers a challenge to all who desire racial and economic equality to continue a unfinished social revolution.	2002-12-03

Many of those who claim to admire Dr. King and quote from his I have a dream speech seem to have never read his books.

In it, Dr. King critiques himself for giving the then youthful leaders of the Black Power Movement too overly optimistic views of the progress of integration. He also presents the pros and cons of Black Power. He states the need for White America to do much more to improve race relations other than declaring racism to be wrong. He calls for the teaching of African-American history, and for the nation to focus more on helping the poor over military spending. This book should be mandatory reading for high school students, college students, teachers, public officials and business leaders.	2002-10-09

It tells how they had to struggle against sexism, disrepect from their male peers and other obstacles. Mary J. Blige is the First Lady of Hip-Hop as shown by the cover of the book. This simply means that she is the preeminent woman in hip-hop. The other bio that the reader will find interesting are those of TLC, Salt-N-Pepa, Queen Latifah, Lauryn Hill, Lil' Kim, Foxy Brown, Eve, Erykah Badu, Missy Elliot, and Trina.

In reading your book, I do believe that god called you for the ministry and left the music industry at the right time. You may have wound up in jail, broke, or dead. The Pharoah that controls the industry will use the threat of lawsuits to keep others from doing what you did. Where I disagree is your insistence there is no such thing as Christian Rap. Some of your brothers in Christ have been doing it for many years, but the music industry which you were once in wanted no part of it. That is the real devil.<BR>The scripture says that the world does not want the true things of god.

He pulls no punches in showing how Africans worldwide are economically dependent on others. He criticizes his fellow Africans in Africa, African immigrants in the u.s., African-Americans, and Caribbean-Americans. He shows the lack of entrepreneurship by Africans can be traced to a deep belief of the inate inferiority of our race and the superiority of other races. He is correct in saying that many Africans have more reverance for the European, the Asian, the Jew and others than for God. One can look at our women and men who dye their hair all colors of the spectrum.   Carlos Cooks  of the African Nationalist Pioneer Movement said that the hair has more sense than this brainwashed person, because it always returns to its natural state.<br />   The book calls for aggressive pursuit of capitalism, taking charge of one's destiny, and seeking out advice in your path to success. It puts out a challenge to Africans, &quot;If you see yourselves as equal to other human beings, you must prepare yourself to play and win the game of capitalism as we do in sports, music dance and the military .This book also makes subtle calls for Black unity that has been call ed for by various leaders such Marcus Garvey, Carlos Cooks, Malcolm X, Kwame Ture (stokely Carmichael) Kwame Nkrumah and others. A united Black world economically independent will be a site to behold.

Many nice guys who have been played and used, as well as some married men and playas like the book. Sistas may find it offensive and proclaim they don't like macks, playas and pimps, but my own 30+ years of observation shows that thugs,playas and macks get the sex with little or no money from various types of Black women across the economic spectrum.
