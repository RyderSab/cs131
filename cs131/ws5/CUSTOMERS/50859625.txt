Water War in Bolivia	Books	2	11	13	N	N	This book should have been called "After the Water War"	About a quarter of this book actually covers the Water War and what lead up to it.  Very basic explanations of what happened and why.  The eight days of chaos at the height of the Water War are left almost without description.  It seems an odd thing to skimp on details of when the time was so critical.<br /><br />Most of the book analyzes the impact for privatization and social movements.  It's more of a scholarly book than an explanation for the average person.<br /><br />The end of the book covers the \\"Gas War\\" (the fight against privitization of Bolivia's oil and gas reserves).	2005-02-08
US	50859625	R1IIGKX1T8BQO7	0450013936	66409775	The Judas Tree	Books	3	4	12	N	N	An average novel	I'm not sure if the previous reviewer and I even read the same book.  This book was average.  Nothing great.  It broadcasts the plot twists dozens of pages before they happen.  The only great thing about this book is that it reminds you how good a similar book(\\"The Heart of the Matter\\" by Graham Greene) is in comparison.<br /><br />The plot involves a old man who decides to right the wrong(leaving his \\"one true love\\") he committed in his youth only to discover it's not that easy.  He can't change a lifetime's worth of taking the easy way out and justifying it to himself.	2004-12-23

Unfortunately the author has a habit of referencing other books (most notably Black Lamb Grey Falcon and Catch-22) far too often, usually just when you've lost youself in the book.  His insight and explanations of what he experienced are great but they often stray back and forth in time.  This sometimes  gets a little hard to follow.  All of these could be cured with just a little editing.  Other than that the only problem I had with the book is that I wanted to know more of his experiences.	2004-12-16

Books	3	3	7	N	N	not for the politically correct	Unless you can get tolerate repeated racist language, don't bother with this book.  It was written in the 60's and it shows.  The N-word is used more times here than in most rap songs and it is used exclusively by the white characters.  It makes it a little rough to read but definitely worthwhile.<br /><br />The liberation referred to in the title is a divorce case that is taken by a white lawyer.  Generally though this book is about a small Tennessee town and its racism.	2004-12-03
US	50859625	RH0EIYZWY1JFQ	0972673903	627602459	Anti-Hero	Books	3	1	2	N	Y	A good book desperately in need of an editor.	The story of this book is certainly worth 5 stars.  However the editing causes me to rate it much lower.  It almost seems as if the author didn't edit it at all.  He repeatedly capitalizes words (every 3-4 pages there is at least one) which loses its effectiveness after a while and just gets irritating.  He repeats his commentary at several points repeating even the exact phrasing he has used previously for his rants on the &quot;war on drugs&quot; and the evils of baby boomers.  And while it seems minor in comparison to other problems in the book there are several grammatical and spelling errors which unfortunately for the author come at critical points.<br />A note to those looking for a more traditional storyline:  This book doesn't have it.  There is no &quot;peak&quot; it's all just stumbling from one adventure into the next.<br />Also I have one problem with the ending of the book.  I won't give it away but I will say it seems like a copout to me.  It seems like he didn't know where to end the book so he slapped a happy ending on and sent it off to the publisher.<br />Overall a good effort and I will certainly pick up anything by this author in the future.  I just hope he gets an editor.	2004-05-16
US	50859625	RSL5XQ53LOWXJ	0141180277	450898563	Three Soldiers (Penguin Classics)	Books	3	7	12	N	N	Not as much about war as the title would have you believe...	This book is not so much about the First World War(most of the book takes place after the armistice) as about the boredom that is inflicted on soldiers to make them a unit.  Even that isn't given in explicit detail, and without this level of detail the rest of the book just falls flat.<br />Also this book has many footnotes which unfortunately are included at the back of the book instead of at the bottom of each page.  It makes for continual flipping back and forth and a most irritating reading experience.	2004-02-16

First off, &quot;The Octopus: A Story of California (Twentieth Century Classics)&quot; edition has several spelling errors and typos.  certainly a book of this quality deserves a better editor than it received.  Also, Frank Norris has a tendency to repeat himself.  Not just occasionally but routinely.  Even using the exact same phrasing within a few pages of the last time it was used.  It certainly could have been slimmed down, probably by about a hundred pages or so.<br />The story is a phenomenal one though and deserves to be read in spite of the sloppy editing.	2004-01-08

Three storylines that are only connected vaguely by the wolves.  While each section is a good solid effort it lacks a solid cohesion.  The tentative connection of the wolves hardly requires it be written as a novel.  Instead this book may have been best written as smaller novellas.<br />At one point it even goes into the telling of Jesus prior to his crucifixion as a comparison to the Russian &quot;holy fool&quot; who later suffers an equally gruelling fate.  This seems both boring and excessive.  It's been done before and better.<br />In short the writing style is compelling but not enough to hold the novel together for 310 pages.	2003-11-29

The author has a bias against wal-mart and he never bothers to conceal it.  He even refers to Wal-Mart as \\"Bentonvillians\\" and \\"blankety-blanks\\". This gives you an idea what to expect throughout.  At least you know what you're in for.<br />Unfortunately it appears most of the information comes from disgruntled former employees and other people who have an axe to grind.  While the anecdotes are amusing and informative most of them appear to be isolated incidents.  He never gives specific insider information that this was all part of some grand plan.  It just looks like a bumbling bureacracy with some medium level tyrants.<br />The most insightful information given is the information about the moving around of management level employees so they don't get settled in and the fact that Wal-Mart fights (and appeals) every lawsuit.<br />I hate Wal-Mart as much as the next fella but I'd prefer to have a few less amusing anecdotes and a few more smoking guns of intentional wrongdoing.	2003-07-28

Including some great details.  The only part about the pictures that is unusual is that occasionally a picture of a Morroccan is thrown in amongst all the pictures of architecture.<br />Unfortunately the text isn't of as high a quality.  You'll also notice that the type is slightly larger than normal perhaps as a way to fill space.  Much of the text is background history which is rather basic, while this is good for the beginner I was hoping for a little more detailed information.	2003-07-04

My problem with the book is that it starts out with very little to cause the author to jump into the feminist ranting.  Some of the feminist ranting is even worthwhile but with very little to get you to that point, it seems excessive.  And the feminist talk definitely goes overboard at a few points.<br />So what did I like about this book?  Well I loved the idea.  A daughter suddenly taking to the street with a sign and a mother with no idea why.  Instead of explaining from the beginning it was an entire book of speculation on the wreckage that the mother's life became in the wake of her daughter's actions.<br />The conclusion (don't worry I won't give it away) simply removes any significance the feminist tract could have had.  So in the end it's all for naught.	2003-06-09

First of all the physical description of the book.  It's slightly too large for a pocket type guide.  The pages are glossy with excellent photos.<br />Considering the collection that this work covers however it is way too thin.  The selected approximately 200 &quot;important&quot; pieces.  I'm not sure how they determined the importance of these pieces as there was no discernable pattern. It was broken up into the age the pieces were from (with a fair smattering from each period) but that appears to be the only categorization.  For each piece there is a brief description ranging from a line next to the picture to a page long.<br />Sadly this gives no indication of Mr. Getty's personal tastes and which items he preferred.  Otherwise a great book.	2003-04-19

It explains the meanings of some of the words used.  For instance mysteries actually relates to Gods.  It also explains that this book is based on a true story.<br />Now on to the review: I personally loved this book. It's a total immersion into the world of the Voodoun priest and priestess and those cane cutters around them during the time of &quot;Papa Doc&quot; Duvalier.  The story draws you inexorably in even as the characters are drawn inexorably closer to ther ends.  Please note that if you are offended by a reference to incest and polygamy you may wish to avoid this book.  It has a couple of references to each.  My only complaint is that I wish the book were longer.	2003-01-27

When a novel starts out with a young boy masturbating and his thoughts during(not what you'd imagine) and after, you know something big is coming.  Whether it's going to be shocking or if it's going to be something else is hard to tell.  But the author's got your attention.  And he keeps it for the most part.  The novel encompasses the life of Wiley Silenowicz.  And it's almost like experiencing every thought, feeling, and sense that he has.	2002-12-16

I started this book with the hopes that she might get some real insight into what it's like to be a wage slave.  To have to worry about how much money is coming, to never be able to take a day off, to have to work through whatever ailments you have.  Unfortunately this book comes across more as a higher middle class woman &quot;slumming it.&quot;  From the very beginning she is realizes that she is set apart because she has her real life to fall back on.  She doesn't deal with being forced to share an apartment because she can't afford one alone.  She always has a car and she never goes without eating because she is cannot afford to.  She always has a &quot;real life&quot; to fall back on.  So each expedition into lower class wage slave is more like a sadomasochistic vacation.<br />At one point she even mentions that she isn't willing to go to California because the Hispanics had &quot;hogged all the low paying jobs&quot;.  As if these people wanted so much to work multiple jobs.<br />All of this is not to say she doesn't gain some valuable insight into the working world.  She came to understand that despite how lowly a job may be that people tend to take pride in their work, and how despite their income how they try to make it easier for one another.<br />Unfortunately because the book is so short you rarely get a feel for the people she meets.  You have to take her word for what they are like.  This makes the whole book feel rushed.<br />At the end she has a chapter summing up her experiences.  While it is a well thought out piece of writing it lacks any feeling for the desperation which the people she was trying to emulate feel every day.	2002-10-16

Everything from K's quirky habits (signing the quotes on the men's room walls and talking to herself) to her pattern of working, going to the bar and returning home is well detailed.<br />This makes it all the more confusing when she starts writing tales which become true. You're never sure though if it's because she's seen the future or if she is causing these events to occur.  What's better is when the characters in her stories start interacting and responding to her.<br />While I won't give away the last portion of the book, I will say the only reason I didn't rate this book a 5 was a few spelling errors and editorial issues.	2002-05-29

The situation and characters are real and lifelike.<br />The author thoroughly demonstrates his knowledge of military thinking.  Unfortunately at times he overstates the obvious in military tactics.  Some passages which should be a few paragraphs take pages and vice versa.<br />The author contrasts the conflict between people of different ethnicities by showing us the conflict between Dixon and Reider.	2000-10-03

The opening  scene is rather graphic and almost leads you into believing this is a pulp  novel.<br />After the opening scene the book is indeed wonderful.  The  characters are well written and well thought out.  Each persons motivtions  and movements are as mysterious as the next.  Just like in real life you  only get a slice of what they are thinking without the whole  motivation.<br />Unfortunately the only other down side to this is the ending.  The ending seems rushed and the murderer' identity and words make little  sense(not that it necessarily should given the horrific nature of the  crimes).<br />Overall well worth the read!	2000-09-04

A novel about the secrets that lie between even the closest of friends. The unspoken and presumed to be well known &quot;facts&quot; keep the characters from knowing as much about one  another as they think they do.<br />The characters are well portrayed with  different motives and desires.  This book isn't always about who did the  crime so much as why.<br />In the end this novel becomes a bittersweet  indictment of near fame and the havoc it reeks.	2000-03-21

This book is mostly about the interior thoughts resulting from exterior forces(the war, relatives back home, other soldiers).
