TREASON AND TRIUMPH delivers a realistic, compelling, and often disturbing view of World War II.  Author Bonnie Toews uses her razor-sharp insights to graphically depict the physical horrors of war.  With brutal honesty, she explores the emotional and spiritual impact on every human being touched by war, exhibiting raw emotion, gentle compassion, and infinite wisdom, such as:  \\"Everything we do, everyone we meet becomes a part of us . . .  Almost like scattered parts of our soul coming home to roost.  For a moment, everything fits, and we belong . . . to that moment . . . or to that person.\\"  TREASON AND TRIUMPH should be required reading in every high school, college, and university.	2002-12-11

Different tastes, I suppose.  I was fascinated by the depth of character and the resilience of Jane.  And inspired by the sadness and misery in her life becoming happiness and joy.  It's a wonderful story of hope and belief in change and things getting better.  It offers brighter tomorrows and better todays.  I loved that.	2002-11-16

I've followed her book by book, and never been disappointed.  Thought-provoking and more indepth than many romances, her work has always been rich and full.  Her venture into TRINITY is a different kind of work for this writer, but every bit as provoking and rich and of the caliber I've come to expect out of a top-notch novelist.  TRINITY is a book of hope.  Maybe I appreciate it a little more than I would have before 9/11 because collectively we need a lot more healing now than we did then.  But then or now, I appreciate the value and worth of healing and hope to readers.  Thank you, Ms. Parr--and please, write more--fast!	2002-11-15

Her relationships outside of that with Mike only add a lush patina to a story already rich and brimming with all the complexities of family life and intricate challenges so many &quot;everyday&quot; people face.

From the first page, I totally identified with the heroine.  (She has a physical reason for her lack of grace; I'm just &quot;blessed&quot; with it.)

This book ranked lower on my &quot;likability&quot; scale because of the subject matter.

I wanted to see what riled him/her up so badly, so I bought the book.  Okay, so I bought it for the wrong reason, but I'm keeping it for the right one.  There are a LOT of good ideas in this book!  In fairness, and to keep this public ledger straight, putting a reorder postcard in a book on a shelf shouldn't have anyone tossing around words like &quot;illegal.&quot;  That could damage a person's reputation.  As for Ms. Tedder's religious beliefs, I believe those are also legally protected.  Bottom line:  someone was having a bad-hair day.  It's a good book, reasonably priced, with some very smart and practical--and affordable--ideas.	2001-05-12

She just keeps getting better and better, and TOO WICKED TO LOVE is a prime example of why.  Her characters are real, complex people who are confronted with  challenges and aren't sure which way to turn--just like the rest of us.  They take the high road.  It's often tougher, but it's right.  I think  that's what I like most about her books.  She writes about people you feel  comfortable admiring.  People you want things to work out for and to see  win.  This is one of her best.  A really good read.	1999-03-07

I loved everything about this book!  It remained true to its historical setting, the social mores and customs, and the mind-set of the society portrayed.

Rarely, if ever, have I read a debut novel (or one by an old hand) that has kept my heart in my throat and me on the edge of my chair from start to finish.  Phillips' book did.  He has a compelling style, a gritty insight into human nature--even the sides of it we want to recoil from--and explores them without flinching.  (Kudos to him on that!)
