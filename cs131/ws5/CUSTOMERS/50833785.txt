Fannie is visiting her grandparents when she discovers a hatbox containing a grey striped shirt. Her curiosity about the  shirt causes Fannie to ask her grandparents about their past. The book  gradually unfolds the events of the holocaust as Fannie continues to ask  questions. She learns of the ghettos, concentration camps, extermination of  the Jews (including 1.5 million children), tattoos, forced labor,  starvation, and beatings. Fannie learns that she will one day inherit the  shirt. She promises to tell the stories to her own grandchildren so that  the world will never forget the holocaust. <br />I highly recommend this book  because:<br />1. The book accurately portrays the stark realities of the  holocaust but in measured amounts so that it is not overwhelming to young  audiences.   <br />2. This is the only book on the subject that I have found  which fills the gap between picture books and full-length chapter books.                                <br />3. The story format is welcoming and  captivating for young audiences who need more than &quot;just the facts  ma'am&quot;.<br />   I read this to my three children ages, 5,8 and 11. They  had no difficulty understanding that the experiences presented in the book  actually happened to real people during WWII.	2000-04-04
