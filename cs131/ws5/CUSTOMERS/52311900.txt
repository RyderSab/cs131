However, it may be just a little too short and condensed. There are better books like this out there like Samples' \\"Without a Doubt: Answering the 20 Toughest Faith Questions\\" , Strobel's \\"The Case for Faith\\" and \\"The Case for a Creator,\\" etc.<br /><br />I do take issue with Rhodes discussion on evil & pain. In an otherwise great discussion, he equates all of pain & death with evil, being evil or being nonexistent before evil entered the world. This is problematic in a number of ways (I quote the following from Dean's book \\"Is the Truth Out There?\\"):<br /><br />Even plants \\"suffer\\" and experience \\"death,\\"...Did these plants suddenly appear after Adam's sin? According to the fossil record they did not. Science has also shown us that animal death is necessary for stable ecosystems. \\"No death before Adam\\" also violates the laws of physics. There is no life, or no work, without decay and death. In any given moment, cells are dying and food is decaying in our bodies so life may continue. Is this death and decay evil? If death was inherently evil, what of God who killed animals to clothe Adam and Eve and the deaths he caused throughout the Bible (in punishing people)? If death is inherently evil, then so is God.<br /><br />Would not a caring creator prepare the world in the best possible way for man, the crown of creation? There are billions of tons of oil, coal, limestone, marble, topsoil and kerogen on Earth. All are valuable, and some necessary, for the maintaining and improvement of human life and all were created by decaying life. Would not the creator - knowing that man would sin by virtue of the fact the creator is outside of time and could see man's future - prepare the world accordingly? Was not the preparation of these materials good?<br /><br /> There is also the illogical claim that God did not create the laws of physics until after man sinned. Why would God create the laws after he created the universe? Those who believe death before Adam is evil explain the existence of carnivores by claiming that creation was already prepared to become meat-eaters since God knew what was coming. If this were true, the fossil record must be a deception, because it shows animals were already eating meat. Adam and Eve were not eating meat (which Genesis 1:29 and Genesis 9:3 seem to indicate) because it is healthier for people with their long life spans. With all the vegetation in Eden, meat would be unnecessary. When mankind's lifespan later decreased, he could eat reasonable amounts of meat without much worry (assuming meat is not the only food you eat, its good properties will outweigh the bad in our relatively short life spans).<br /><br /> When God gave man meat (Genesis 9:3) he did not say anything about changing the animals' diet. One could infer from this omission that the former guideline for animals (Genesis 1:30) was applicable only in Eden or was not completely forbidding carnivorous activity among animals. If Genesis 1:30 were forbidding all carnivorous activity, why does it only refer to the life types man would be interacting with inside Eden (land and airborne animals, see also Genesis 2:20) and not ocean dwelling creatures? To get really technical, read Genesis 1:29-30 again and notice how it is not forbidding anything, but seems to be a recommended guideline. Also, since God specifically told man he could eat meat in Genesis 9:3, here is another obvious point that the death of animals is not inherently evil.<br /><br /> Now consider how Genesis states Eve's childbearing pain was increased after the fall. This tells us two things: 1. There was pain before the fall; and 2. She may have had children before the fall. Also realize that pain is a defense mechanism, so it can not be a construct of evil.<br /><br /> People often ask why some people are taken from this world when they are. Granted, we do not have the larger perspective to see how everyone's life fits together, but consider that God may take people so they do not have to experience our corrupt and evil world anymore. On the other side of things, God limited the life spans of man so he could cause less death and destruction to each other. In other words, death serves larger purposes from a perspective beyond our own.<br /><br /> Once we strip away the emotion of death and look some of the realities of death, we find that the death tautology loses its strength. Not only through physical reality, but it does so through a careful reading of scripture as well.er perspective to see how everyone's life fits together, but consider that God may take people so they do not have to experience our corrupt and evil world anymore.

Old-age = evolution &amp; 2. Genesis indicates 24 hr days.<br />Both assumptions are unequivically untrue.<br />The 13 billion year old universe is not long enough for evolution to work. In fact, the old age is a pointer to design. We could NOT exist in a world younger or older: We exist at the percise age at which is necessary for life to exist.<br />Genesis does NOT explicitly say 24 hour days. Many YECs will even admit that the Hebrew for day can be literally translated more than one way. More importantly, it does not specifically say 24 hour days, so one HAS to look at contextual issues. All such issues point to an old-earth interpretation, none to young-earth.<br />While young-earthers have chosen a path of emotionalism and unchristian attacks, Hugh Ross has once again provided a rational, well-researched defense of old-earthism, which is at the core of the modern intellient design movement. Young-earthism is a stumbling block to nonbelievers (and believers) and is a prime target for skeptics. Let's rid this example of the lack of critical thought from Christianity.	2004-06-22

A couple answers could have been more detailed, but most are adequete.<br /><br />The only problem I have is with question 35 on \\"how old will we be in heaven?\\" While most of the ansewer is helpful, the claim that Adam & Eve had apparent age is inaccurate and problematic. Here's why:<br /><br />The fact is that anything that appears to be old or has the appearance of age is, by definition, not really old. It only appears to be that way. Again, by definition, any such thing made to appear to be something that it is not, is to in fact be deceived by the person or being making it appear that way. Following this logic to its end would lead us to the conclusion that God is deceitful if he were in fact making things that appeared to be something other than what they are in actuality.<br /><br />We cannot know the mind of God, but we know plenty concerning the nature of his character. Never is he irrational, untruthful or deceitful as made clear in verses such as Isaiah 45:19: \\"I have not spoken in secret, from somewhere in a land of darkness...\\"<br /><br />Appearance of age is also tantamount to relative thinking. If something only appears to be old, how can we know anything of the past? One could then say we were created yesterday with memories and physical aging. In other words, appearance of age leads to some ridiculous lines of thought.<br /><br />Appearance of age proponents may claim Adam appeared to be old since he was created as an adult instead of an infant. This reasoning does not pay close attention to the method of Adam's creation. Your age is calculated from the time you were born (we generally neglect the nine months in the womb for simplicity's sake). A year after Adam was created, he had only aged a year. By normal reckoning, he was only a year old. Adam was created as an adult so he was mature in the sense that he was not a child, not in the sense that he had already aged twenty years because he had not been alive that long. It would be as if you were born as a fully gown adult. Had this happened, would you show signs of aging at birth? Would you already have wrinkles, clogged arteries and worn joints? No, being created as an adult means just that: Adam was an adult from the get go and did not start aging until the next moment. Adam did not appear to be an adult, he was an adult. He only appears to be old from our perspective of being accustomed to people growing from an infant. From his perspective, Adam had just started aging!t he had already aged twenty years because he had not been alive that long. It would be as if you were born as a fully gown adult.

I don't think  Adovasio is any more critical of his critics than they are of him. He gives excellent review of carbon dating, the Ice Ages, genetic dating and so on. He discusses how a belief in a biblical \\"global flood\\" shaped geology in the early years. He should have detailed more how people turned to a local flood interpretation as Earth's antiquity became apparent, in order to combat the young-earthers who have spent the past fifty years trying to revive the global flood theory (see Hugh Ross' \\"The Genesis Question\\" for a detailed discussion on the flood and why a literal translation of the Bible requires an old Earth).<br />Adovasio does blindly accept too much of Darwinian evolution. For example, he claims it is \\"clear\\" (p. 85) that we and the apes share a common ancestor. This is untrue, as shown by genetics, and Adovasio leaves this out when he discusses genetic dating techniques. These techniques, and other discoveries, have shown we aren't related to Neanderthals, yet Adovasio claims (p. 86-87) that \\"no one can yet say for certain\\" if they were related or interbred with humans.<br />In any case the book is a fascinating look at American prehistory. It seems America was settled by different groups at different times much longer ago than originally thought.	2004-02-17

He focuses on pivotal people such as Michael Denton, Phillip Johnson, Michael Behe and William Dembski and some of their ground-breaking books such as Denton's \\"Evolution: A theory in Crisis\\" and Johnson's \\"Darwin on Trial.\\"<br /><br />The book focuses mainly on these individuals' methodology and development of arguments, the establishing of the movement and the reactions of evolutionists. The actual science of either theory is only cursorily reviewed.<br /><br />From the beginning, ID has tried to distance itself from other forms of creationism in order to avoid the historic \\"science vs. religion\\" stigma. In particular it has tried to stay away from young-earthism (also known as scientific creationism or creation science). Even though many if not most of the ID theorists accept the validity of an ancient Earth (\\"...the fact [is] that the vast majority of design advocates are open to a universe that is billions of years old. [27]\\" ), they still haven't addressed the young-earth theory head on. Under a \\"big tent\\" policy, they let all design theorists in. But this is introducing the difficulties they were trying to avoid.<br /><br />Consider the following statements about ID and from ID supporters:<br /><br />\\"Another mark [of ID] is the avoidance of ...any details that come from a literal reading of Genesis. [27]\\"<br />\\"The modern phenomenon known as `scientific creationism' did not even exist in 1959. It was not until 1962 that theologian John Whitcomb and hydraulic engineer Henry Morris gave birth to that movement when they published their \\"Genesis Flood.\\" [35]\\"<br />\\"...regarding the age of the earth...I have no desire to quarrel with the generally accepted estimate of four or five billion years...nor do I assume that the literalists are reading the Bible correctly... [81]\\"<br />\\"I assume that creation-scientists are biased by their precommitment to Biblical fundamentalism...I want to investigate whether Darwinism is based upon a fair assessment of the scientific evidence, or whether or not it is another kind of fundamentalism. [93]\\"<br /><br />With such statements which are apparently very strongly against young-earthism, why are skeptics still successful at painting ID as \\"disguised creationism\\" or keeping discussions of ID out of schools?<br /><br />One, notice that ID often refers to young-earthers and their \\"literal\\" interpretation of the Bible. The problem here is that their interpretation is not literal. If it were literal, then resulting contradictions and problems would render the Bible wrong. Skeptics see this and are essentially saying, \\"These ID people believe in God, yet Genesis is wrong, so ID must be fundamentally wrong as well.\\"<br /><br />So no matter how much ID supporters say ID only generically points to a designer, skeptics will see what they believe is faulty Christianity (i.e. young-earthism) as a basis as ID (since most ID theorists are Christians). So as long as ID says \\"young-earth is wrong\\" and does not detail why it is wrong and not literal Biblical interpretation, they will be unable to obtain the level of scholarly acceptance they are seeking.<br /><br />This young-earth problem enhances the ID fallacy that science, \\"...is ill-equipped to identify God as the creator. [27]\\" ID spends so much time promoting solid scientific method and showing naturalism is not scientific at all, yet they themselves stop short. They are deciding a priori that science cannot give specifics about who or what this designer is, only that there is a designer. This is a result of trying to avoid being labeled as creationists or as trying to teach religion in schools. But they artificially telling science what it may conclude, just as the young-earthers and naturalists are doing. If science leads to God of the Bible, then it does so.<br /><br />One way to show that ID's designer is God ofthe Bible, one must show that the Bible and science agree and that the literal translation supports what real science as found. The fact is that Genesis and science do agree. In fact, people like Hugh Ross have detailed this in books such as \\"The Genesis Question\\" with the same quality of scholarship as other ID books - in effect he has solved the problems of ID discussed here, but they have thus far refused to use the solution. (I also noticed that no reference of Hugh Ross is made in Woodard's book, even though he has been cataloging design evidences for years - consider that Denton and Dembski refer/defer to him on these subjects in some of their books - and he was a featured scholar in the book \\"Mere Creation\\" which Woodard writes about, not mentioning Ross and some other participants.)<br /><br /> ID has grown much in recent years, yet many still know little about it. Many oppose it because they see it - however wrongly - related to flawed young-earthism. Removing this creationist stigma fully and totally will allow ID to prosper and supplant flawed Darwinism as the primary and most reasonable theory on origins.translation supports what real science as found.

He vaguely admits to the same problem with his own, yet doesn't seem to think it's as important. He seems to be honestly concerned with creating a naturalistic model and is not concerned with theological implications and is not trying to make them. He does refer to himself as a \\"religious person\\" but does not elaborate (p. 198-199).<br />Gott also seems to blindly accept the evolution paradigm and seems hopeful life will be found in the universe.

I think Gott's book was better than Hawking's in that it does less of this and is probably a better over all reference. If you can separate the science from speculation in both books, they can be useful in understanding some of the latest concepts and already established science.<br />Better books are Greene's &quot;The Elegant Universe&quot; and Hugh Ross' &quot;Beyond the Cosmos&quot; and &quot;Creator and the Cosmos.&quot;	2002-12-03

This book is lavishly illustrated as well, but be wary of oversimplification.<br />Ultimately, the book seems centered on publicizing Hawking's origins theory which essentially allows the universe to create itself.  This theory does have the same problems as most eternal universe theories, such as why was there a self-creating universe rather than none?  His claim that \\"multiple histories\\" theory is a \\"scientific fact\\" seems a bit presumptuous. He uses it as a main component of his theory and the supposed \\"scientific fact\\" is nothing more than speculation. It is only with this speculation that he is able to state that the universe's initial characteristics need not be chosen with care. He seems to ignore factual evidence for the precision of the universe's creation in order to come up with a completely naturalistic explanation, regardless if it is based in reality. Yet he hints at complexity in the universe and admits intelligent life has to be rare (p. 171).<br />While adhering to naturalistic evolution, he admits we don't know how such evolution occurred (p. 161). It seems a lot of astronomers (at least popularizers like Hawking) accept the evolution paradigm as is with out every studying it extensively. He even uses Dawkin's infamous computer-generated speciation model. One would think that Hawking would realize the problem with this. It is an intelligently designed model that relies little on chance, much on designed parameters and vastly oversimplifies biologically processes.<br />His comments about God are the same vague and ambiguous comments he as made previously. He seems to define God has being bound by our universe, yet uses an angel as an example as a being outside of time with the ability to see along the time-line. Elsewhere I have seen him admit his theories are only that: A theory that doesn't necessarily exclude God. It seems he is either: 1. Unsure about God and/or his nature, 2. Doesn't want to publicly take a position, or 3. Wants desperately to create a naturalistic Theory of Everything because of 1. or 2., or in spite of them.<br />Hawking admits that there \\"is no more experimental evidence\\" for some of his theories than there is for astrology. The uncareful reader may not differentiate between the real science and speculation in this book. It seems he wants to go beyond a Theory of Everything that simply reconciles various parts of science, instead he wants to explain the universe's existence and boil everything in it down to a naturalistic theory.  The result is unscientific speculation that ignores the evidence for intelligent design.<br />Better books are Greene's &quot;The Elegant Universe&quot; and Hugh Ross' &quot;Beyond the Cosmos&quot; and &quot;Creator and the Cosmos.&quot;being outside of time with the ability to see along the time-line.

But once I looked at more critically, it doesn't seem as if this was &quot;Noah's Flood.&quot; Sorry, anti-Bible folks, but this flood seems far too recent, and too small in scope on its effect on humans, to be Noah's flood and to account for the proliferation of accounts of a devastating flood.<br />The flood accounts around the world refer to something far more devestating than a flood that effected only a relatively small population. People had moved out amongst the world far before the flood in this book occured.<br />Nor was the flood &quot;global&quot; as some creationists claim. For a good look at the most literal way to read and study the flood account, see &quot;The Genesis Question&quot; by Hugh Ross.	2002-10-31

For a more detailed look at this subject, take a look at the books by A.F. Aveni.<br />The authors do seem to be supporters of the pseudoscience astrology, although they never make a case for it in this book.<br />Astrology is supposedly based on the movements of the heavens, but I have never met an astrologer who even begun to understand Kepler's laws or Einstien's relativity equations, all which describe the movements of the heavens.<br />Two technical errors in the book: They say (p72) that Pluto is bigger than Mercury. No, Mercury is over twice the size of Pluto.<br />P. 43 says there were 3 kings in the Christmas story - a common misconception. Technically, it doesn't say how many, which is why some traditions hold many more.<br />A note on p 105: They mention the &quot;unknown God&quot; that Paul refers to in Acts. They are apparently unware of the historical records which suggest this monument to the unknown god was dedicated to the God of Christianity years before Paul arrived after this God performed miracles for people in the area.

The author claims this theory was a competing worldview on \\"somewhat equal ground\\" to Christianity.  He goes on to say one [science] is based on \\"testing and questioning\\" while the other [Christianity] is based on \\"blind faith.\\"<br />It is obvious, the author, Arthur Upgreen, has never studied the science versus religion debate closely.  If he had, he would have never made such claims right after quoting the<br />works of Christians like Kepler, Galileo and Copernicus.  Nor does he detail the errors  that led to the geocentrisim interpretation/theory to begin with.  Nor the fact that<br />Christianity has never been based upon \\"blind faith.\\"<br />If geocentrisim and the Galileo  Affair of centuries past continue to be such authors' best evidences for their belief, then they don't have much ground to stand on.  Compare these and what few other \\"antiscience\\" events one finds in orthodox, rational Christianity to its pro-science history and scholars,<br /> one finds the former doesn't even show up on the charts.<br />Why write all this all on one paragraph?

The young-earthers want you to believe that their interpretation of Genesis and the flood are the literal and only way.  This is true only if you read the Bible superficially and ignore many contextual and common sense problems with their theories.  Nor has the &quot;global&quot; flood theory been the primary view.  Before people stopped studying the bible with their mind, and started reading it clouded with emotion, the Local Flood was widely accepted, and here's why:<br />1. Gen. 7:11-12 and Gen. 8 clearly show where the water came from (earthly sources) and where it returned (into Earth). The water content on Earth today, even considering water vapor loss to space, is no where near the amount needed for a global flood.<br />2. In Gen. 7:19-20 we see that all &quot;the high mountains...were covered.&quot; The Hebrew for &quot;high mountains&quot; can be literally translated as hills or hill country. The words for &quot;covered&quot; can be translated as falling upon, running over or residing upon.<br />3. The flood account also refers to &quot;the earth.&quot; This can also be literally translated to refer to regions. Humanity was limited to Mesopotamia, so a local flood would still be &quot;universal.&quot; Other examples of this usage are found in Gen. 41:56 and 1 Kings 10:24.<br />4. The ark didn't land on Mt. Ararat as most think (see Gen. 8:4).<br />5. A comparison of the pre-flood Genesis chapters to the post-flood chapters, do not show the massive geological changes that a global flood would have caused (i.e. the landscape hasn't changed at all. Noah didn't seem lost).<br />6. Materials created from dead organisms (oil, coal, limestone, kerogen, marble, topsoil) are far greater in quantity than a global flood could produce (global proponents claim the flood created these items in order to avoid the accepted view that they took millions of years to form. But by no stretch of the imagination was there enough life on Earth, dead or alive, at Noah's time to create all of those materials). Petroleum products were available before the flood (Gen. 6:14).<br />7. Evidence for a major flood can be found in the Middle East, but no consistent evidences for a global flood.<br />8. The Hebrew is particular in the limited types of animals that were brought on the ark.<br />9. All the species in the world couldn't have come from those on the ark without invoking rapid, macroevolution.<br />10. How does a raging, global flood produce distinct layers? These distinct layers show signs of being made by different methods (big floods, slow deposits, oceans, etc.). We don't find all life-forms mixed together as a global flood requires. No where do we find human remains with dinosaurs and other long-dead creatures.<br />11. YECs use limited examples of &quot;trees in coal beds,&quot; etc., as absolute proof of a global flood. If such a flood was global, we would have clear, consistent and a great deal of such evidence. Not spotty, localized evidences.<br />Ross doesn't get into this until his book &quot;The Genesis Question.&quot; While young-earthers resort to emotionalism, hand-waving, and superficial bible reading, Ross calmly and scholarly presents his view for discussion and debate.ions of years to form.

It's sad that our vaunted public education system skips such studies. Yes, being first published in 1960, the book is dated in places, both in style and content. I've never seen anyone depict the despot Nero in such a positive light.  The author occasionally reinterprets certain parts of history and replaces certain facts with his own opinion or speculation. He doesn't always have a good grasp of biblical history and sometimes he does. He'll off-hand say things like Noah wasn't real and moves on. One assumes its just something he heard and thinks it correct. When you read books like this closely, you'll start to find a lot of \\"maybes,\\" \\"probablies\\" and other opinions. Sometimes the author's bias colors these things, sometimes not. For example, he can't seem to get it straight if and which religions helped or hindered science. He kind of stumbles into the answers unwittingly at times. Like when he alludes to the Muslim world building its success on top of those it conquered (before turning their backs on science), but never quite making the point entirely clear (see [[ASIN:0061472816 The Lost History of Christianity: The Thousand-Year Golden Age of the Church in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia--and How It Died]]). At one point he admits that Christians used their beliefs to futher science, and Muslims used it to stop it, but then he makes the blanket statement that religion and science are not compatible. Well, apparently some are and pretenting they aren't after you write that some are is quite silly.  Nevertheless, this is a good companion to a lot of the alternate histories and studies of the ancient world that are in vogue. Not that those \\"alternate\\" folks never stumble upon something valid, for people like de Camp are, at times, locked in their bubble.

The author is surprised that proofs for God have lasted so long, and claims than new discoveries concerning the laws of  physics and biology change this.  But it is apparent the author has  abandoned logic and good science to appease his own personal beliefs.<br />The  author claims that the equivalence of matter and energy (e=mc2) proves no  need for a creator, or first mover.  Has he forgotton entropy?  Molecules  may move forever, but they cannot exist forever, energy would have so long  ago disapated that life would not exist.  How can one believe in the Big  Bang, the creation of all that is, and still say energy and matter have no  beginning?<br />Furthmore, both science and logic dictate that something  outside of the uninverse, independent of it, started it off.  Apparantly  the author has also ignored the overwhelming evidence for design in the  universe, unatainable by chance.<br />Despite claiming &quot;laws&quot;  disprove God, the author appeals to the &quot;theory&quot; of evolution  claming it proves complex life can come from primitive ones.  Very few will  claim that they know this is possible, logic is against it and science  doesn't  support it.  The author even invokes the famous Miller experiment  that tried to show how life could have formed spontaneously on early Earth.  Only problem with this is that the Miller experiment has been discredited  as being an unrealistic depiction of early Earth's atmosphere.<br />Physics  requires something independent of the universe to have started it off.  Intelligent Design Theory provides overwhelming evidence that that  something was an intelligent being.

True, the scientists Sproul quotes never explicitly say \\"chance has power.\\"  But as he explains, their theories require that it does have power.  Many interpretations of quantum mechanics are illogical, because they describe things they don't understand as \\"chance.\\"<br /><br />\\"Sproul, like some other Christians, is uncomfortable with scientific theories, such as the big bang theories, because they leave God out.\\"  This statement is untrue, Sproul never states or implies he is uncomfortable. In fact the big bang has quite the theological implications which is why skeptics tried (and still try) to find ways around it. Science has pointed to God for some time ([[ASIN:1576832880 The Creator and the Cosmos]], [[ASIN:0801071968 Why the Universe Is the Way It Is]]), but that really isn't what this book is about.<br /><br />It is about how illogical thinking has infected many theories and thoughts of various philosophers of science and scientists.<br /><br />That's why this book isn't just for Christians because it is by a Christian theologian. This is a well-reasoned book on logical thinking and how such thinking can be misused and twisted.

Some minor details are already dated (i.e. about some Mars  and Lunar probes), however this is the ultimate manifesto for exploring  space.<br />The only thing Zubrin could have left out was the chapter  &quot;Meeting ET.&quot;  Zubrin is obviously unware of a large amount of  astronomical discoveries that suggest with great certainity that life is  very rare.  &quot;One planet per galaxy&quot; is indeed a reasonable  estimate, contrary to Zubrin.  It seems he is a closet SETI fan, and like  many such people doesn't want to hear that life is rare (ironically many  astromers in SETI projects are the same whom make the discoveries that  point to the rarity of life).	1999-12-29

I found three mistakes, in this otherwise good book.  On Page 138, the caption incorrectly lists the dates of the Blackbird and space shuttle:  they should be 1963 and 1981, respectively.<br />On Page 135, the author says  quantum mechanics functions independently of time, this is not quite true.  One astrophysicist explains, &quot;Quantum mechanics is founded on the  concept that quantum events occur according to finite probabilities within  finite intervals of time.  The larger the time interval, the greater the  probability that event will occur...if t=0, the probability for that event  occuring is zero&quot; In other words, QM is dependent on time.<br />His  statements about religion and science needing to be separated are a bit  misguided.  Perhaps he is unware of the historic intertwining of the two:  religion once produced most of our greatest minds (Newton, Galileo, Kepler,  Corpernicus,...). The two can, and do, work together well.<br />His  inferrence that religion is nonrational shows his unfamliarity with true  Christianity (books on the agreement/compatibilty of science/Christianity  include &quot;Show me God&quot;, &quot;the &quot;Genesis Question&quot;,  &quot;the Creator and the Cosmos&quot;, etc, and on its rationality:  &quot;Love God With all Your Mind&quot;).	1999-04-27

If you think, or know someone who does, that space exploration is not important, read this book and give it to your friends and politicians.  You  will see why space exploration is quite important.	1999-04-21

Not really a survival guide, see &quot;How To  Stay Alive in the Woods&quot; for that.	1999-04-02

This is a book all wish they could write about their life.  It brings back the flavor of a nonexistent time and place better than any other memoir.  Only Ray Bradbury's  &quot;Dandelion Wine&quot; is comparable, but that was more composite than  fact.  Definitly a book for everyone.  Read the book and then see the film,  or vice versa.  The film does a fairly good job in adapting the book and  makes you want to go see it again.	1999-03-01
