Though the intention of the author is good, the examples are made unecessarily complicated to demostrate simple concepts that could confuse a beginner. The Servlet version used in this book is rather outdated (v2.1) and the discussion on WAP and WML is just enough to explain the examples specifically developed for this book. There is also a big chapter in this book explaining the outdated servlet 2.1 api.<br />Given the high cost of this book, the readers are better off buying a book on WAP and a book on Servlets separately. (Most of the books on Servlets discuss how to use XML with servlets.)	2002-04-05

A must have for any professional developer who wishes to understand JSPs and write good quality code for their project. <br />As one of the reviews mentioned, this is not a &quot;cookbook&quot; useful for churning out something in a couple of weeks  for somebody who is new to JSPs and do not care to learn what their code is capable of doing.	2001-05-20

The authors through this book explain how XML, Java servlets (and  sometimes JSPs) could be used together in applications like Shopping cart and News Bulletin board.<br />Though the book contains a lot of code, two things are disappointing. First, DOM is implicitly suggested as a preferred means for working with XML documents even in cases where simple SAX parsing would do. Secondly, JAXP 1.0 API's beta classes like XmlDocument are extensively used in the examples. Both these are not very useful in the real world scenarios.<br />Though the book gives an impression from the title that it will be using JSPs to generate the presentation layer, the examples heavily use servlets with &quot;hard coded HTML&quot; in them for this purpose.<br />I happen to have a copy of Benoit Machall's &quot;Applied XML Solutions&quot; with me with which I cannot help comparing this book with. Applied XML Solutions explains similar examples in a practical way with simpler code as well as using open source software and stabilized APIs to achieve the same results.<br />So, these are a few things to consider before buying this book!	2001-02-12

After reading through this book, I was not sure if this book is focused on Java programming or XML or Servlets and JSP programming, although it claims to be about how to integrate all these technologies together.  The book overall is not very well organized and it is tough sometimes to really make out what the authors are trying to convey.

I bought this book having read the raving reviews and that it is from o'reilly.<br />What I found was that it covers &quot;could be&quot; and &quot;may be&quot; APIs that are used to extensively in the book. Some cases in point are: JDOM api - which is still in beta form and DOM level 2 - which is not yet adopted with confidence to write production level applications. <br />I was expecting that the author would discuss writing applications using popularly used &quot;industry standard&quot; APIs.

This book is vastly revamped and is better than the  first edition. <br />Though the author rightly says in the preface that this  may not be the book for the beginners, I feel it may not be an ideal JDBC  reference book either. The emphasis of this book is on how to build a  robust middle tier that interacts with a relational database using  JDBC.<br />Though several examples appear in the book, they could be  categorized as relevant for developing a framework than useful for learning  by example. Many books that cover EJB, Servlets and JSP now a days provide  excellent stand-alone examples of using JDBC.<br />If you are looking for a  book that gives sample &quot;design patterns&quot; for building a middle  tier, then this one is for you.
