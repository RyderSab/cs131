Kolata never claimed that this was the definitive book on the flu in 1918, and mentioned Crosby all over the place. That's fine by me. The description of 1918 was so depressing I  couldn't have kept reading it for much longer. What this book really is  though is a history of 20th century science and politics. What resources  did scientists have in the 1920s? The 1950s? Today? What does it mean for  us? I stayed up late to finish this book, and admit that the ending left me  aware of all that's unresolved. Maybe in a few years there would have been  more info. Still, I enjoyed it very much. Others here have complained about  excessive characterization of specific scientists, but to me that was the  most compelling part. I want everything I read to help me think about how  to live my life. I found the depictions of both courageous and cowardly  bureaucrats, curious and smug scientists to be fascinating.	2000-07-19

It took me a few minutes tounderstand that she was saying, &quot;Thunder book.&quot; So we went to our bookshelves in search of this book, which has been a favorite of hers since it first came into our home. (She also loves her little critter CDrom of &quot;Just Grandma and Me&quot;) Last night I read the book three times and my husband read it twice, before my daughter said, &quot;Thunder all gone&quot; and was ready to move on to another book. This is the first time I've seen her use a book to process/normalize fears, and I think it's wonderful. Even though this is supposed to be for the 4-8 year old, all young children are fascinated by storms. The book doesn't minimize the scary aspects, but does give examples of ways of dealing with fear (reading a book, listening to a tape, climbing into bed with a brother) and talks about the positive aspects of thunderstorms (the adventure, roasting marshmallows in the fireplace when the lights go out, splashing in puddles the next day, and the fact that storms help flowers grow).  My only complaint is that the children do end up sleeping in their parents room which is something we're currently trying to discourage. But I'm very grateful for this book.	2000-06-16

The rhymes suggest simple ways to pretend to be an animal and always leave room for the imagination with &quot;what else can you do like a cat?&quot; questions. The illustrations  are charming in their portrayal of children engaged in pretend play. They  are also multicultural in a natural, low-key way. I think this would be  great to read to a group of children in a pre-school classroom.	2000-06-15

I loved the colorful illustrations and my daughter did enjoy the book. However, I had been expecting the typical story -- where those that didn't participate in helping didn't get to share the product. I was  surprised that after all the rounds of &quot;not I&quot; the other animals  did eat the pizza. I'm not sure what the moral is supposed to be, or if it  is one that I want for my daughter. Sure, I would like her to be generous  and share, so if she models herself after the hen, great. But I don't want  her to mimic the other animals attitudes toward helping out. The others do  help with the dishes at the end, but still.... you just need to be aware of  the change before you bring the book home.	2000-06-14

Then again, it really is meant to be read  staring out across a prairie. It touches on some of the serious questions  that Walter Benjamin was asking about the role of story in society, but  seems to me to be much more fun that a German philosopher could be. And, of  course, anyone who has had their lives transformed by a love of reading  will identify with McMurty's experience. True, I did find the last part of  the book less powerful, and McMurty does ramble on sometimes, but the  places he rambles to are SO interesting.	2000-06-14

It was occasionalty dense with scientific specifics. I'm sure that true scientists would love it, but personally I would have been more interested in additional  biographical detail. Still, Lowman's career, and her life, are a fantastic  accomplishment. It's fascinating to think about how much things have  changed in a short time. I'm going to recommend it to women scientist  friends of mine, but possibly not to armchair naturalists.	2000-06-09

This is a great start.	2000-06-09

I came to agree with many of Sammons points: that children need the capability to self-calm, self-control, and  self-entertain; that the roots of sleep problems are best addressed first  in daytime hours, and that children have more capabilities than we give  them credit for. What I didn't like was his &quot;there's just one right  way&quot; attitude. While he suggested that all children have different  needs for amount of sleep, that's where individual differences ended with  him. He seemed overly judgemental and didn't allow for possibilities of  difference. (My own personal experience plays into this as a parent of an  adopted child).  Also, the idea of a 20 minute time-out for a two-year-old  is ridiculous, and our daughter exhibits none of the behaviors Sammons  claims will happen if you don't use long time-outs. So I definitely have  mixed feelings. It's a good start if you want to think more about  independence for toddlers, but flawed.	2000-06-09

I suppose it's because parents, not the children themselves, pick the books. My daughter loves this one and asks for it again and again. True, I went through a phase of being very tired of the sing-song rhymes. However,  I've also realized how many messages she's taken from the book, including  her first word (turtle). It's helped give her words to describe her life,  and that's a great thing for books to do.	2000-06-09

This story is about China, about being an American, and about facing moral challenges. And it's humorous -- because the reader knows more  than the narrator does. It also tells how community can step in to keep  life in order. Finally, I like its portrait of marriage. So much of  literature focuses on pursuit rather than maitenance, and now that I'm  married I'm interested in the former rather than the latter.	2000-05-31

Frazier does a tremendous job of accumulating  meaningful details, juxtaposing them in poignant ways, and writing charmed  sentences. Rarely does reading history move me to tears, this one  did.<br />And I just realized this is the same guy who wrote Coyote vs. Acme.  The guy's got range.	2000-05-31

Pleasantly diverting and therapeutic	I loved this book, found it therapeutic in fact. There's a certain relief that comes with diagnosing the causes of stress and being able to step away from a feeling state (frazzled panic for example) to look at an issue  intellectually. This book, in a fairly, light breezy way, looks at how we  experience time differently than our ancestors. I found it very grounding.

He was more convincing when he wrote brilliantly about science than when he wrote bitterly about people.

Mayer considers - through the prism of one life -- the question of what our  personal responsibility should be toward injustice.
