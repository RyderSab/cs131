Ellery and his father are hired to keep him from being killed after a series of anonymous notes announces his impending murder. <br /> <br />The good: <br />The mystery.  It's a logic puzzle of a mystery, the kind Ellery Queen is rightly famous for. <br />The take-over-the-world conspiracy is a fun bonus. <br /> <br />The bad: <br />The murder, the solution, and the conspiracy are all over-the-top, but that's part of the series charm. <br /> <br />The verdict: <br />Don't expect in-depth characterization, and don't be surprised that it's dated (it's copyright 1952, after all).  Just relax and enjoy a little mental puzzle.	2005-09-21

When Albert dies, it seems that he's won after all, as a death in the family would postpone a wedding for at least 6 months. So Daphne decides to hide the body, aided unknowingly by the groom's son Graydon and the loyal butler.  <br /> <br />The good: <br />The humor.  It's reminiscent of the movie Arsenic and Old Lace, with the body disappearing, and some bumbling petty criminals. <br />Daphne.  She's a wonderful heroine--no shrinking violet, she's logical and resourceful <br />Graydon.  Likewise a wonderful hero.  He's protective, but when he discovers Daphne's involvement, he respects her and works with her. <br /> <br />The bad: <br />The emphasis is more on the comic adventure than the romance. <br /> <br />The unusual: <br />This is written in omniscient POV, which can be distancing, but it's very effective in this case. <br /> <br />The verdict: <br />This would make a fabulous movie.  As it is, it's a rollicking fun read. <br /> <br /> <br />AN ENCHANTED AFFAIR <br />Lisanne Neville can see fairies, which makes people think she's odd.  Her parents die, leaving her an orphan heiress, and her greedy uncle takes over, alternately punishing her and ignoring her.  She routinely escapes to the \\"haunted\\" woods, but this is threatened when the impoverished Duke of St. Sevrin who owns them decides to sell the timber.  She proposes marriage to him as beneficial to both--saving her woods and getting her out from under her uncle's thumb, and paying off his debts.   <br /> <br />The good: <br />Lisanne is a very strong heroine, and I liked how she took matters into her own hands and engineered her own rescue. <br />The story doesn't end with the wedding.  It shows Lisanne and St. Sevrin adjusting to marriage and working at making it a success. <br /><br />The bad: <br />It's a bit darker than most Regencies, at least at the beginning, with the abuse Lisanne suffers at her uncle's hand. <br />I wanted Lisanne to escape sooner, though I understand why she didn't. <br /> <br />The verdict: <br />Surprisingly complex for such a short book (228 p.).  It's a Cinderella story, if Cinderella had played the part of her own fairy godmother.	2005-09-21

Its purpose seems to be to set the stage for further books by introducing the characters and the world.  I haven't read the subsequent books yet, so I can't say how well it succeeds. <br /> <br />Everyone else has already given summaries, so I'll skip that and go right to my opinions. <br /> <br />The good: <br />The characters are interesting.  There's more to them than is apparent at first glance. <br />Garion himself is very convincing as a 14-year-old boy taken from his home on a quest he doesn't understand.  He's neither childish or precociously wise. <br /> <br />The bad: <br />Nothing much happens.  Sure, people are chasing them, but nothing gets resolved, and a lot of the plot threads go nowhere. <br />Garion's questions being answered with \\"you don't need to know that yet\\" got really tedious after a while. <br />The characters don't develop or change.  Things are revealed about them, but that's not the same as growth. <br /> <br />The verdict: <br />I have no idea.  I'll read the next books in the series, because I am curious...and because I've already bought them.	2005-09-21
US	51105469	RW8UROPTH3PFB	0553265741	249097119	Sacred Sins	Books	4	29	29	N	N	Opposites attract.	At least they do in Sacred Sins.   <br /> <br />A serial killer is on the prowl in D.C., and psychiatrist Tess Court has been asked to help with the investigation over the objections of one of the cops on the case, Ben Paris.  Their lifestyles are opposites:  Ben's a down-to-earth regular guy, while Tess is from a wealthy family.  And Ben has a low opinion of psychiatrists since one failed to help his brother. <br /> <br />Despite their differences and the dangers of the case, attraction blossoms and leads to love. <br /> <br />The good: <br />The relationship between Ben and his partner Ed.  Nora writes men with great understanding and affection, and that's true in this case as well. <br />The dialogue.  It flows naturally. <br />The humor.  Even though it's a more serious, suspenseful story, there are little nuggets of humor to lighten the mood. <br /> <br />The bad: <br />Tess being apparently more concerned for the killer than the victims made me want to smack her upside the head a few times. <br /> <br />The verdict: <br />A solidly entertaining romantic suspense.  For an older book, it holds up very well.	2005-09-21

Sometimes, when I dig out a book that's been in there for a long time, I kick myself for not reading it sooner.  That's not the case with this one.   <br /> <br />Crossword puzzle writer Belle and P.I. Rosco are on the trail of whoever killed two homeless people and a missing puppy.  Then Rosco disappears, and Belle starts receiving cryptic crossword puzzles that she has to solve to find him. <br /> <br />The good: <br />The puzzles are clever and fun to solve. <br />The premise is cute. <br /> <br />The bad: <br />Stilted dialogue--heck, all the writing is stilted. <br />The characters act weirdly--without motivation to do so.   <br />Gratuitous use of italics.   <br />The cryptic crossword puzzles were just tedious.  <br />While I understand that people will kill over just about anything, the motive was hard to believe. <br />And a bunch of nits too minor to mention. <br />  <br /> <br />The verdict: <br />My impression is that this was about the 6 crossword puzzles contained in the book.  The story, such as it was, was just filler.	2005-09-20

They've been public enemies for over a decade--ever since he sent her to prison for a year.  She's known as The Street Angel for her work with kids in gangs.  He's also concerned with youth gangs, but believes Bailey's going about it the wrong way, that she should leave things to the authorities, and that she shows a blatant disregard for her own safety. <br /> <br />The conflict doesn't go away just because these two fall in love.  On the contrary, it makes their differences more important and painful.  They make it in the end, of course--it is a romance, after all--but it's definitely not an easy journey. <br /> <br />The good: <br />The writing.  Nobody does emotionally charged romance better than Kathryn Shay.  The emotions of all the characters are right there on the page, and they're understandable. <br />The topic.  Ms. Shay has done her research, making the problem of youth gangs real, and the differing opinions of how to deal with them clear. <br />The characters.  Even the secondary characters--Bailey's son, brothers, co-workers, and Clay's son, and his political rival--are three-dimensional with clear motives and goals. <br /> <br />The bad: <br />I really had to agree with Clay:  Bailey took too many stupid chances with her safety, particularly since she had a young son depending on her.  It made me less able to connect with her as a character. <br />The final conflict went on a bit too long, and made me impatient. <br /> <br />The verdict: <br />This isn't a sweet, happy love story.  It's painful and emotional, and you'll stay up way too late reading it to find out how Clay and Bailey manage to earn their happy-ever-after.  But it's worth it.	2005-09-20

He chalks up the changes in her, and her insistence that she's not who he thinks she is to the fact that in the short time they were together, his wife changed dramatically, culminating in her running off with another man.  He thinks it's just more of her scheming, though he's puzzled about what she thinks to gain.   <br /> <br />Amy plays along until she can escape, and in the time together, they fall in love. <br /> <br />The good: <br />The characters.  Jason in particular was understandable and his emotions were well explained.  While I got frustrated with him not believing Amy, I never thought he was an idiot not to.  Amy was smart, and I enjoyed her logical attempts to make Jason see reason, as opposed to the more usual full-steam-ahead emotionally driven blundering of other romance heroines. <br />The twists.  When things are wrapped up in the end, there are some clever surprises.  And there were a couple of places where the story didn't go where I expected it to, for which I'm grateful. <br /> <br />The bad: <br />There were times I thought Amy was just a little too accepting of the situation, and she was too quick to forgive in the end.  It was a side effect of her logical nature, but I wanted to see a little more anger from her. <br />And there's a thread of her brother spying in France that didn't quite go anywhere.  Of course, part of that could be that it's such a short book. <br /> <br />The verdict: <br />A fun, entertaining read with some nice surprises.	2005-09-20

It's got ghosts.  It's got reincarnation.  And the time-travel ties them together.  But it works.  The ghosts & reincarnation are PART OF THE STORY.  And it doesn't go off on long boring tangents about something that happened to some dead people who nobody cares about because they were thoroughly unlikeable.  Er.  Speaking of tangents.  Anyway.   <br /> <br />Claire calls off her engagement because of the man who haunts her dreams, and then follows a ghost's clues to a labyrinth in France, where she ends up in the past, and meets Aiden, the man from her dreams, who's gone on a pilgrimage to the labyrinth to ask for guidance in dealing with his own ghost.  <br /> <br /> <br />The good: <br />Claire's reaction to the time travel was great--very realistic.   <br />All the paranormal elements are integral to the plot. <br />Aiden is a great tortured hero--everyone, including Aiden, believes that his wife had been killed by the ghost of his mistress, who'd killed herself rather than live without him, yet his concern for his people makes him want to find a wife to give him an heir, even though he doesn't feel he deserves it. <br /> <br />The bad: <br />A couple of threads were left dangling at the end, that should have been wrapped up. <br /> <br />The verdict: <br />A paranormal, time-travel romance that's entertaining and believable.	2005-09-20
US	51105469	R83D9BD1UXQYK	0451213548	8079926	A Rake's Redemption (Signet Regency Romance)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A Charming Story	Theo, Viscount Dunnley, has decided it's time to stop being a rake and to find a wife.  Since his friends have married members of \\"The Six,\\" he decides to check out the remaining single ladies of the group, reasoning that if his friends found suitable wives there, so would he. <br /> <br />Sarah Mallory seems a likely prospect, but she tends to act a bit strangely around him, as if she doesn't like him. Theo's intrigued enough by this to focus his attention a little more closely on Sarah. <br /> <br />Sarah is a bit frightened by her reaction to Theo, but she's more frightened by a threatening stalker-like suitor. As she and Theo get to know each other better, she begins to rely on him to protect her from Nasty Ned.  <br /> <br />The good: <br />Sarah's problems with Ned really highlighted for me the everyday perils of a young woman of the ton, for whom reputation is everything, or nearly so. Any action she could take other than avoidance would have much more negative consequences for her than for him. <br /> <br />I loved the hero's logical way of going about the business of finding a wife--it seemed typically male, and was written with great affection. <br /> <br />As always with this author, the witty dialogue is a pleasure to read. <br /> <br />The bad: <br />Sarah's physical reactions were a bit overdone. <br /> <br />There's not a lot of conflict. <br /> <br />The verdict: <br />A Rake's Redemption is a charming story that really pulled me in.  <br /> <br />It was also fun seeing the characters from the connecting stories again, and I'm looking forward to seeing which one of The Six finds true love next.	2005-09-19

Hijinks ensue when she leaves the statue in her old house and tries to retrieve it without his knowledge.   <br /> <br />The good: <br />The humor.  From the witty dialogue to the eccentric characters, including a mysogynistic parrot. <br />The emotions.  They're clear and on the page.  Sax's habit of taking out his frustrations on the inanimate objects in his bedroom is particularly well done.  As is Meg's guilt over having won Sax by magic warring with her desire to provide for and protect her siblings. <br /> <br />The bad: <br />I'd give this an extra half star, but Meg's stubborn insistence on not telling anyone anything went on just a wee bit too long. <br /> <br />The verdict: <br />A thoroughly delightful, romantic read.	2005-09-19
US	51105469	R3SXQ748P3TEQ7	1891946013	570166430	Night Prayers: A Vampire Novel	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Meh.	This had been on my book shelf for ages, and it had come highly recommended.  It looks like a stylish vampire story, but... it kind of falls short.   <br /> <br />The good: <br />The humor.  There are some pretty funny scenes. <br />The horror.  These vampires aren't cute fluffy bunny vamps. <br />The ideas.  Cacek has a lot of clever ideas about vampire lore. <br /> <br />The bad: <br />The editing.  It's horrible--lots of misspelled words, even misnumbered pages.   <br />The tone.  The feel of the story is really uneven.  It's kind of like a cross between MaryJanice Davidson's Betsy stories and Ann Rice, and it's not sure which it wants to be.   <br />The plot.  There are a lot of threads that are left up in the air:  a huge buildup to how to make a human servant, and then it's just dropped; lots of talk about the heroine not knowing anything about being a vampire, but she never learns, either.   <br /> <br />The verdict: <br />It seems fairly amateurish, but also the kind of book that people will praise very highly because of that.	2005-09-19

All she has is the huge old family house that's falling down around her.  The rest of the family wants to sell, and Noah is a lawyer who's come to check out the house and make an offer on behalf of his dead wife's father's company.   <br /> <br />Complicating things further, Anne is engaged to a man her sister Holly is in love with (and vice versa), and Holly, believing she's lost the man she wants, is after Noah.  And Anne initially mistakes Noah for her brother's gay lover, though that misunderstanding doesn't last long.   <br /> <br />The good: <br />The characters.  They could easily have been cliched, two-dimensional stereotypes, but they had depth.  None of them was all good or all bad, and even the heroine, Anne, wasn't perfect.  The gay brother, Ashley, was particularly well done.  He wasn't a stereotype at all, which is refreshing. <br /> <br />The conflict.  The things standing between Anne and Noah were real problems, not something that could be resolved in a short conversation. <br /> <br />The bad: <br />The Cinderella tale is a common story, and Anne's family's actions toward her were a little overdone in spots. <br /> <br />The verdict: <br />For a 20-year-old category romance, Housebound holds up exceptionally well.  I've been picking up Anne Stuart's backlist here and there, and will continue to do so.	2005-09-12
US	51105469	RPMZ5X43R3PUA	0671795937	381852442	Rogue Warrior	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Fascinating	I'd read all the Rogue Warrior fiction before picking this up, so I'd seen a lot of the information before.  It was great, though, to have the whole story laid out, without apology or maudlin sentimentality. <br /> <br />The good: <br />The story itself.  Having been in and around the military for 22 years and counting, Marcinko's story is not surprising, but it is inspiring. <br />The pacing.  Anyone can write non-fiction, right?  It's just a matter of writing down what happened.  Wrong.  The book reads like a novel, with exciting parts and slower parts, and never got bogged down in slow recitation of facts. <br />The voice.  This is what keeps me reading the Rogue Warrior fiction.  Straightforward, uncompromising, with an underlying humor.  It's irresistible. <br /> <br />The bad: <br />The cursing.  Cursing doesn't bother me.  But if it bothers you, this is probably not the book for you. <br />The voice.  I enjoy it, but I'm sure it's a matter of taste.  It's such a strong voice that if you don't like it, it's going to grate on you through the whole book. <br /> <br />The verdict: <br />Entertaining, inspiring, and infuriating.	2005-09-03

It's still an adventure-filled read, and while I noticed the parallels to LOTR much more this time around, they didn't bother me so much for two reasons: 1) Brooks's prose is so much more readable and exciting.  He doesn't go off on pages-long tangents describing grass and trees, for example.  2) This isn't the end of the story.  It may have started out with a Tolkein-esque story, but it's gone on since then.  That's hardly a defense of this book, of course, but it's where the series starts, and I give it credit for that. <br /> <br />The good: <br />The pacing.  There's always something happening. <br />The adventure.  Good vs. evil, always a good concept. <br />The characters.  They're flawed.  Nobody's perfect.   <br />The emotion.  In contrast to a lot of fantasy, the characters' inner lives are as important to the story as the creatures that are opposing them. <br /> <br /> <br />The bad: <br />The parallels to Tolkein, of course. <br />The lack of female characters. <br /> <br />The verdict: <br />Realize that there will be parallels to LOTR beforehand, then read it anyway.   <br />	2005-09-03

It was fascinating, with its blend of historical and fictional characters, and the convincing way in which one clue leads to another. <br />The characters, particularly genealogist Natasha Blake and the artist's model Bethany Marshall.  They're richly drawn and understandable. <br />The tone.  The story has a dreamy, at times almost surreal feel to it, fitting perfectly with the art. <br />The research.  It was very thorough, providing rich detail without resorting to infodumps. <br /> <br />The bad: <br />The premise.  It didn't seem realistic that Adam would ask a genealogist to find his missing girlfriend, or that there was any reason to believe she could be successful. <br />The attraction between Natasha and Adam.  It threw me every time it came up, because I couldn't see a foundation for it or point to it. <br />The solution.  There was a lot of build-up, but the ending itself was anticlimactic.   <br /> <br />The verdict: <br />I liked the main character and the genealogical investigation enough to recommend this one with reservations, and to check out the next one.	2005-09-01

Connor abducts and marries Brenna while she's on her way to marry his enemy, using as his justification the fact that she'd asked him to marry her... when she was a small child.   <br /> <br />Despite her tendency to get herself in trouble, Brenna's also eminently practical, and she determines to make the best of her marriage, frequently informing Connor that they're \\"starting over\\" whenever things go awry. <br /> <br />The good: <br />The interactions between Brenna and Connor.  Each is clueless about the other's motives, but they both want to make things work.  I never wanted to smack either of them upside the head. <br />The pacing.  The Wedding was hard to put down.  There was something happening on every page. <br />The humor.  I laughed aloud several times. <br />The characters.  Both the main characters and the secondary ones are entertaining and likeable.  Well, except for the villains.  They were just entertaining. <br /> <br />The bad: <br />The tone feels a bit modern. <br />There are a couple of dropped plot threads. <br />The heroine describes herself as having breasts that are too large and hips that are too narrow.  I admit this is a pet peeve of mine. <br /> <br />The verdict: <br />A cookie read.  A fun, sweet, entertaining way to spend a few hours.	2005-08-29
US	51105469	RZZADNCIHL9GJ	0515138975	290726069	Lyon's Gate: Bride Series	Books	3	3	5	N	N	Could use a good editing.	Jason Sherbrooke returns to England from America after a long absence and ends up in competition with Hallie Carrick for the estate of Lyon's Gate. <br /> <br />The good: <br />The banter. <br />The overall story:  the pair forced into proximity, the recovery from emotional wounds, the romance based on mutual respect and admiration rather than just attractiveness. <br /> <br />The bad: <br />The backstory.  It takes a good third of the book before the story even starts.  I haven't read all of the previous Sherbrooke books, though I've read some, so perhaps longtime readers of the series would enjoy reading in detail everything every member of the family has been up to. <br />The lack of backstory.  The tragedy that sent Jason Sherbrooke away from England in the first place is referred to multiple times, and I appreciate the idea to make the reader wait to find out until Hallie does, but the secrecy is clumsily done and doesn't feel natural.   <br />The writing.  The best I can describe it is choppy, jumping from subject to subject.  It's kind of like a radio with static: you feel like you're missing every third word.  I tried, with the first half of the book, then I skimmed the rest, and it went much better. <br />The format.  The extra $2 for a book that's an inch taller and won't fit comfortably on your shelves is not worth it. <br /> <br /> <br />The verdict: <br />It's really a shame.  If it hadn't been written like a series of notes jotted down, I'd have given it at least 4 stars.  If you're a fan of the series, check it out from the library, or wait and see if it'll come out in regular paperback.	2005-08-25

A reckless earl sees her in a dispute with her governess on the street, and his friend bets him that he can't make her the toast of the ton.   <br /> <br />There's also a murder mystery and the ongoing search for the natural father of the heroine from the previous book & her brother (hero of a yet earlier book).   <br /> <br />It's a really nice series, and by the end of this book, we've picked up several more connections who are begging for their own books. <br /> <br />The good: <br />The mystery.  Clarissa and Whitby join forces to discover who murdered the former matron of the foundling home, a murder that implicates Clarissa. <br />The humor.  A staple of Regency-era romances is the witty dialogue, and Gilding the Lady is no exception. <br />The series connections.  In contrast to many romance series, characters from previous or future books don't just make token appearances, they're integral to the story.  There is also an ongoing series plot that ties the books together. <br /> <br />The bad: <br />While Gilding the Lady does give you enough information that you can read it without having read the other books in the series, you will get more out of it if you've read the others. <br /> <br />The wonderful: <br />Watching Clarissa regain a sense of her own worth, Whitby mature from the heedless, devil-may-care earl into a caring, thoughtful hero. As in all the best love stories, the romance between them is both a cause and a result of their personal growth.  <br /> <br />The verdict: <br />Gilding the Lady has Nicole Byrd's trademark blend of romance, mystery, wit, and sensuality.

I've been reading Rebecca York's books for a while, and she just keeps getting better and better.  The suspense and the romance in Beyond Control are balanced perfectly, with each unfolding at the same pace and with the same intensity. <br /> <br />It's a story of two people uncovering a conspiracy that dates back to their own births, and it's a story of two people who've spent their entire lives alone, set apart from other people because of their psychic abilities, finding an intimacy that's deeper than they could ever have imagined, and coming to terms with it. <br /> <br />The good: <br />The suspense.  I spent a lot of this book on the edge of my seat. <br />The secondary characters.  They're all well-developed, and understandable. <br />The love scenes.  Well-written and HOT!--the psychic connection worked very well. <br />The way the many threads of the book meshed seamlessly. <br /> <br />The bad: <br />You do have to read the first couple of chapters carefully to keep all the characters straight, but it's more than worth it. <br /> <br />The truly excellent: <br />The intensity and honesty of the emotions between the main characters. <br /> <br />The verdict: <br />An absolute keeper that I'll read again and again.	2005-08-14

Much fun ensues when a librarian goes after the lost library of Alexandria in the company of a man who's being hunted by the French Foreign Legion for desertion. <br /> <br />The good: <br />The banter.  Abigail and Apollo's banter had me laughing out loud. <br />The adventure.  It's fast-moving and exciting. <br />The book references.  Abigail has learned everything she knows from books, and is constantly referring to them.  It's funny and occasionally poignant. <br />All the twists and turns in the plot.  There's one after the other. <br /> <br />The bad: <br />Not a thing, as long as you suspend your disbelief and just go along for the ride. <br /> <br />The surprising: <br />That in such a fun, romantic adventure, you also get character development and growth. <br /> <br />The verdict: <br />A wonderful read, particularly for fans of The Mummy, or Elizabeth Peters' Amelia Peabody series.	2005-08-14

(hey, I wasn't paying all that close attention to the setting--believe me, you wouldn't either.  &lt;g>  suffice to say it was public)  And that's just the beginning. <br /> <br />I wasn't sure what to expect from this book, but it wasn't what I got.  With all the explicit sex scenes, you might expect it to be erotica, but there's a depth of emotion in this book that makes it more than that.   <br /> <br />The good: <br />Explicit sex scenes that don't make you cringe, giggle, or skim. <br />Three-dimensional characters, including the secondary characters. <br />A no-way-out plot that was solved honestly. <br /> <br />The bad: <br />If you're at all squeamish about explicit sex scenes or graphic language, this book isn't for you. <br />I didn't expect I'd be needing the Kleenex, and I had to go hunt for some.  *sniff* <br /> <br />The excellent: <br />The in-depth emotional portrayal of a couple whose passion unlocks the needs and feelings they've kept hidden. <br /> <br />The verdict: <br />I've been recommending this to everyone, and Lisa Valdez has shot straight to my must-buy list on the strength of one single book.	2005-08-13

I know SJ is known for her sex scenes, but what I don't know is WHY.  They're...  dull.  But the story itself was actually pretty good.   <br /> <br />Stella Scott is a comic book store owner.  Danny Rees designs computer games & is richer than... she calls him a kazillionnaire, which seems pretty appropriate.   <br /> <br />Somebody's broken into his office, trying to steal the details of his new game. She looks like a suspect, and he doesn't talk about any details of his game designing, so she thinks he's just saying he's a game designer when he's really a drug dealer.  So they each suspect each other, while in the meantime they can't keep their hands (& other body parts) off each other.   <br /> <br />In addition, there's a nice secondary romance between a confirmed bachelor & a divorced mom who's sworn off marriage. <br /> <br />The good: <br />The comic store setting. <br />The mutual suspicion which could be cleared up by just talking to each other, but it makes sense that they don't. <br />The secondary romance. <br /> <br />The bad: <br />The ho-hum sex scenes. <br /> <br />The verdict: <br />Wait until it's out in mass market size or get it at your library unless you're a big Susan Johnson fan.	2005-08-13

It's what all fantasy books should be--an epic tale, full of adventure, intrigue, romance, humor, and suspense, set in a world that's different from our own.  Unlike many other books in this genre, Furies is fast-paced and full of action, yet with plenty of details to put the reader firmly in the realm of Alera, where magic, in the form of earth, air, fire, water, wood, & metal furies, is an everyday occurrence. <br /> <br />Also notable is the depth of characterization.  Jim Butcher has created a fairly large cast of characters and made each of them vividly real, with strengths and weaknesses, good points and bad, all painted in shades of gray. <br /> <br />The good: <br />The worldbuilding.  It's layered in amongst the action, not handed out in long lists of descriptions that you'd tend to skip. <br />The characters.  All well-rounded, all with strengths and weaknesses, all with individual voices. <br />The pace.  There's something happening on every page.  You never get bogged down. <br />The writing style.  It's clear and vivid, particularly noteworthy in the action scenes, which I have no trouble following, contrary to my experience with other books/authors. <br /> <br />The bad: <br />It's kind of long to read in one sitting, but you'll want to. <br /> <br />The excellent: <br />The intrigue.  I'm a sucker for intrigue, and this book (the whole series) has it in spades.  Lots of little clues hidden here and there that you only pick up on a second (or third or fourth) reading that give you hints about what's to come in the series. <br /> <br />The verdict: <br />Absolutely wonderful. I couldn't recommend it more highly.	2005-08-13

I'm very glad I did. <br /> <br />The good: <br />The way the hero uses engineering to solve the mystery. <br />The political details were realistic and infuriating. <br /> <br />The bad: <br />Can't really find anything. <br /> <br />The excellent: <br />The characterizations.  The characters were a lot more three-dimensional and emotionally complex than I'd have expected from a simple mystery novel. <br /> <br />The verdict: <br />I'll be looking for the rest of John Billheimer's books, and this time they won't be sitting in my TBR pile forever.	2005-08-13

This time around, the primary source is that forwarded email that starts \\"men are like...\\" <br /> <br />If it weren't for the distracting tedium of the jokes taken in order and word for word from those forwarded e-mails, this would be a fun series, with clever mysteries and engaging characters.	2005-08-12

Dearly Depotted takes up where the previous Slay It with Flowers left off, with Abby busy with her cousin Jillian's wedding and Trudee DeWitt's 4th of July extravaganza--all on the same day. <br /> <br />And of course things go wrong. There are pink instead of red carnations, a groomsman with a sprained ankle, and a wandering grandmother. To top it off, she has to wear The World's Ugliest Bridesmaid Dress in front of the hunky Marco. <br /> <br />But all that tends to pale next to finding another dead body when Abby goes looking for the groom's missing grandmother. Abby had promised her friend Grace to stop meddling in murder, but when Grace's new boyfriend turns out to be the prime suspect, Grace reluctantly asks for Abby's help. <br /> <br />This series is a fun blend of clever mysteries and an engaging and quirky cast of characters that just get more interesting with each book. I'm looking forward to the next, and hoping this will be a good long series.	2005-08-09

Our heroine, Lucinda, is a Malcolm, a family whose women tend to have varied psychic or magical talents. Her particular talent shows up in her paintings which portray things that have happened or might happen in the future. <br /> <br />The trouble starts when one of her paintings results in the hero, Sir Trevelyan Rochester, being accused of his cousin's murder. Trev is furious, and sets out to find the mysterious artist and force her to confess that his uncle hired her to paint the damning picture. Lucinda, on the other hand, decides to retire, incognito, to the country and paint nothing but landscapes, hoping to avoid such disturbing occurrences in the future. <br /> <br />But magic can't be denied, and Lucinda's subsequent paintings draw her further into the intrigue. <br /> <br />The rest of the story is an exciting quest to find what happened to the cousin, featuring romance, psychic abilities, & the family members from previous books in this series, particularly the mysterious Aidan... <br /> <br />It was wonderful visiting with this family again, and I particularly enjoyed Trev coming to terms with magic. As someone unfamiliar with the notorious Malcolms, it took him a long time to believe, and his skepticism was very believable. <br /> <br />Along with the adventure and romance is a healthy dose of humor that really makes these books a joy to read.  Much Ado About Magic has got magic, romance, intrigue, humor, and history.  What more could you ask for?	2005-08-07

The women of the Chase family are known for their sweets, and the recipes and associated legends add an extra bit of flavor (sorry about that!) to this entertaining Regency romance.   <br /> <br />Duty is Alexandra's middle name.  As the oldest sister, she's always done what was expected, and always put her family first. She's been in love with Tristan since she was a young girl, but knew he wasn't meant for her and that he was expected to marry well.  She's on the verge of doing so when Tristan shows up, with a title and a scandal, and her duty is still clear, but it's suddenly much more difficult to resign herself. <br /> <br />These star-crossed lovers are engaging, sympathetic characters, as are the rest of the Chase family.  I'm looking forward to the rest of the books in this series.	2005-08-07

When the P.I. catches up with her, she says it was the father who killed the wife & she took the child to protect him.   <br /> <br />Lots of trust issues, and a kid who's not overly cute or precocious, as well as some top-notch suspense.

This is the 11th book in this \\"mystery of ancient Ireland\\" series featuring Sister Fidelma. As with the previous ones, it's full of interesting 7th century historical details, this time including Wales.  <br /> <br />There are two mysteries that overlap, though perhaps not the way you'd expect: everyone in a monastery has disappeared without a trace, along with the livestock and some of the valuables; and a young woman is murdered. <br /> <br />Fidelma and Eadulf have been tasked by the Welsh king with solving the first mystery but have been given strict instructions by the local authority not to interfere in the second. <br /> <br />While the historical details are fascinating, at times they get in the way of the story.  There are also 4 characters whose names begin with the letter I, which tends to make things confusing--a pet peeve of mine.  Still, the mystery is well thought out, and there are some good twists, as well as a little personal development in the protagonists' lives.	2005-07-20

It's kind of unfortunate that this was packaged as a 2-in-1 with the Redhead & the Rake, because the heroine in that one was surnamed Dancy, but she's absolutely no relation to the Lord Dancy in this one.   <br /> <br />The heroine, who was raised by Chinese woman/companion, is rescued by Lord Dancy 3 times, so she informs him she's now \\"his\\". And sees it as her duty to watch over him.  She keeps rescuing him, which irritates the heck out of him, and is very much fun to read.   <br /> <br />Once again, Ms. Hendrickson has written a wonderfully strong, smart, yet eminently likeable heroine. Amelia Longworth takes her duty to Lord Dancy very seriously, and she's clever enough to deal with threats to him in manners suited to her strengths, rather than the more usually seen heroine whose heart would be in the right place, but who would blunder in and make things worse.  <br /> <br />The only problem is, I liked the hero's best friend much better than the hero, who was really a jerk to the heroine.  Still gets 4 stars for being fun.	2005-07-20

She's rescued, near death, and taken aboard Captain Sir Nicholas Sidney's ship. <br /> <br />Thus begins a dense, adventure-filled story. Julianna's father is missing--in fact, the entire ship they were on is missing--and she presumes he's dead. Until a letter arrives from him with cryptic message saying only that he's alive and well, and signed with his initials, which are also the initials of a French spy. Julianna enlists Nicholas's aid in finding her father. <br /> <br />In addition to the search for Julianna's father and the spy, there's also a fortune hunter to contend with, and the negative impressions local Society has of Americans to overcome. <br /> <br />The adventure is lively and well-written, and the shipboard sequences are very vivid and realistic.  Often, in the shorter format (214 pages), something's got to give, and in this case, it's the relationship.  I'd have liked to see more interaction between the hero and heroine and the development of their feelings for each other.	2005-07-20

All three main characters (Sophie, Gideon, and Lady May) have deep emotional wounds, and those are explored fully, without either lapsing into melodrama or sidestepping difficult issues. The more Sophie falls in love with Gideon, the more her secret weighs on her, yet the harder it is for her to tell him because his regard is so important to her. And the same goes for Gideon and Lady May. And the ending.... Heart-wrenching and satisfying.  <br /> <br />In addition to the romance between Sophie and Gideon, there are two secondary romances, which are like icing on an already scrumptious cake. <br /> <br />The cover, as well, is very appropriate:  The mask, hiding the characters' secrets. <br /> <br />Seems I can't find anything to complain about at all.	2005-07-20

New.  I never do that.   <br /> <br />True North is a romantic comedy, not unlike Crusie's--that is, it's funny & romantic, but it's got depth.  Workaholic Claire Brown's fiance takes another woman on the romantic vacation Claire gave him for his birthday, but Claire's not about to give up.   <br /> <br />The hijinks and sparks between Claire and laid-back lodge owner John McBride stop short of slapstick, and there's some real emotional development for both of them, which for me pushes True North from being just a fun read to a truly excellent one.	2005-07-20

There was no spark to them, and the author told the reader what the characters were feeling rather than showing the emotions through actions or dialogue.
