I know this is not an easy task for fans of Plum, but if you are able to do this you will find that the writing style of Janet Evanovich will shine through in Metro Girl. <br /> <br />The book opens with a mysterious phone call the Barney receives in the middle of the night from her brother Bill.  Barney decides that she either must find Bill so the next morning she flies down to Florida in search of her missing brother.  After she teams up with the Sexy Sam Hooker or NASCAR Guy as she refers to him often she finds herself in the middle of an adventure with non stop Action and many memorable characters. <br /> <br />I hope that Evanovich Fans will be able to read these books as separate entities and just enjoy the wit and story in Metro Girl, and hold off the Stephanie Plum thought until the 11th Plum will be released.  I would definitely continue reading the Metro Girl series but seriously advise everyone to not to compare. <br />	2004-11-29

They form a very strong friendship but each one lives a completely different life.

Most of the characters were kind of bland and I couldn't care for them with one exception, Lonnie, Binx's handicapped half brother.

This book really didn't have too much of a plot but it was more like a series of short stories which is my biggest complaint with the book.  Although I did find the short chapters easy and fast to read, I felt that the author had the potential to come up with a true 5 star book with this great cast of character.<br />The book is set in the small town of Elmwood Springs and the main character is Neighbor Dorothy who is the host of a local radio show.  In the first part of the book we are introduced to her family but later in the second we follow the story of Betty Rae and Hamm, and last we follow Norma and Macky.  I truly loved all of these characters and I wanted more details about what happened to them instead of brief updates in other parts.  I really wanted to know about Bobby's life after leaving town and more about Betty Raye as Governor.<br />Overall I have to say it was enjoyable and I would have rated it higher than 3 stars but I felt it could have been better.  This is the first book I have read by Fannie Flagg and I do plan to read more book by her.	2003-02-06

I am still in awe of how this family survived this terrible ordeal and I couldn't put this book down until I found out what would happen next.<br />This book is about the family of General Oufkir in Morocco and is being told by his eldest daughter Malika.  Malika was raised in the palace and adopted by King Mohammed as a playmate for Princess Lalla Mina.  King Mohammed died suddenly and his son King Hasan became Malika's adopted father.  She left the palace to return to her family when she was 17 and by the time she was 19 she was imprisoned along with the rest of her family because her father had staged an unsuccessful coup.  We learn of the unbelievable horrendous conditions these people had to live with, they had very little food and the conditions were not sanitary.  They were only given Tide to wash up with and had to use salt as toothpaste.  Their cells were infested with all kinds of insects, mice and rats but somehow this family found the will to survive it all.  <br />This is a story of survival  and courage which will totally captivate you.  This book is a fast read because its the type of book that made me stay up late to finish while I was yawning at my desk in the morning.  I highly recommend reading this book.	2003-01-26

What I didn't like about the book was the use of drugs and how drug use was considered normal and how children was encouraged to play sexual games.  My only complaint with the writing of this book is with the character of Bernard.  I thought that he would be the character to rebel against the system but he seemed to sell out at the end.<br />I guess science fiction isn't my genre and I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who felt the same.	2003-01-26

Susie watches her father's attempt to bring her murderer to justice, her sister live the life that she might have and the boy that she kissed go on with life.

This was too unreal for me and I had no sympathy what so ever for Nanny.  I did have sympathy for the child and I wondered how come nobody took this kid to therapy which he obviously was in bad need of.<br />I did give this book 3 stars because I did feel there were a few laughs and it was a fast read but this is not something I would recommend to anyone.	2003-01-21

Luther spends a sleepless night figuring out how much money they spent on Christmas last year, $6, 100 dollars.  He decides to talk his wife Nora into taking a cruise instead of spending all that money on Christmas and Nora agrees due to the fact that her daughter will not be around.  What happens next is the hilarious and sometimes rude reactions from the neighbors and friends due to the fact that the Kranks are not decorating, sending cards or buying presents.  On Christmas Eve the Kranks do get a surprise which changes their plans at the last minute and this is when the book get even more hilarious.<br />I found this book to be one of the most enjoyable Christmas stories that I have read in a very long time and Luther is definitely a modern day Scrooge.

I truly loved reading this book and all throughout the book I couldn't help saying to myself what a Remarkable person Ruth Mc Bride Jordan really was to raise all of those children under the worst circumstances, to receive no help from any of her family and still have every one of these children educated and professional people.  I truly admire this woman and I don't know if I would have never been able to do the same under those circumstances.  She is an inspiration to all mothers everywhere.<br />One of my most favorite scenes in this book is when he is questioning his Mother about God and what color he is, and his mother tells him that God is the Color of Water.

The characters are very realistic and you get a true understanding of all the emotions that they are feeling.<br />Fran Benedetto, a nurse who lives in NYC and seems to be happily married to her husband Bobby but she is a victim of Domestic Violence.  The book deals more with Fran trying to escape her situation by going underground and assuming a new identity with her son Robert but its extremely hard to run away from a police officer.  I was able to feel the suspense on every page wondering if or when her husband would catch up to her.<br />Anna Quindlen does an excellent job describing each and every emotion that Fran must have been feeling and this book gave me a new understanding of Spousal Abuse.  This book is a real pageturner and it is one I would highly recommend and I would also highly recommend One True Thing also written by Ms. Quindlen.	2002-12-29

I really didn't think that I would like this book at all but it turned out that I was wrong and I was really captivated by the story of Artemisia Gentileschi, who was the first women to be admitted into Accademia dell' Arte in Florence.<br />The story of Artemisia Gentileschi begins with the trial of Agostino Tassi, who raped Artemeisia and is her fathers assistant.  During the trial it is Artemisia that is physically tortured by the trial and its outcome.  This experience becomes the inspiration for some of the violence that is displayed in her paintings.  <br />Susan Vreeland has done an excellent job in describing the meaning and reasoning behind each of the paintings and creates strong characters who remain in your memory for a long time.

This timeless classic of four sister growing up during the Civil War is my all time favorite book and I do not even know how many times I have read it. I treasure my copy of this book and it is one I could never part with.  <br />Little Women is a coming of age story about four sisters Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy, and it always amazed me how Marmee would sit back and let them learn life's lessons and always find the right words to say to each of them afterward.  Family values and morals as well are hard lessons to teach but through love and understanding they all learn.<br />Jo is my favorite character, she is so vibrant and full of life and the character based on Louisa May Alcott herself.  My favorite movie version of this movie is the 1933 version with Katherine Hepburn as Jo, she truly captured Jo's spirit.  <br />This story has been read by many generations and I'm sure that there will be many more generations enjoying the story of Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy for many many years to come.	2002-10-20

The story was able to captivate me even though I really didn't like most of the characters in this book.  My favorite character was a little girl named Billie, who had a terrible domestic life but seemed to overcome this obstacle and represented hope for the citizens of this town.  <br />Limoges Louisiana is a town where gossip rules and the wholesome life is anything but wholesome.  Adultery, wife beating and even the town's minister is raping young girls are some of the problems this town faces but its the gossip that I consider its doom.  There is one part where the author compares gossip to a disease spreading that I thought was brilliant.<br />This book was captivating and I enjoyed reading this one even though I couldn't like more than two or three character, but the story is what we will keep you interested.  The recipes sounded good and I loved the way the author inserted them into the book as if they were part of the story.  I would recommend reading She Flew The Coop.	2002-10-19

Barbara Kingslover creates very believable and strong characters and the descriptions makes you feel like you are truly in the Congolese Jungle.<br />The Poisonwood Bible takes us into the Congolese jungle and we view it through the eyes of the four Price Girls, Rachel, Leah, Adah and Ruth May.  Their father Nathan is a Baptist minister who is on a mission to convert the Congolese people into Christianity and he takes the girls along with their mother to Africa.  Each and every member of this family, changes through this experience never to be the same again.<br />This was the first book I read by Barbara Kingslover and I do plan on reading more by her.	2002-10-18

We follow the lives of Elisabeth, Suzette, Philomene and Emily (who is the Great Grandmother of the author) all of these women were very strong which enabled them to make a living for themselves throughout many troubled times they faced in their lives.<br />Slavery is always a subject that can shock you everytime your exposed to it and this book gives an accurate account of it.  We learn about the lives of these women as slaves and how they didn't even have the basic right to refuse sexual advances of their masters.  <br />Another thing that always affects me about slavery is how they could break up families by selling them, I ached for Palmire when her children were sold.  And one of the most beautifully written scenes in this book was when Elisabeth and her husband Gerasime were lying in bed talking about their lives together the night before a slave auction, they both knew that they would be sold to different owners and this would be their last night together.<br />Lalita Tademy really did her homework with this book and she included many photos, letter and even bill of sales from slave auctions.  The story is well written, poignant and realistic and I do recommend reading it	2002-10-13

I enjoyed the many plot twist and turns which held my interest and kept me up at nights wondering what would happen next.  <br />The Piper family's story is a tragic one, and this family has to be one of the most dysfunctional families that I had ever read about, however I felt the writing was excellent and I really wanted to see what would happen next to these people although I was very dissapointed with the ending.<br />I do have one complaint about the publishers reviews on the back of the cover which describe this book as &quot;Humorous&quot; and &quot;Hilarously Funny.&quot;  This book is sad and if you are looking for a laugh you will be mislead by the reviews.<br />The characters and the plot is interesting, even though this is a tragic story.

These characters seemed like real people to me especially Danny and Ria's children, Annie and Brian, who's dialogue sounded so much like the way real siblings would talk to each other.  Maeve Binchy also gave us characters that we could truly love (Ria, Colm and Marilyn) plus she created characters that you can truly hate (Danny and Rosemary)  I also like the way the author used the house on Tara Road as a symbol of Danny and Ria's marriage and dreams.  <br />This was the first book that I have read by Maeve Binchy but I will definitely be reading many more, especially since I really hated for this book to end.  This was a real pageturner and I would highly recommend it to everyone.	2002-09-01

Anita Diamant is an excellent writer who has brilliantly adapted a biblical story that was just a mere mention in the Bible and turned it into a whole book and an excellent one at that.<br />This is the story of Dinah (Jacob's daughter and Joseph's sister) and her mothers Leah, Rachel, Zilpah, and Bilhah.  I thought it was interesting to read about the customs that the women followed during that period of time especially about the way the celebrated their monthly cycle and how they beared children.  <br />I looked up the passage in the bible that refers to Dinah and the authors account of the facts was accurate, but most of the story is fictional.  We know that the bible was written by men in a time when women were second class citizens, but this book makes you think that maybe there are more women in the bible that could have her story as told as compelling as Dinah's.  I hope that Ms. Diamant or maybe another writer can bring more of these stories to life, but for now I highly recommend reading The Red Tent.	2002-08-25

Robert Morgan is an amazing writer and I truly enjoy reading his books.<br />Ginny and Tom were well written and very real characters.  They fought a lot about Ginny's religious beliefs and Tom being a true workaholic but I never doubted for one minute that they were devoted to their marriage and that they loved each other.  This marriage teaches us a great lesson, you never appreciate what you have until you lose it.<br />Through the vivid descriptions of Ginny and Tom's workload, this book has made me appreciate all of the modern conviences that we have today even more.  <br />This book was well written and enjoyable.  I would recommend this book as well as Gap Creek to anyone and I'm looking forward to reading more books by Robert Morgan.	2002-08-19

I found it a very quick book to read, but I was extremely dissapointed with it.  The storyline was flat, I didn't care about any of the character (with the exception of Kemal) and most of the plot twist were predictable.<br />The main character Dana Evans travels to all ends of the earth to investigate the &quot;accidental deaths of all 5 members of the Winthrop family.  Meanwhile she leaves her troubled son for long periods of time with anyone she can hire and she never even questions why he is sleeping all the time.  Nor does she ever question why so many people that she has just met are extremely helpful to her.  Plus I don't know any woman who would just let her boyfriend take care of his ailing supermodel ex-wife, when the ex-wife probaly had enough money to hire a whole nursing staff.  <br />The better story would have been the relationship between Dana and Kemal.  Kemal is an 11 year old orphan who lost his arm during the war and Dana decides to adopt him.  He is always afraid that she will send him back and I can not blame him for thinking that because she never spends any time with him.<br />If you want to read a 5 star book from Sidney Sheldon pick up &quot;Rage of Angels&quot; and skip this one.	2002-07-04

When I first seen &quot;I Know This Much Is True&quot; I was reluctant to read it due to its size, but I enjoyed &quot;She's Come Undone&quot; so much I decided to give it a try.  I loved it just as much as &quot;She's Come Undone&quot; if not more.  There were plot twist and turns all the way until the end and the story totally captivated me.  Wally Lamb has now earned himself a place on my favorite authors list.<br />Characters such as Joy and Thad could have been left out (along with the biography of the Grandfather) but mostly all of the characters were realistic and well written.  I am anxiously waiting for Mr. Lamb's next book and I will read it as soon as its available no matter how many pages are in it.  I highly recommend reading the book all 900 pages.	2002-05-29

Books	2	11	27	N	N	Unrealistic Characters	This book was a fast read but the characters and their actions were too unbelivable and unrealistic.  The plot was interesting (which is the main reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one) during the flashbacks to the 1970's, but the parts in France were not interesting at all.<br />Berie and Sils are two friends who are working through their summer vacation at The Storyland Theme Park.  Sils is the pretty one who lands a job playing Cinderella, while Berie who has yet to blossom, sells tickets at the entrance gate.  The boys are attracted to Sils and she gets herself into trouble.  Sils wants to have an abortion but does not have enough money.  Berie comes up with a scam to sell used tickets stubs and helps her friend raise the funds.<br />The friendship between the two girls didn't seem strong enough to warrant Berie's actions, and not one of these character seemed real to me at all.  The flashbacks are the only reason I continued to read this book, and eventually I found myself skipping over the French parts with Berie and her husband.  Thankfully this was a fast and short read and I would not reccommend reading this book.	2002-04-25

I was totally captivated by this story and I had a hard time putting it down.<br />Penn Cage, a famous lawyer and novelist, decides to return to his home in Missisippi with his young daughter after the untimely death of his wife.  He teams up with newspaper editor Caitlin Masters to investigate a 30 year old civil rights murder that has been left unsolved.  The suspense of solving this crime kept me turning the pages all night long.  There are so many plot twists and turns that I just had to find out what would happen next.<br />The only complaint I do have is with the last quarter of the book where Caitlin is hardly heard from at all.  I really liked the character and I wished she would have been partners with Penn all the way to the end.  <br />The book is well written with strong characters, action packed, and I was sorry that it had to end.  I plan to read more books by Greg Iles because of how much I enjoyed this one and I think his writing style is excellent.  I would highly recommend reading this book to everybody.	2002-04-07

The boat ride on the lake in the beginning and the ice skating scene later on was romantic and beautiful.  Daniel's sermon on grief after the death of one his parishoners was poignant, and showed how a good minister can preach to a whole group but make you feel like he is talking to you personally.  And what pet owner wouldn't shed a tear when poor Arthur had to be put to sleep.<br />Jo Becker, the main character of this book, I found to be selfish along with other reviewers, but thats what makes her seem so real to me.  In real life people are not perfect and to show her flaws while keeping her likeable is just great writting.  Even Daniel who seems so perfect shows another side to him, when he throws a tomato at Jo in anger.<br />This book was very enjoyable and hard to put down.  I highly recommend reading this book or any other written by Sue Miller.	2002-03-18

I was willing to give the author creative license with the story of Stephen the Wolfman but she left too many questions unanswered.  Here are a few but there are more:<br />Why was Robin able to walk right out of the hospital with Stephen and nobody ever questioned his whereabouts?<br />Why did the guard unlock the handcuffs so quickly on just Robin's say so?<br />Why did Robin want to bring him into her household while she was going through a messy divorce and money problems?<br />How come Stephen learned to read, write and play chess so quickly?<br />I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone but I do recommend reading &quot;Local Girls&quot; also by Ms. Hoffman.

There are a few flaws with the plot and characters, but if you can overlook them this is an enjoyable read.<br />The main plot involving Larry Cook giving the land to his daughters and later fighting them in court to get it back was intriguing, however I felt the sexual abuse turned this into a bad TV movie of the week.  It would have been more interesting if Ms. Smiley would have the more with the issue of the well water causing Rose's cancer and Ginny's miscarriages,  which would have tied right in with the main plot of the land tearing this family apart and explained why Jess was always there.<br />The problem with the characters is that you can never figure any of them out.  Ginny didn't seem like the type to commit adultry or attempt murder, yet she did both.  I never understood how Rose could help with her father's care and still carry such hatred for him.  And why Ty became so cold to Ginny after the problems with her father started is still baffling me.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who can forgive some flaws because it is enjoyable especially if you love to read descrptions written well.	2002-02-10

They were raised by their mother Roxie who was a prostitute and brought her work home with her.  Rhonda eventually marries a man who victimizes her even more and Darla dreams of moving to New York to become a dress designer. <br />I really admire Darla for having the spunk to overcome all of the problems life has thrown at her and making a better life for herself, while I feel sorry for Rhonda.  Another character that I truly admire is Elijah who is a substitute father for the girls and their saving grace also.<br />This book really started out slow but picks up in the middle.  I highly recommend reading this book.	2001-06-04

Our unnamed hero is virtually thrown into bondage after painting a fence for the campground owner where he was supposed to be on Holiday.  He is given more odd jobs by his landlord and is eventually roped into doing his daughters homework.  He plays darts at the pub and is on and off the dart team at will.  The town locals extend credit to him but his landlord never makes any mention to his wages.  He eventually takes over the milk route after the death of the current milkman and nobody seems to question the circumstances of the milkman's death.  I have many unanswered questions about this book and the ending but I do recommend reading it.	2001-02-19

Ruth is dying from Breast Cancer and she is being taken care of by Ann and some of her other friends LD, Sarah, and Helen.  I really liked the character of LD who wouldn't give up hope until the end no matter how much they told her that Ruth's death was inevitable.  But the best part of the story is the friendship shared between Ruth and Ann, a friendship that strong is very rare to find today.  I truly enjoyed reading this book and has to be one of Ms. Berg's best.	2001-02-17
US	47641197	R1ZHDM4GMF29U8	0515119784	417080124	Range of Motion	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Highly Recommend	In this book the main character Lainey Berman has to deal with life after her husband was in a freak accident that has left him in a coma.  I was able to feel the devotion that she had towards her Husband with all of her attemps to have him come out of it.  I didn't feel Alice's marital problems or the &quot;Ghost Woman&quot; was a necessary part of the story.  I would have much rather have Alice help Lainey through her problems instead of the hallucination.  Even though I disagree with these parts of the story, I would highly recommend reading this book.	2001-02-06

During this trip Mrs. Kuzo thinks back to her tragic life with her dysfunctional family, but I was amazed how the author was able to add some humor to the tragic details.  I would highly recommend reading this book.	2001-01-30

I would highly recommend this book.	2001-01-21

I believed what happened to Alice could happen to anyone, yes she should have been watching the girls more closely but it was an accident.  What surprised me was the way Theresa was able to forgive her that soon.  Alice was her own worst enemy in this story, but I think it was important to the story to show that Alice was not just a goody two shoes that was wrongfully accused of Sexual Abuse. The descriptions of someone going through a nervous breakdown and the ordeal in jail were well written and I would recommend reading this book.	2001-01-12

She is staying in the home of her Son Alan eventhough these two have had their differences in the past. I was not able to connect with any of these characters and found this book kind of uninteresting and I spent a longer time than usual to finish. I found this book a true dissapointment because I usually enjoy reading Sue Miller's books. My recomendation is to read &quot;The Good Mother&quot; instead.	2000-12-26

Ruth was a character I was able to sympathize with because of her treatment by May and others who labeled her as slow, but at the same time I was able to admire her ability to be a survivor thoughtout her tormented life and the shocking ending.  I have not read any other books by Jane Hamilton but after enjoying this book so much, that will soon change.  I highly recommend reading &quot;The Book of Ruth&quot;	2000-12-06
