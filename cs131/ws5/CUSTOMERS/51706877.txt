Okay, so we've read \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and now we all have to get a copy of this book so we can be introduced to Robert Langdon and find out all about him.  As in \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", Dan Brown is obviously a man who does his research before applying it to paper.  Everything he wrote in this book is factual, with the exception of antimatter being that's in a state of scientific development.  However, I did not find this book to be as exciting as the sequel.  In fact, it lost steam before the last sixty or so pages after the crisis was taken care of.  And, it leaves some loose ends with the villain's fate being a mystery.   <br /> <br /> <br />In all, the only reason this book is selling so well is because of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\".  If it weren't for that book, \\"Angels & Demons\\" would be a book no one out there would even care about.  Still, pretty goo. <br />	2005-06-24

I watch \\"One Life To Live\\" each day and bought this book just like any fan of the show.  What a waste of time and money I spent on this.  Where was the action?  Where was the suspense?  I thought there were too many characters to keep up with, and the ones they had did not interest me in the slightest.  A few mysteries were solved, including discovering who the actual villain was.  But, it's not worth wasting your time and money over.  If you've watched OLTL and have seen how people in the Love Center group have been killed, or have seen how someone attempted to kill others, then you know the entire book.  Don't bother.	2005-05-31

Being William Shatner's books have started to weaken, I didn't want to chance owning a copy of this.  The CD I will probably get the next time I take a road trip.  Then again, it was so boring that having a CD may prove dangerous.<br />At any rate, this was not great reading.  It was wonderful when Kirk was brought back through Borg technology and then it was good when the mirror universe visited our universe.  But, what was the point of this story?  It all takes place on Bajor, not once on the Enterprise.  Then, after Picard is lost, Kirk is helpless to do anything.  What about Deep Space Nine floating nearby?  Nobody thinks of calling the station for help.  Then again, conveniently, nobody goes camping with any communication devices in this either.<br />Now, the time Kirk remembers being on his Enterprise was a nice story.  But, that story is only told to set up the events that will take place in the next story called \\"Captain's Blood\\".  At least, in the end, we finally find out what happened to the Monitor and Captain Lewinski.  Plus, it briefly explains what happened to the robot ship the Federation was sending to Kelva in \\"By Any Other Name\\".<br />But, when Kirk is busy searching for Picard and dealing with the Bajorans, it really gets boring.  There is no adventure and no interest at all.  So, my advice is if you're going to read it, go to your local library. Take the book off the shelf, read it for an hour or so, write down what page you're on when you leave, then continue on that page the next time you go in there!   Not worth the money.  Believe me.	2002-11-13

When I first picked up this book, I thought it was another story about a car that goes wild, killing anyone that gets in its way.  I can tell I was wrong there.  This book is an OK read.  It was not one that I had trouble putting down though.  I would read it, then not pick it up again for a day or two.  I must say the front cover looks menacing though.  It makes the car look as if it has an actual face on it and it's ready to eat someone.<br />This book does not resolve all the issues either.  People disappear without a trace, and you would think we would find out where they went.  Plus, I was waiting for the car's owner to appear again, maybe explain what all of this was about.  Not a chance.  So, in all, we never really find out where this car came from, who owned it, nothing.  It just sits in a shed forever creating light shows and spewing out creatures from another world.  With all that happens, the burning question is this:  Why don't they blow up this car or take it to a junkyard and destroy it?   Why would a town hold on to something they know is dangerous?<br />In any case, I'm sorry to say that this book is not the way for Stephen King to retire.  If he's going to retire with one last novel, it should be something that goes out with a bang, not a fizzle.	2002-10-09

However, again, Clancy could have written either a shorter book by eliminating things about the characters that we did not care about, or he could have written more to the story to make it more interesting.  Clancy probably made this one as short as it was because of the past remarks people have made about his book, saying he inserts things that have nothing to do with the story.<BR>This time, I completely understood the story even with the background on the characters.  That's what made me stay interested in it.  But, I do have the feeling he is running out of ideas and that is why he wrote this story occuring before &quot;Clear And Present Danger&quot;, and long before Jack Ryan becomes POTUS.  There just are not too many more ideas you can have these days with recurring characters.<br />I hate to say this, but I think Tom Clancy needs to write one more, perhaps at the end of the presidency, or maybe at election time, but making sure Ryan is not reelected.	2002-09-12

I just bought this book a week ago and read it in two days.  Now that Game Show Network has brought the show back, it's nice to also read about it.  Peter Marshall has written a book not about his life, but his time on &quot;The Hollywood Squares&quot;.  He talks about what life was like with Paul Lynde, Rose-Marie, George Gobel and many others that I loved as a kid watching the show.  <br />I gave this five stars because of the book.  It also includes a wonderful CD with the zingers that we all loved to hear after a question was asked.  The only drawback on this CD is hearing Buddy Hackett's laugh for much of the CD, and it's always the same laugh!  It's irritating to listen to, but I can get past that.  <br />The book answers many questions and gives many secrets of what went on in the heyday of this show.  I won't spoil it for others, but it has information on the recently discovered thought to be destroyed episodes that GSN now airs.  Plus, you can read about stars of today who were contestants on the show.  One secret I'll give away is the fact that Naomi Judd was once a contestant!<br />Buy this book today.

I've been used to nothing but law dramas over the years from him, but this one really was different.  It reminded me of &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; in one way, but with Mexicans being the prejudiced enemy here.  Also, it must be overwhelming to a seven year old, like the narrator here, to witnesses the events that occur and then not be able to share them.  I won't give away the story to those who haven't read it, but it will excite you.<br />I recommend this book to anyone that likes a good story.  It does slow down at times, with little action, but the story will keep you interested nonetheless.  Buy it today!  Read it today!	2001-05-08

I picked this book up in August of 2000 but didn't really get around to reading it until recently.  <br />Tom Clancy could make this, and many previous books, much better if he would trim a few hundred pages of nonsense the reader isn't interested in as well as the techincal gobble-de-gook most readers don't undertstand, unless you're in the armed forces.<br />However, toward the end, it does get exciting.  I won't spoil it for those who haven't read it yet, but I thought for sure a nuclear war was going to erupt.  It probably still will in the future books to come.<br />I will say this though.  Are we really expected to believe that after everything that occured, the United States in real life would just say &quot;Oh, forget about it&quot; to another country that nearly blew up a major city of ours?  I think not.<br />Tom, I'm sorry, but I think it's getting to be time to either kill off Jack Ryan, or retire him.  He was a much better man when he was still in the CIA.  Being POTUS doesn't give him much freedom, as we discover in this story.	2001-04-18

The excitement never comes to an end, plus so much happens in it that there's a need for a second book.  This one starts out with planets being endangered and the Federation coming to the rescue, when possible.  You never do find out who the villain is, but I'm sure that's being saved for the next book in April.  It was hard to put down for these reasons.<br />This book answers many questions about what happened to Genesis and Carol Marcus after the second &quot;Trek&quot; film as well.  Although many critics say that the books contain events that never actually happened, this book in still entertaining.  I can't wait until April when the second book is out.  My only reservation is that sequels usually don't live up to the original, but we'll see.	2000-10-12

However, it also outdates and tells a different story of the man we see in &quot;First Contact&quot;.  World War III occurs somewhere in the 2040's or 2050's, yet this book says it happens much later on,  somewhere between 2078 and 2117.  2030 is the year it says Cochrane was born, yet in &quot;First Contact&quot;, when Picard and crew go back in time to stop the Borg, it is 2063, making Cochrane only thirty-three years old.  He looks much older, unless time hasn't been a great &quot;companion&quot;.  Sorry about the pun.<br />This was a great story when it came out in 1994, but it is now a different story.  Doesn't Paramount look at these books and the stories in them before making a movie telling a different story?  The same discrepancies occur in &quot;Strangers From The Sky&quot; and &quot;Dark Mirror&quot;.  Read those if you don't know what I'm talking about.	2000-09-28

I got into it immediately when the  story of the Valiant crew was told.  After that, I thought it was a bit  bizarre.  I know science fiction is like that, but what was really  disappointing was the fact that no one gets to see what the Nuyyad look  like.  Not even a description in the book tells us, and no one even opens a  hailing frequency with them.  We just blow them up.  Having a Kelvan on  board made it interesting though.  At least Picard's mind was still there  on the Stargazer when he made the recommendation that Starfleet not have  contact with the Kelvans because of their inability to be trusted.<br />Of  course, having read &quot;Reunion&quot; ten years ago, it's hard to  comprehend the fact that everyone is an ally on this ship, including the  one person that ends up being a killer in that book.  (Sorry, you'll have  to read it to find out who it is).<br />In all, this book opens the  possibility of Michael Jan Friedman writing more books on the Stargazer  crew.  Let's keep our fingers crossed.	2000-09-13

I normally read things from science fiction, or things from the current  era we live in.  Just recently I saw &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; being voted  as one of the best books of the 20th century and decided to read it.  I  could not put it down.  It did take me forever to read (being that I do  have a job and a life), but I was really able to get into it over the  summer when I went on vacation for two weeks.  It just kept getting more  and more interesting.  This story has it all:  Adultery, sex, family  quarrels, competition, and, of course, the steel industry.  And once  someone has read this book, they'll forever know who John Galt really is.  This is the only Ayn Rand book I have read so far, but I intend to read the  rest of her works later on.  She may have written few novels, but she knew  what she was writing.  She had a gift for writing.  If there's a book  you're really looking for to read out there, this is the one I recommend to  everyone.	2000-09-10

Well, all of the answers are there to the questions I had asked earlier in the previous two books.  This was a great read, and much better than the last two.  I won't spoil the ending for those who have not read it yet, but  it's a little sad at the end, plus it leaves the door open for more books!   So, how will Kirk finally meet his fate?  Hopefully we'll find out soon.   And one other thing.  Will there be some story out of all of this saying  what happens to McCoy?  Being that it is now impossible for him to do any  guest appearances on any incarnation of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, shouldn't  some story be written on him?  (May he rest in peace).<br />Remember, read the  first five book before reading this one.  Great stuff.	2000-07-15

I haven't finished it yet, but I found the conversation Jack Crusher has with  Tuvok a bit disturbing when they talk about having families aboard ship.   Jack talks about the Stargazer separating into two parts in case enemies  are lurking about.  However, in Friedman's Reunion from 1990, it is  mentioned that the Stargazer can't separate like the Enterprise.  Why is  Michael Jan Friedman contradicting one of his own books?	2000-01-20

Peter David is my all-time favorite &quot;Star Trek&quot; author, but this time he has a story that ranks under what I'm used to rating him on.  And, I think it has to do with Peter collaborating with another person, a person  who has no prior experience in writing, as far as I know.  Peter David  needs to write his books like he always has...alone!  Keep John de Lancie  out of it.<br />I had trouble actually understanding what was going on.  Yes,  I know Lady Q and little q disappear, making much of the story Q's quest to  find them, but what was the rest of this story about?  Picard coming to  grips with his Locutus character was one thing, Q meeting up with the M  Continuum was another, but where did all of this come into the end of the  universe?<br />In all, this is a bit of a disappointment.  It's more like John  de Lancie did the writing, and Peter David only supervised some, if at all.   As I said, Peter David needs to write his stories his way.	1999-09-16

This novel is all right, but it's a story that would have been fine for Picard and crew to handle.  True, it gives us a chance to learn that Kirk was not killed at the end of &quot;The Return&quot;, but there just isn't  the excitement and suspense as there was in &quot;The Return&quot;.   However, if you are going to continue with the other reads after this one,  such as &quot;Spectre&quot; and &quot;Dark Victory&quot;, then you'll need  to read this one to understand how Kirk is resurrected again.<br />Otherwise,  a rather weak entry into Shatner's trilogy.	1999-08-02

The people in the mirror universe are extememly savage and brutal.  One part of the story occurs on  the prison asteroid.  Although it is never confirmed in the story, it is  rumored that the broth the prisoners consume on that asteroid is made from  the prisoners themselves.  Has Shatner been renting &quot;Soylent  Green&quot; from his local video store?<br />What they don't put on television  or even in the motion pictures is certainly available in this book.  Being  that the mirror universe episode was always my favorite, this is a must  read!  There is one problem.  If anyone read &quot;Dark Mirror&quot; by  Diane Duane, it states Spock was executed for treason.  However, in  Shatner's story, he's alive and well.  Why can't Pocket Books ever get the  stories straight?  I know &quot;Dark Mirror&quot; was written before DS9  aired the mirror universe episodes.  I just wanted to point it out anyway.	1999-08-02

All right, so Kirk's evil alter ego is alive and well in the mirror universe.  Yes, the book somewhat focuses on this, but we hardly ever hear from him.  Unless I missed something, this story never does explain how  Tiberius returned from the dead.  Did he also get sucked into a temporal  nexus.  If so, did a generous and warm hearted mirror Picard also get  sucked into the nexus after trying to stop an evil man from blowing up a  planet?  I don't think so.  As evil as the mirror universe counterparts  are, this seems unlikely.  The mirror Picard may have found a way to get  into the nexus there, grab the evil Tiberius, then escape, but nothing says  this.<br />Perhaps all of this will be explained next year when Shatner comes  out with &quot;Preserver&quot;.  Until then, we'll just have to  wonder.<br />This book was OK, but it's starting to go down hill some.  It's  getting to where Shatner needs to wrap it up.  Enough is enough.

I really thought it was a clever idea to resurrect Kirk in the way Shatner did.  The story keeps you guessing the entire time and keeps you not wanting to put the book down.  At the end of the story,  when Kirk throws the switch, I figured that was the end, being that he was  killed off anyway at the end of &quot;Generations&quot;.  Then, a year  later when advertisements came out for &quot;Avenger&quot;, I knew there  had to be some way Kirk survives.<br />A great read for any fan.  You don't  even have to have read &quot;Ashes of Eden&quot; to understand this story,  but I would still recommend reading it if you want to read all five of his  novels.

It took forever  and that's when I later heard about the problems Margaret was having in her  original story.  Also, the rumor was that this story was going to  contradict the events in &quot;Star Trek VI&quot; so it had to be  postponed.  I don't see why Paramount can't just get together with the  authors first and come to a conclusion or agreement.<br />I loved the comment  one reader made.

Peter  David normally writes things I have trouble putting down, but this one was  a bit of a disappointment.  An interesting read, but only average.

It ties in a hole in between the end of &quot;Star Trek VI&quot; and &quot;Generations&quot;.  At least we get to find out what happens to the Enterprise before the new ship is launched.  Also, it's a  great love story for Kirk with entanglements from the Federation  bureaucrats involved in the story.<br />There is one problem though.  One  thing he writes about contradicts another book called &quot;Sarek&quot;  which was written by A.C. Crispin.  That story occurred after &quot;Star  Trek VI&quot;.  The Enterprise had been repaired of all battle damage at  the Vulcan spacedock (the damage inflicted by Chang and the other  Klingons).  In Shatner's story, the Enterprise is in mothballs, Kirk gets  it back from Teilani, but the ship still bears the battle damage by Chang's  photon torpedoes.<br />Enough nitpicking.  The story is a good start to the  many sequels Shatner would write later.  Not the best in the series, but  quite good.	1999-08-01

In Duane's novel, the Romulans were wiped out, and the Klingons were still alive but conquered by  the Empire.  On DS9, the Klingons and Cardassians are somewhat allies.   <br />This book was great, but it seems to be that if you have die hard fans  reading the novels, why can't the television episodes relating to the same  subject be alike?  The way I see it, Diane Duane first thought of a sequel  to the &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot; episode on the original series.	1999-08-01

When this novel first came out a few years ago, I thought it would be something like Q-In-Law.  I was not expecting anything like this.  I even have the audio version of this book  and have listened to it over and over again.  Being that they have not made  any &quot;Q&quot; motion pictures, this would have been a great one.<br />It  was rather amazing how Q managed to be the one that saved the Enterprise  from Trelane's wrath.  I thought for sure that the crew was finished with  the mean, horrible things Trelane does to them.  He was rather awful on TOS  episode &quot;The Squire of Gothos&quot;, but cruel and nasty in this  book.<br />Kudos to Peter David!	1999-08-01
