Not only it offers sufficient twist and suspense to the end of the book, the characterization, humour, romance are perfectly blended in a page turner.  It is sometimes shock, sometimes hilarious, sometimes violent and sometimes sexy.  Absolutely highly recommended and one of the best in the genre. <br />I am now having a new series of books waiting for me to read, together with Alex Cross and Lincoln Rhyme and Harry Bosch series.	2005-09-18

I pick this as the first book because of its size, a bit longer than 200 pages, so that I can finish it in 2 days.  <BR>I must say I am disappointed (not a bit, but quite a lot).  Not only the plot was HIGHLY predictable, I don't think it is good on character development.  <BR>In Hong Kong, such similar themes have been repeated in the movies in the 50-60s .   About 10 years ago, we had a movie called &quot;C'est La Vie Mon Cherie&quot; with similar theme, but with a much much much moving plot, much much much better characters. The female lead earned a best female actress award in the HK Movie Acadamy Award.  <BR> <BR>I know this review may piss some of the fans of the author, but I will keep on reading one or two more of his books to see whether I can change my mind.	2004-07-16

It strikes a good balance between a mere book of giving skin deep introductory knowledge of game theory, and a book with too much technical stuff (esp. mathematical proof).  The author made a good job almost like Stephen Hawking and Richard Feyman to explain difficult thing with an easy and friendly way.  What's more, the author included also many varies paradoxes, theroms from many great leaders in the game theory's field.  In beginning of each chapter, the author listed some questions for the reader to think about, before moving forward.  I must say this is a very good book for those who are not very sophisticated and advance in mathematics, or as a very first entry for anyone who wants to pursuit and learn game theory.	2004-07-16

As the title says, it is totally about Roland, the last gunslinger, to draw three foes which will be importantly involved in his search for the Dark Tower.  These three have been mentioned in the last chapter in the Gunslinger Volume One.  The story about each of the three is so interesting that it really gives you an eye-popping experience along your reading.  You will just never know where or how the story will be ending up.  The pace of this volume is also more fast and easy-to-follow than the first volume, making you unstoppable to read Volume Three The Waster Land immediately.  <BR>No one can create such a mesmerize story better than Stephen King, and he really is a master.	2004-03-22

Partly because they are several stories published in various magazines, partly because they were written before Mr. King was a more veteran author (that doesn't mean the stories are bad, they are just 'different' in style from the rest).  To me, the rest of the volumes (i.e. from the Drawing of Three onwards) are much better in terms of creativity, imagination, surprise, intense moment, etc.... which makes this volume one a little bit like a prelude.  <br />However, one cannot simply miss this entry, or without reading it before reading other volumes.  First, it gives some important events and history of Roland, the Gunslinger.  Also as a 'constant reader' of Mr. King, you can compare his writing skills and styles during these years.  Finally, as Mr. King himself ambitiously says he wants to write a longest epic story in American history.  Whether it can be as popular as Lord of the Ring, we need time to prove it.  But definitely, he is successful in producing an interesting and absorbing story, and obviously the longest one in our history.	2004-03-19

But it only concentrate on 2 main topics - setting up goals and picking up mutual funds. On goal setting, it is one of a few books that give such an emphasis (and proportion) on this topic.  It is important, critical, but somewhat over-long.  (Imagine listing several pages of places/events that help you to pick up for your goal?)  The good side is that the importance of goal setting is applicable is many other areas - not just personal finance.  The second half of the book is about mutual funds, and there are some very interesting 'facts' - e.g. Morning Star ratings, index fund, tax benefit, etc.  Since the author is quite humorous, it is a very easy read for the 300+ pages.  One thing I only like is that some of the footnotes are totally pointless - they are there just for the sake of being funny??  Maybe Ric can consider 2 labelling of footnotes - one is useful and the other is only joke.	2004-03-16

As a veteran fan of Alex Cross, and after reading more than once for each entry in the whole series, I must say that Violets Are Blue are quite unique in several ways.<BR>First, the focus on vampire-like murders make me feel like reading a crossover with X-file/Buffy.  Second, Cross and Jamila weres in many moments too close to Mastermind that you would really feel worry about them.  Third, the ending is a real twist and it makes me unstoppable to turn the pages to know what will happen.  Finally, this entry almost signify the end of Cross's life in Washington PD migrating to FBI.  <br />Another good thing about Cross series is that, once you are hooked to them, the characters (Nana, Sampson, Christine, Jamila, ...... are just so real that they all like part of your life)	2004-01-28

Together with the typical flaw like many of Grisham's novel - sudden and bad ending, this certainly is just a so-so novel from Grisham.

With some what higher expectation, this book does not disappointed me at all.<br />This proves Dan to be a top writer in several ways:<br />- this is an easy to read book.  The major two plots - the war about the next president between two characters, and the certifying of a meteorite in Artic by 4 civilian experts, interweave closely and parallelly throughout the book.  There are many characters involved but with such a good writing skill by Mr. Brown, the characters are clearly developed, and background histories are disclosed in detail.  The reader will never get lost in the complex and air-tight story.<br />- it blends (successfully) both political conspiracy story and scientific story together, and with a very good success.  The war between President Herney and Senator Sexton is not complicate, but sure full of twists and surprises.  You will never know who's the winner until the very end.  On the scientic discovery of the meteorite, it is just like reading a Crichton book that is full of interesting theories and knowledges.  To a lessor extent, there are also love and action elements, making this a very entertaining book to read.<br />I will definitely add Dan Brown on my \\"must read\\" list.	2003-08-18

But no, indeed I was surpised that those five patients are only mentioned in 1/5 of the book.  The rest 4/5 of the book are talking about everything about hospital - its history, budget, organizational structure, politics, teaching versus community hospital, surgeon, urine, anaesthesia.....  <br />I find most of these medical topics are interesting, though some are somewhat outdated.  Also, I admire Mr. Crichton's writing skill to interweave these different topics together in a 200-page book.  <br />My recommedation - do not treat it as a fiction.

Some books can be classfied as a classic while some are just junks.  However, I would say in general Alex Cross series is better-than-average.  Along Came a Spider gives you an eye-opening experience in 2 1/2 page per chapter, ultra-high paced, double narrative style of writing a truly complicated and good thriller.  Kiss the Girl sublimated to another level - more effort to character development.  Nana, Alex, Kate or Casanova.<br />But in Roses Are Red, the shortest of all Alex series, is just soooo flat..yes it has several twists, but it is just like watching a B-grade slasher thriller.  After reading it, I truly believe Mr. Paterson was writing in a hurry, without too much preparation to weave a more complicated plot, or he can't wait to earn money from the Alex Cross fans.  <br />The only thing that moved and touched me about this novel was the saddness torturing Alex - about his daughter, Christine, .....	2003-02-17

This book maintains all the elements or a good fast thriller - distinguishable characters, tight plot, unexpected twisted, that will keep you to flip the book like crazy.  But this one lacks the tightly woven complicated plot as in Bone Collector, or the much further character development (for Lincoln and Amelia I am refering to) as in Coffin Dancer.  <BR>Some reviewers argued that in the beginning, you have already known who the killer was.  But if you are a veteran Deavers fan, you should know that Mr. Deaver will keep giving you surprises in his books.  In fact, I think because I have become used to expect the unexpected, so that soft some of the excitement in reading his books lately.  But there is seldom any author nowadays that can create such tension as Mr. Deaver does, so I still recommend this as to all thriller lovers.	2003-02-17

So I bought all of Connelly's book.  I then read the Harry Bosch series, started with Black Echo, then Black Ice.  Now I just finished Concrete Blonde.<br />Harry Bosch is not a distinctive and outstanding hero in terms of his character - as compared with Lincoln Rhyme (Bone Collector) and Alex Cross (Along Came a Spider) or Stephanie Plum. I would to say he is just like a character that like Kay Scarpetta, once you read more him, you will go on to find out what's happening to him.<br />But don't get me wrong, Connelly is a good author that he slowly builds Harry's background and the interest to find out more about him is greater than other characters.

In Concrete Blonde, the Dollmaker case is finally described in fine details (great!!), and the murder of Harry's mother is mentioned.  So obviously I will continue with Last Coyote to find out that murder.  Mr. Connelly has done a great job to create such a character with great skill.  <br />Actually, I didn't plan to read Concrete Blonde just after I've finished with Black Ice.  But I've read the excerpt at the back, and I was immediately attracted by the plot and determined to read this 3rd Harry entry.  <br />It didn't disappointed me.  First, about the Dollmaker case.  Second, the courtroom drama.  Many (non-legal thriller) authors has added some drama scene in their books - James Paterson in Pop Goes to Weasel, Sidney Sheldon in The Other Side of Midnight, but NONE of them write as good as Connelly (though I think Scott Turrow and Richard North Patterson are a little bit better - but they are laywers!!).  Third, I love Sylvia very much, itis very interesting to see what's happening to her relationship with Harry.  <br />In summary - I love this book, but I find Connelly can have better ones (e.g. Blood Work), so I rank this at 3-star, meaning better than average and recommended for you to read.	2002-12-31

Weasel is cunning but is not as sick, devilish or gruesome as Gary Soneji or Casanova.  <br />Anyway, I think Pop Goes to Weasel is a book that once you are a fan of Alex Cross, you will look read it by all means.	2001-10-03

If I wrote a review right after that, I would have say something different.<br />Yesterday, when I was watching the collapsing of WTC, I kept remembering the plot of this novel.  It is so shock and sad that terrorism really happen in it fullest.<br />May God bless all the victim and their families.	2001-09-12

The rests are just OK.  This is no exception.  Well, it is definitely a page-turner, but in terms of plot, twist, violence, .... all those elements in the Cross series,  I just cannot find enough of them here.   One interesting opinion, I find this book much alike Dean Kootnz's style - a troubled heroine, getting romance with our hero, sci-fi experiments, government pursuit.....if not on the snappy 2 1/2 page chapter style, I really will think this is a Dean Kootnz book.	2001-08-10

Not only it describes the dirty tricks used by the cigarette companies, it also puts the focus on the jurors themselves.  It is not a normal courtroom  novel that flows around the lawyers or prosecutors.  You will rethink that  juror is also important during a verdict. A totally new experience, and  completely satifactory reading.	2000-04-14
