US	49629036	R29ZBDUZBSKCSX	0393321975	588164356	A Suspension of Mercy	Books	5	7	9	N	N	A mystery story without a real murder	During the whole book one of the main figures, Sydney, thinks about killing other people. Of course, he's a writer he has to imagine such things, other people in the story say. Nearly in every detail he imagines how he would kill for example his wife. And when she leaves him he plays as if she was really dead and it seems as if she was on the way to play this game with him. But his wife isn't dead. She's still alive but she doesn't want to see Sydney again and she doesn't want to come back to her parents because she's ashamed because she has been away for such a long time.  <br />But didn't I buy a mystery story the reader asks himself. He can see that there's a lot of talking about murder but no-one gets killed by an other. Still the book takes an ending in a very special way, in a way no-one would expect it to happen. <br />So we may say that Patricia Highsmith keeps us on tenterhooks nearly until the end of the book - because we are all waiting for a murder and really don't know if it will happen. And we can also never be sure, that the murder (if it is going to happen) will happen in the way we could imagine it. We are always uncertain about the next thing that will happen. But exactly this is how Patricia Highsmith holds the tension inside of us high, very high.  <br />I really enjoyed this book because it's full of tension from the first until the last page and you as the reader may never know what will happen next. The book is also full of special personalities who are worth to be  known by us. The figures have thoughts which I can't imagine that they will cross my mind once but it's very interesting to see how other people may think or react if the situation becomes real or seems to become real. <br />The book really takes us in another world, a world full of incertitudes although the reader does always know what Sydney thinks. But there are all the other people who think differently about Sydney and this always produces a feeling of incertitude in us. The reader doesn't really know if he may trust Sydney or if Sydney will do a thing to change the image we have of him. This also holds the tension on a very high level. Your feelings will change through the lecture at the end of the book you will think differently about nearly everyone in the book than you did in the beginning! So, just read it and let you be taken through this change of feelings! <br />	2004-11-22

They wouldn't be mentioned in other texts. Further on I liked the metaphors the author uses a lot! How she's able to compare situations with other situations, so that in the end it's very clear what she would like to say. <br />Also the characters are very unusual: You know what they are thinking, the reader even hears the words of a song that they are humming. Or another example: you read the same thing that the twins do, when they read something backwards. Because of things like that you are as close as possible to the people and I can't remember a book I read where I was closer to the main characters. <br />On the other hand it's very interesting how Roy narrates a family story but at the same time there's the political story of India coming out in the background. <br />	2004-11-22

I've heard a lot about Patricia Highsmith before and I also saw the movie The Talented Mr.Ripley. I found it really strange, but I knew that this author wrote a lot of books with strange personalities in there. Now I've read a book from her and I only can say that I founded amazing. In the story you know from the beginning that this the two guys will kill somebody, but the interesting thing is not to know who killed, but why they kill and how the become killers. The whole tells about 300 pages why the become killers. I think Patricia Highsmith would say: \\"You and me can become killer, everyone has a part inside who can kill somebody.\\" What a strange view of the human being. Read the book!	2004-06-22

It has a lot of crazy things in it and the main person is a real psychopath but I guess that's what makes the book so special. I like the idea that someone has an obsession and all he wants is to realize it. On the other hand I don't like the end of the novel too much since we don't know at all what will happen to Anne.

It's not like a usual book, where the good guys fight the bad guys and at the end the good guys win. No, not at all, you can identify yourself with Mr. Ripley, who is a murderer. That's what makes this book so special. You accompany Mr. Ripley through the whole story and feel as if you were on his side! The special thing is, that you do not accompany just one person, but two of them. Well, two different characters, but the same person. It's always amusing how he changes from the one to the other identity and has to hide his other side from other people. He lies all the time to get away and plays the unknowing tourist. All these things make this book rather thrilling though the story line is always the same.<BR>I guess it's quite interesting to read such a book once, but you can't always read the same thing, it also gets kind of boring after a while.	2004-06-17

Every time you get tired of reading you'd like to go on because of the tension in the text. I truly can say that this book is one of my favourites. At first you have to get to know a lot of things, but after a certain time they all fit together, like a puzzle. The characters are deeply described, you get to know Chester and Rydal up close and personal. There are two faces of January and two faces of Rydal and Chester. <BR>There is just one thing I didn't like very much: after Colette died things got easily forseenable. I already knew the end of the book before I had read it. But after all I recommend this book. But you will only read it once, because the story is quite simple at the end. Like every crime story this book lives of the tension.	2004-06-16

I think the story has something very extravagant and is, psychologically seen, such a great work of art. The story is interesting because of the variability of the different people. The different characters are well constructed but in a way not as realistic as in the book.<br />Tom Ripley is a man with too high ambitions but he can't  realise his dreams so easily in this world.<br />I think the aspect of seeing through the eyes of the protagonist is nothing special but through the eyes of a criminal. It's very interesting and a great challenge not to lose sight of the right side of life and the importance of the relations between important and true friends. In a way the story aims at the global world constellation because of the relations among the various points of power in the world, like the \\"good\\" and the \\"bad\\" people or the way how you succeed in your life.<br />But altogether it's a thrilling story which I can recommend to read.	2004-06-15

The story is about some murder that a Jonathan Travanny, a man with a blood disease, has to do. A man called Reeves gave the order. First Trevanny does the job alone, but by the following murders Ripley helps him. Ripley and Trevanny almost become friends, but Trevanny's wife doesn't like Ripley and she doesn't know that her husband is a murderer. But in fact Jonathan Trevanny did the job only to earn some money for his wife and his son Georges because he is fatally ill and does not expect to live much longer. At the end Trevanny dies because he is hit by a bullet from a Mafioso.<BR>The sentences are very easy, and there aren't a lot of difficult words.

The past of Rydal Keener is an important and interesting fact in the story and it's always behind the story and has a great influence. <BR>The most interesting part is of course the little love story between Rydal and Colette and the reactions of Chester. Chester depends on Rydal, because he does not have any connections in Greece, but he loves his wife too and has to see to it that Rydal does not sleep with her. The tension is that I always wait for a reaction of Chester's and the lack of knowledge about the next step of Colette and Rydal.<BR>When Colette dies, the tension is gone. It's just a normal crime with a bad and a good guy. For me it was a bit unrealistic, nobody would travel with a murderer on the same ship, who hates you and wants to kill you.<BR>The end is not really interesting, the bad guy dies and the good guy has no problems anymore. Rydal escape from his problems too easily.<BR>At last the beginning of the story is absolutely great, but the end is for me a bit unrealistic and it is not so thrilling as the first part of the story. <BR>But I must say that I do not often like the end of books or movies in general.	2004-06-15

But the end is not as simple as the beginning at all. Charles Bruno has killed Guy Haines' wife and Guy has killed Bruno's father. The basis for these two murders is established still on the train, but at that time no one imagines that it would go so far. Both have killed somebody at the end, but there is a difference between them: Bruno is an insane, and Guy is a victim.<BR>Through the whole story a very complex relationship between these two men evolves just because of this accidental meeting on the train. Patricia Highsmith shows her ability to describe such relationships in a wonderful way. She tells a whole story with a relationship and has no need of any kind of big surprise effects to turn around the whole story. The reader is always up-to-date concerning the main action. Although it's not boring at all, because the real tension of the story is not created by the progression of the actions but by the progression of the relationship.<BR>\\"Straingers on a Train\\" is not a typical detective story. Highsmith's protagonist is not a private detective who solves the case gloriously. The two murderers are protagonists, the reader even shares the suffering of the two men running away from the \\"bad\\" police. This complete role reversal - together with many other unusual initial positions - makes the book to a unique reading enjoyment. Absolutely recommendable!	2004-06-15

I've never heard a story like this, in which a young boy loves an older woman. And I was very interested in it. The first few pages were really good like the  fake suicides of Harold were funny and tragedy at the same time and Maude, too, was a special person I liked. But the longer I read on the more I was disappointed. The story was always funny, but at the beginning I thought the story had a real point. But in the middle of the book, I had my doubts. I've never heard from a woman like Maude, who is never upset. Only happy, the whole day. I think that would be really nice, but it's too unreal for me. The biggest disappointment came at the end, where Maude commits suicide. Maude, who told us all, that she loves life so much and that's a reason for all. For me, with this ending, the whole story is a pack of lies. I can't trust a  woman who says that and does the opportunity.<BR>My conclusion is that it's a very nice book. There is something to cry, something to laugh and something to think about. But I must say, I expected more. The idea is brilliant, but I didn't like the execution very much.	2003-12-09

It's a little bit short, but that is not really bad. Because of the shortness, the book can't become boring.<BR>I like that the story is mysterious. The attack from the birds is<BR>inexplicable.

The birds stand in this book for all nature disaster. It's just an other representation. I think it's a ingenious representaion.<BR>The book is timeless.

The story might be good but there are too many little details in it, which distract the reader from the main story. By-and-by I lost the thread and at the end it nearly became a torture to finish reading the book. If it hadn't had so many complicated trifles in it, it would indeed have been a well written story. Some 150 pages would do!	2003-06-16

Fowler and Pyle become friends, but then there is a problem. Pyle falls in love with Phuong and wants to marry her... <BR>The story contains interesting characters. It is the story about a friendship of two completely different men who love the same woman. <BR>First I didn't like to read the story, because it's a difficult language with all the special \\"war expressions\\".

One thing i should tell you if you consider to read &quot;The Power And The Glory&quot; by Graham Greene: This book is marvelous and if you start reading it in the evening, you will not cut until you have finished the book. The story is thrilling and exciting. It's amazing how you can tremble, run, fear with the priest. You can feel this urgency of not getting identified or caught by anyone. It is a bit difficult to read though, due to the marginal stories like the one of Mr. Tench. But still the main story is really challenging, it makes you humble before God, to whom still belongs all the power and the glory.	2003-06-16

He discribes the affair between Sarah and Bendrix in a way you can really imagine everything, you see how they love each other etc. Indeed you suffer with them while you are reading the book and you have to think about the whole story all the time. This might be so because the book is written in the 1st person, called Bendrix, so you can identify with him rather well.<BR>Although it's a sad book, I really like it and can recommend it.

It is very philosophical and makes you think about the moral question of what is right or wrong and also about honesty and cheating. The race that Smith loses on purpose at the end is very interesting, I always thought he would change his mind and win the race, when he was thinking about his father's death and the possibility to have a wife and children and a \\"honest\\" work. Sometimes I wished he would change his mind because he is an intelligent guy but most of time I think it's good that he goes his own way and doesn't do what other people want him to do.	2003-06-04

The situation of Nat and his family is shown well because you just see Nat's point of view and so you know how he sees that crazy situation of having millions of birds attack his family. You can feel the danger of the bird attacks and the fear and the helpness of the whole population. <BR>I think the story isn't very difficult to understand. It's written in an easy English. Alfred Hitchcock took the idea of the birds' attacks from Du Maurier and made a great film out of it. But the story is very different from the book - only the bird's attack ia still the same.	2003-06-04

He gives advice to the government. <BR>The book is different from the film, so don't expect the movie the same as the book. In the film Jack Ryan is much younger than in the book, that was actually a clever thing! Because a writer wants to sell his books, so it has to be entertaining and thrilling! <BR>And Tom Clancy is really a master of excitement, he knows how to entertain! That's why he's so famous and he earns so much money!<BR>The characters are quite colourless! You read 900 pages and you still not very much about a person! The plot is the important thing! So that's why he writes how the scientists rebuild the bomb, I mean, who wants to know?

The relationship between Marcus and Ellie is really cute and that's one thing that is missing in the movie. And when I thought about Will sitting in the SPAT group I almost cracked up.<BR>The ending is a little disappointing. I expected something greater than that.  Still I highly recommend the book!

It's a story about relationships and friendships, about very special ones. But during the whole reading I had the feeling the story hadn't begun yet, and when it was over I still had this feeling. The progress of the relationship between the main personalities, Marcus and Will, is not at an end, not at a point where it could stay. The tension is not solved. And exactly that is what I expect of a story. I want to have a completed story.<BR>Well, not all was bad naturally. The author created interesting personalities, really particular ones, but not altogether unreal ones. The reactions of the people in the story are always convincing. Sometimes it even seems to be a psychological study of a group of rather odd people on the fringe of society.<BR>For who is interested in personalities and not in action or great stories this book is worth reading.

Burgess imagined some really smart steps with which Alex tried this. On the other hand the book made me think about \\"friends\\". How many \\"friends\\" in this world are there like Alex's? Or the other way around: what did Alex do that his friends thought they were right to do such things? I mean they betrayed him as they broke into the house of the old lady with the cats. Of course Alex wasn't exactly right playing the leader of the gang without knowing that his friends don't absolutely agree with him. But is this really enough to betray him in such a way? Or is it just the character of his friends to act this way? Still, it made me also think about the way they wanted to cure the criminals. Is this really a reasonable way?	2003-06-02

Above all Jennifer, the young woman who falls in love and then dies so early. She always says what she thinks. She's a tough woman and although sometimes her honesty is hard, it makes her stand out as an extraordinary character. There's one comment from a reader written in a review about the novel saying the story was kitsch, which I don't share at all. The end is well done! It would have been  kitsch indeed if Jenny had been cured of her cancer in the last few pages. But this way the end is excellent, above all if you consider the reconciliation that takes place between Oliver and his Father. Oliver doesn't say it directly to his father that he loves him, but in a way everybody understands that they have somehow found each other again.	2003-06-02

There is a boy who's rebelling against society, whose representative is the governor of Borstal, the prison for young people who have all commit crimes. The story shows the real sense of honesty. What is honesty? To see the meaning of it with the eyes of this young boy can change our meaning about honesty. He wants to make us believe that we aren't honest to ourselves. The view of the world of this young boy shows what the circumstances we grew up in can really affect our lives and our attitude to society. Not everyone is bad! That's a message this boy doesn't know anything that. <BR>With this book you almost have a little guide book about how to behave in contact with young criminals, who behaved badly in society.

It is one of the best love stories I have come across. A perfect book to give someone special and a jewel to treasure for you. <BR>The story is about two young people who fall in love although they notice at first that they have hardly  anything in common. They have two very different characters, and their social background could not be farther apart. But at least they have found each other and they become happy. The relations between their parents are also very important in this book. The end of the story is hinted at in the very first sentence. So it's not a surprise what the end must be like.  However, after every page you have read you want to read on and that's something that makes a book really great I suppose. <BR>Besides the vocabulary is very well chosen!

The film is more a summary of the book. Forrest does a lot more things in the book, funny things. If you had seen the film before, and read the book after it, you don't think that it's the same story. The film is nearer the reality then the book. Because in the book there are more stupid activities of Forrest, for example the wrestling scene. But exactly those events make the book interesting!<br />The book is very interesting  to read. It's more a biography of Forrest. But there is always some action and it's never boring to read! It's quite a funny book, and sometimes you have to ask yourself, why Forrest is calling an \\"idiot\\", because he does a lot of things in his life what \\"normal\\" people never would do in their lives. For example he goes up to space, for a lot of people that'll be only a big dream in their whole life. Or another example is Forrest's shrimp-farm, he earned a lot of respect with it. So I'd rather call Forrest Gump a special genius. Of course no \\"normal genius like \\"Einstein\\" or so, but on one tour he is one.<br />The language in this book is not absolutely  school - English, it's more a dialect. But it's easy to understand this book. So I would recommend this book to you!	2003-05-16

But the book is also good for little children, because the fairy tales are written in a nice language. They are very pretty,  <BR>My favourite story in the book is The Selfish Giant\\".

So it's easy to understand. <BR>But I don't like the plot. The two topics are love and mistakes by taking someone for someone he isn't really. So that's very boring.

It's to kitschy and I hate kitschy stories. <BR>The person I like most is Feste, the clown. I knows all persons and is very intelligent, although all tell him his is only a fool.

But my prejudices were unfounded. Shakespeare's language is so adorable to read, with the steady rhythm it never gives up. His humor is amusing, funny and ambiguous. Everybody that loves puns, i.e. hisplays with words is the perfect reader for this comedy<BR>All his characters have a funny and a sad side beside. For example on the one hand the fool is really eloquent, but on the other hand he is a person nobody takes seriously. That makes him a fascinationg character for the reader to study. <BR>Still I think most characters are a little too exaggerated, which might be explained by the fact that the play was written four hundred years ago, and so people went to see it with another attitude.	2003-01-09

It was quite interesting to read it in this version, because you could compare the old English with the modern English. I have to say that the old English version was very difficult to understand and I was glad to have the modern English version beside.<BR>The book was sometimes funny to read, because the servants of the house do so many foolish pranks. The clown Feste made me laugh.<BR>The main plot is about Count Orsino's unreplied love to the rich lady Olivia. Viola, who thinks she has lost her twin brother on a ship, is disguised as a man and serves the count. She has to convince Viola of Orsino's love. But what else could happen than a mess? Viola falls in love with Orsino, and Olivia falls in love with Viola... After some funny troubles, Viola's brother comes back and Viola can show her love to Orsino, and Olivia comes together with Sebastian.<BR>I think it's a good story about love.	2003-01-09

Unfortunately we were rather in a hurry and so I had to read the play once again when I had time off to really understand the jokes and enjoy the play. I often heard people saying that Shakespeare liked intrigues and used to write funny and sometimes even a bit obscene and rough plays. I found that rumour confirmed while reading `Twelfth Night'. Nevertheless I liked the play and as our teacher procured a `side-by-side with modern English' version of the play the initially unfamiliar Elizabethan English wasn't a reason to despair. As for me, I can recommend the play to everybody who likes comedies which are not to superficial. Sir Toby and Malvolio  were surely my favourite characters. They are just killingly funny.	2003-01-09

All the characters are well set. What we liked most about the characters is that they are not individuals but they also represent stereotypes and everyone can identify himself with one of them. Our favourite is Sir Toby, not because of his drinking bouts but because he enjoys life so much and has a lot of funny ideas. <BR>On the left side the test is printed in old Shakespeare's English, on the right side in modern English; that makes it easy to understand the story and interesting to compare the two styles. <BR>We can recommend the book, especially as a class reader, because it's nice and interesting to replay parts of the play; we are write about our own experiences!	2003-01-09

The plot is a bit confusing at first but at least after Act Two everything clears up and you can really start just enjoying the book with all its action and (sometimes hidden) humorous situations and expressions.

I read the original edition but for me it was too hard to understand. This time, when I read 12th Night, it was totally different. Our teacher gave us the edition \\"Shakespeare Made Easy\\", and I really had fun to read it. But I am sure that it isn't only the easy language which I liked more, it is also the play 12th Night itself, which makes it more attractive than Romeo and Juliet. I didn't know that Shakespeare had so a great sense of humour. It  seems that all the actors are fools, and because of that, you like them all, even Malvolio, the villain of the play. For me it's the best English book I've ever red. I always had to laugh while I was reading it. I really recommend this book \\"Shakespeare Made Easy\\" because also those people who have some problems with the writing style of Shakespeare will learn to love his plays.	2003-01-09

I had never read Shakespeare before and I was really amazed about his writings. We read the book in modern English and it was easy to understand. I had my problems with the old English. I didn't understand very much but I think when you read Shakespeare you have to read it in English because the words are typical for his writings an it's only very Shakespeare in this \\"language\\". I like the action of the story. There are a lot of different characters (Viola, Orsino, Sir Toby, Maria and so on) and I think that makes the story interesting.  At the beginning I couldn't imagine what would happen. Towards the end I could but that was not so bad. Although I don't normally like stories where I can already say after reading a few pages what will eventually happen. The content of the story is funny. The part with Sir Toby, Sir Andrew, Fabian and Malvolio is the funniest part. How Malvolio speaks when he has found the letter is very amusing.. <BR>I am going to read another Shakespeare play again because I think he is such a good playwright. What I din't like in this book is the end because suddenly the whole story is over so fast and they married and that's it. That's one thing that bothered me.

It deals with an ordinary little town in the USA at the beginning of the last century. It describes  everyday life of normal people, their pleasures and their sorrows. This ordinary touch of the play makes it a bit difficult to see a message in the book at first sight. But at the end of the  play in the III Act I`ve found a interesting message: We spend and waste our time as though we had a million years to live and don't realize what life really is like!	2002-05-15

I think it's a little bit boring when the stage manager talks about the town on the stage. It's o.k. when he said two, three sentences but not page after page, like in act one. Wilder divides the play into three parts (daily life and birth, love and marriage, and death) and I think that these three stages in life are the most important factors in one's biography to make this whole play interesting. He discribes normal life very well. <BR>The 3rd act, where the dead talk together, is very special and I think that is one of the most interesting parts. I like it very much because I think it's something different to talk about. Why don't the living people heed their message?	2002-05-15

Strickland leaves his familiy to devote himself to painting. He goes to Paris, where he lives in poverty and does nothing but paint. He does not care about his fellow-painters and often offenses them in rather cruel ways. He's totally indifferent to any comfort and relationship. He finally dies on the island of Tahiti, where he had been married a second time. Maugham lets the narrator's character (which is omnipresent during every episode of Strickland's life) act in the background as to give more importance to the painter's action and generally to his own ideas. Nevertheless, I do not consider Strickland the most important thing in the novel, but his way of living, on one hand the &quot;prison&quot; of an artist, which is created by his own desire to do nothing but (in Strickland's case) paint - it's not an option, it's rather a compulsion. Maugham shows Stricklands indifference to everything and everyone very well and his desire to be like Gauguin seems obvious and very marked. In the end, Strickland dies and Maugham lets the reader feel that he was content and somehow fulfilled. I especially liked Maugham's description of Strickland's canvas on Tahiti. He lets the reader feel every perception he obviously felt observing his canvas... a wealth of observations.  What I didn't like was a part of Strickland's life in Paris where everything seemed a bit predictable.	2001-07-04

Also the way the characters of the women are described, disappointed me a bit, because it seems that they mostly live to serve men.  I was absolutely fascinated by the character of Strickland. Even if he seemed almost evil because of his indifference, there was something about him that made him mysterious. At the beginning you'd never guess what type of man Strickland really is, because he seems to be absolutely normal. I would have been glad, if he lived a bit longer in the book, because I wanted to know more about him. But perhaps it is exactly this that makes the story so interesting. Most of the information you need you get to know out of the dialogues between the narrator and somebody who knew Strickland and that makes him particularly mysterious. You learn a lot about art and artists and their way to live.  I can really recommend this book, it will not disappoint you!	2001-07-04

Not only Strickland himself, but also the other characters and their own little stories (for example Dirk Stroeve's) were really interesting. But the most interesting was of course Charles Strickland and his way from a stockbroker to an extremely creative but also obsessed artist. Maugham describes his character very accurately but not in a too detailed way. So the story is very fluent and never boring. Besides that, the language level of the story is, I think, quite high and so the book demands some reading skills as long as you are not a native speaker and is not just a nice, simple story about a famous artist. I also liked very much that I as a reader was like travelling with the author and could always find out new things about Strickland's life.	2001-07-02

Maugham tells the story of anbusiness and family man called Strickland who is obsessed by art and who decides to become a painter. Maugham tells this story in a very interesting way and you can read it almost in a day. Personallly I like the beginning and the end most. There you get a good view of the different persons and characters and he tries to explain what art can do. In the middle is a long stretch of narration where Strickland lives in Paris, which  is really too long and I wonder why Maugham did it  because you don't really get much insight into Strickland's character at all. The end of the novel is very well written. Maugham tells the story indirectly by introducing a narrator who interviews various people  who met Strickland during his life in Tahiti.  I can recommend this book to everyone that likes fluent language and an interesting plot.	2001-07-02

Of course Maugham is a splendid storyteller. Of course one could make a five star book out of &quot;Moon and Sixpence&quot;. Yet I do not think it earns more than three and half. I'll try to elucidate why but it's more a feeling and not a list of facts or mistakes I could rattle down. Charles Strickland, the rough, brute, indifferent-to-anything-and-everything artist - to me he seems untrue. He is not an artist, he's no person but is Maugham`s projection of an artist. If you look at the life of  W. Somerset Maugham you will soon realize that he was never that beastly God or godlike beast called Strickland\\" with the vision stuck to his heart like some divine dagger. He was a man of the world that wanted to be more, that wanted to be - Strickland - but either wasn't or couldn't.  And while reading the book I always had that feeling that clung to Strickland, the smell of projection, the smell of a Maugham that wanted to be something he wasn't.<br />Hesse once wrote something like &quot;The thought you do not act, or do not live are of no value&quot;. And Maugham didn't act Strickland, therefore... I wouldn't go so far as to say &quot;of no value&quot;, yet not of the value it claims to be.	2001-07-02

The thing Strickland did was more important than himself as a person. Yet sometimes Strickland gets a bit unrealistic, because he seems to be so selfish and really doesn't care about anything else but his inner urge to paint. The story describes the life of the great painter Gauguin  although he is not mentioned by name but there are a lot of  similarities between the two. Exotic places are also an important part in the novel, which  makes it interesting and easy to read  to read.  On the whole  it's a well written story.	2001-07-02

In fact, the stories build a unity, but every single story is also convincing on its own. How James Joyce reveals the paralysis that Dublin holds upon its inhabitants, is fantastic.   The story that moved me most is \\"The Dead\\". This one scene is marvellous: When Gabriel Conroy sees his wife standing on the top of the first flight, leaning on the banisters, listening to some far away sound... When he \\"paints\\" this picture of hers, calling it \\"Distant Music\\". That's something that reaches one's heart. I was really touched by this feelings which Joyce let his main character create. It's obvious that I recommend this book to everyone, especially to those who're interested in the literature of the early 19th century.	2001-06-26

Even if it isn't comparable with first class literature, for example a S. Maugham's novel with a really valuable background, P. Highsmith's detective novels collection  is praiseworthy. I would say that `Those who Walk Away' is worth reading. She is able to transform  a simple story into a thrilling plot.

As far as I can tell because I've just read the first book which is called \\"The Ring Hikes\\" or something like that. But I must also give a little word of advice, if you really want to read it then you should first read \\"The Hobbit\\" because there the story is told how Bilbo Beutlin, one of a big hobbit family, gets the ring in the first place. So the whole story is about wizards, hobbits, who are like humans only a little smaller and fatter. Then there are elves and black  knights. And naturally the ring plays an important role, because there are also other rings around but only one is able to rule them all and he was created by the dark ruler of the land of Mordor, which tries to conquer  the world.

I'm fond of that novel because it tells you something about the dark side of man and besides that it's also a very profound love story. To be sure it is a really unusual love story because the two main characters never have a relationship like normal lovers have, they only become united after death. I very much liked that Catherine is close to us as readers. She is always present even though she is already dead at the beginning of the novel. But Nelly tells the story of her life and so it seems to the most natural thing in the world to talk about supernatural events and experiences. While reading the novel my feelings changed a lot, once I was very angry at Heathcliff, then I only felt  contempt for Linton and his weakness. The novel is written in very thrilling way, you never know  how Heathcliff will react next, he is so erratic. Even though Catherine is not an innocent person at all, you can feel with her and you can sympathise with her throughout the story. And although the character of Heathcliff is so mysterious and dark he attracts our attention in a special manner: He descends from a gypsy family and thus he represents the hidden and often violently suppressed sides of man.	2001-06-19

The story of a mother with an unfulfilled life and a marriage that was failure, too. A mother that substitutes her own life by the lives of her sons, making their success her victory. The victory that will make her triumph over the share of life she didnt get. Mrs Morel takes possession her sons of the lives, especially of Pauls (the counterpart of D.H. Lawrence). And by doing so she casts a shadow on all of Pauls actions, thoughts, and experiences. Everything he will do he will do it, in the end for his mother. This pressure, this shadow makes it impossible for him to see the light which would lead him along the path of his life and therefore his youth becomes a struggle, a fight against himself. He falls in love, but eventually he isnt able to love. The mother, sitting at home, jealous, is his  conscience and she wouldnt allow anybody to come close to him. And so we see Paul grow up, a person bursting of life yet unable to live. With passion he falls in love, the passion though turns into pain. Pain, the keyword of the book, penetrates every chapter. A sensitive soul, deeply connected with nature, caught in torture. He felt as if his blood was melting into tears or his visionof a sunset: Gold flamed to scarlet, like pain in its intense brightness make us feel how the world of Paul utterly dissolves into torment and struggle. A book that is the vision of pain, not without any happiness, but always a happiness based on pain. This vision comes to us so real, so profound and sincere that the book seems to me an approach on life itself.	2001-06-19

The story is very complex, you never really know what will happen next and what Tom Ripley is going to do. Mrs Highsmith has the great gift of vividly presenting the characters of the main characters, like Tom Ripley, Marge Sherwood and Richard Greenleaf.

The story begins when the animals in Manor Farm stage a rebellion after a rousing speech from Major, a very respected boar in the farm. They chase their human master, Mr. Jones, away and begin to run the farm themselves. At first, all are happy. After Mr. Jones has gone, the animals believe they now own the farm collectively and that they are all equal. The Seven Commandments is soon set up. Among the commandments are &quot;no animal shall kill another animal&quot;, &quot;all animals are equal&quot; and &quot;whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy&quot;.  It is soon decided that the pigs are the most intelligent, and shall be the ones who rule the whole farm. Among the pigs, two leaders emerge - Snowball and Napoleon. Problem arises when Snowball and Napoleon disagree on the plan to build a windmill on the farm. Snowball, a talented speaker, easily gains support. But unfortunately for him, Napoleon plays dirty and Snowball is chased away from the farm.  From here, everything in the farm starts to change. I don't want to reveal the rest of the story, but I think this book is worth reading. Orwell gives very lively description of the whole story which have a good effect to the reader.	2001-05-12

Since we have just spoken about USSR in our history class we found it interesting to recognise the parallels between the characters of certain animals in the book and the real historical figures. Old Major, for example, stands for Marx and Napoleon for Stalin (whereas his megalomania is already contained in his name). What we further like about the book is, that the development of the farm with it's inhabitants is realistic. The film, on the other hand, ends unrealistic. A revolution would never have been possible at that time, because the leaders were too strong.	2001-05-12

It's a story about a farm with animals. The animals try to free themselves from the cruel and unfair human beings. In the Russian history, the human beings represent the so called capitalists, while the animals are the communists. During the story, the animals try to create a state where everyone is equal and free and where no one has to be hungry. But exactly like in Russian history, there are always people who think that they are superior (or even are), and consequently try to dominate and oppress the others. In Animal Farm, these superior beings are the pigs, who, at the end, behave like there former enemies. So you could say that at the end, the situation for the animals (except from the pigs) isn't better at all, it's even worse! This development is also to be seen in Russian history!  That's why I like this story, because it's kind of authentic!	2001-05-12

The animals have to work the whole day and a few of them die. The pigs lead a good life and the others suffer. But the animals can't defend themselves against the pigs and so the pigs keep the power. The book allows a lot of interpretations. The situation reminds to the historical period of communism in Russia with Stalin etc. People who are interested in history should read this book and build their own opinion. If you are not interested in history or politics you should prefer another book or just read it because of the animals. (There is also a funny film).

The play sets off with an impressing scene, the chant of the three witches, a perfect use of language, I dare say. It takes only about a page and I knew it by memory after two times reading. We used to quote it during the breaks, and actually still do so sometimes. &quot;When shall we three meet again...and so forth. After this promising start the language gets quite hard (I'm not any native form Enland, the US or any other english speaking part of this planet). One can follow the action though and every five or six pages there's a reward for your patience, at least for anybody who likes the power Shakespeare's language is able to display in their good or best moments: &quot;Have we eaten on the insane root?&quot; and the likes. Of course there's also the famous &quot;It is a tale, told by an idiot...&quot;. It's for these moments, where Williams knew how to transfere a feeling of one of his caracteres into  the realm of a universal significance, that I enjoyed the play...	2001-01-13

I think that Mac Beth is surely one of  Shakespeare's most huge plays and it also shows  the resurrection of the true history elements. But there is absolutely no tension which is fascinating. For me who am living in our time today, the play was rather boring . Even though there are some elements which are very translucent (like the affair with the witches ), the whole story seems to be a bit like a rubbish. It was a pity that there is not described the mystery of this time. After reading I asked myself why this play is keeping busy so many people and why it is  celebrated? Actually the cruelty is the only effect which made me thinking about the relations between actors  and their destination during the play .

Macbeth for example first a brave good knighter becomes with his fame more and more crazy.

His women influencing and supporting him in his doing ends up gowing crazy, so that she dies at the end. The witches are very important in the play, they transmit the background and stand for the future. They also influence Macbeth in his doing, or at least tell him his future. Which is not only a subject in Shakespeare's time. Even though Macbeth knows that he is in danger of getting in a big trouble he can not do anything .It will probably be very helpful the watch the movie to understand the whole content.	2001-01-12

Although Macbeth has some scenes were cruelty, sex and alcohol abuse is treated, the play is mostly about honour, blood and remorse. Shakespeare writes about a man getting king with killing the old one and loosing the crown after very short period of governing. The author has a blooming fantasy and he uses a rich vocabulary. The problem of a rich vocabulary is, that you almost don't understand a thing. That's a reason why it becomes boring. We' ve seen the play in a new interpretation at the Saalbau in Aarau, which helped a lot for the understanding. The first part of the play is more interesting than the second one. Because in the second part everything gets confusing and becomes very historical. But all in all it's worth it to be read. But there are surely better plays of Shakespeare to read than this one.	2001-01-12

Between these two characters is Stella Blanche's younger sister who really loves her husband and who does everything for him and couldn't live without him. I think it's difficult to get these three characters together for a play with a lot of tension as Williams did.

It is not one of those typical novels about &quot;love-affair&quot;, which all have a happy ending. For a reader there are so many things and problems you can think about (for example what is the relation between an affair and religion). I mean, it is not a normal affair with the typical problems of an emotional mess. Naturally, jealousy is very important in the book. For me, Henry is the most interesting person in the novel because I admire his character. He knows that he is not a very good husband for Sarah and that it is logical that since Sarah misses real love in her relationship she tries to find it in the affair with Bendrix. But Henry is not angry with his wife because he understands her and he knows that he is not able to give her what she so desperately needs. At the end he says to Bendrix that he knew all the time that Sarah had an affair with him. Now he is almost glad to know that her lover was Bendrix. This fact shows that he wanted only the best for his wife. Religion is also very important in the novel. At the beginning, Sarah, who was baptized as a Catholic, did not believe in God at all. But after the bomb-raid she prayed for the first time in her life and made a vow. After this event she thought that God existed. She also tried to convince Bendrix to believe in God. It think it is quite interesting to see how somebody changes his her mind so abruptly.	2001-01-05

William Shakespeare stimulates the imagination of the spectator by fantastic contrasts and the creation of an exotic fairy world. The main theme of the play is the love among different persons&quot;. Like there are four groups of persons, there are four different plots which weave together: First, the wedding of Theseus and Hippolyta, second, the love-adventures of Lysander, Hermia, Demetrius and Helena, third, the quarrel between Oberon and Titania and last but not least the rehearsals and the performance of Bottom and the Athenian workmen of the play of &quot;Pyramus and Thisby&quot;. At the beginning of the play it wasn't very simple to see through the four different plots and the language was sometimes very difficult to understand, but it's nevertheless a nice play you should really know! I think Shakespeare has put a symbolism into that play. The movement of the scenes could mean that the actors leave the real world for a short time, and enter in a dream world, to solve their problems there and come back, when all problems are solved.	2001-01-05

In a way, all the characters  in that play are fools, all in a different way. For example Orsino is a fool because he doesn't realise, that Olivia doesn't love him. He sends servants all the time for reading love poems to her. The only person who isn't a fool is the clown, who you expect to be the greatest fool of all. But he is a very intelligent man and knows the intentions of every person in the play. In a satiric way he shows them how ridiculous they really are. After a difficult start I really enjoyed  reading the play, I just had to understand the old language of Shakespeare and his humour, which is so important for the comprehension of the play. this version of course helps a lot	2001-01-05

Alice Walker writes about the problems between the Blacks and the  Whites, between men and women. But you always have to know that this story plays at the beginning of the last century! It isn't easy to read this story, Alice Walker writes with a lot of grammatical &quot;mistakes&quot; because the story is told by an uneducated woman named Celie. The story shows how  people lived in the South at that time. The man was the boss in the house and the wife had to what he said. But there were a few women who resisted. Walker also shows that the Blacks people are usually not accepted by the Whites. The story is fictional but the themes (Black-White, Man-Woman,...) did really exist and they still exist today!

Sarah, who suffers from the lack of excitement and true love in her marriage, finds in Bendrix the man who can satisfy her desires. But the bliss of the two lovers comes to an end during the bombing of London. While Bendrix wants to check the situation at the frontside of his house Sarah is waiting for him in his flat. But at that particular moment a bomb hits the frontside of the house and makes it collapse. Bendrix is burried under a door that falls in. Sarah concideres Bendrix as dead and therefore starts to pray to a God she doesn't really believe in. She makes a vow promising the Lord to put an end to the affair if only He makes Bendrix live again. When Bendrix enters his flat covered with blood (but alive) she she is so touched by that miracle that she as well wants to stick to her promise. That's where the end of the affair with Bendrix starts. But there was another affair\\" to begin: the relationship Sarah started to build with God. What is interessting about the book is that we learn about the events from different points of view: on the one hand of the narrater Bendrix and on the other hand of Sarah's diary and of letters written by different characters appearing in the story. Once you get into the story you almost can't put the book down.	2000-12-22

It's the story of a family whose members have lost every connections between each other, four characters that desperately seek a last vestige of love to be confronted only with disappointment in the end. It's an autobiographical play, too. I read the book late at night, sometime after midnight had passed, along with a couple of cigarettes and some wine. And it really got me. The feeling of being detached from everything else, to be utterly alone with yourself and the thoughts of your mind, it crept more and more on me with every page I turned. These are genuine wounds that bloom before our eyes like the flowers of torment and sometimes I meant to even hear the echo of the cries of the hurt when my heart beat faster. But if one doesn't want to open up to the sinister and absolutely melancholic atmosphere of the book I can well understand that...	2000-12-11

First I thought the visit of Blanche was just a normal one. But I found out, there is a lot more about it, it has probably been an escape from her old place. But the rumours follow her to New Orleans. More and more the story gets strange and Stanley becomes the person responsible for what happens. This I found well done. The end, when Blanche is taken to the lunatic asylum, fits very well with the rest of the plot.	2000-12-11

From the beginning it is very complex and the relations are mixed up. You never know who is related to whom and figures are very characteristic. You never what will happen next. The play is written for his time very progressive and modern. The women are worried about the name of their engaged men and forget the real worth of human nature. Lady Bracknell wants her children only to marry with persons of higher society and doesn't carry about real love. I can recommend this funny play.	2000-12-11

He wants to be very successful and tries to make himself and his family happy, but does not succeed. People like Willy are very common in today's society. They live the American Dream; everybody wants to be successful. Willy is not satisfied with himself, because he didn't succeed in business life, well, that is how business is. That is what happened to Willy. He let it out on his wife, and his two sons, Biff and Happy. And they suffer under his pressure. He treated his wife like an object, cheated on her, and was constantly telling her to shut up. He completely ignored Happy, and he tried to make Biff into something he wasn't (which subsequently made him incredibly unhappy).At the end of the book Willy kills himself. This shows that Willy's only values in life. The book was a bit difficult to read, because the play shifts between present and past, which makes it a bit confusing.	2000-12-11

The most impressive person for me was Blanche. She is a person who is still looking for love and keeping, but she is not able to find it. The characters are very different and that's the most important point in that play. It's clear to realize the pessimistic character of the author in that play like in The Glassmenagerie. The person I was not able to explore was Stanley, he is a man with self-security and force, but also in a way like a brutal animal, which can not control his instincts. The play shows the way how to try or find the reality in the world. It is very hard for the reader to accept the fact that Blanche should go with a jacket, even though we will know: Now she won against reality, illusion confirms her life. At the end the reader has to imagine the future of all those persons, he has to fill the opened. Tennessee Williams was able to show the contrast of reality and illusion and shows us a part of a pessimistic world we often won't accept!!!	2000-12-11

There were many words, which I haven't known before. But the wordlist we received, was a good help. And as I'd read about twenty pages, I found the book suddenly better than before. I began to read it at home to know what would happen next in the story. And so I had to think a lot about the story, because I found it really interesting. But the end of the story isn't very good. I was surprised that it ended like that. And I was also surprised as I was told us that the second Mrs de Winter had mixed feelings for her husband, and that she was only together with him because she wanted to have a better life, more money. I did not realise that before. I don't know. Perhaps I didn't understand that part of the story. Still, I found the book good and interesting! In one word: A good novel with an end that nobody would expect!	2000-11-30

I think Rebecca is a very interesting and a thrilling story. But sometimes I had a lot of problems to understand who did what and who is who.

It was never boring to read it, it was always so exciting because I never knew what the end would be like. In school we have also seen the film of \\"Rebecca\\" and I found it not so good as the book, because in the film the persons have sometimes had other character traits. For example Mrs. de Winters was a bit stupid, meek and weak there. But the film was good to understand some scenes of the story. I thought a lot about this book and I want to give praises to the writer, Daphne du Maurier.	2000-11-30

At the beginning I knew never how the book would end. In the middle of the story I had a completely different opinion of Rebecca than at the end, and that makes the whole story very exciting. When Maxim told his second wife what Rebecca was like, I could understand her. I could identify with her feelings at that moment and it was clear to me that she was still in love with Maxim. My guess  is that Favell may have burnt down Manderley. The English is easy enough and you will understand it very well.	2000-11-30

But we read the book together into the class and so we talked a lot about this book, and I got answers to my questions. The book tells the story of a young poor woman who marries a very rich man. But there's something wrong in the past of her husband called Maxim de Winter. Before he also had a wife, who he had killed. In order to forget his past he married this new wife. They live together happily in his big manor house called &quot;Manderly&quot; until someone finds the body of his first dead wife Rebecca. Then the story becomes confused and Maxim has to prove his &quot;innocence&quot; My opinion is that Maxim does not use  his new wife only for his own good. So when I read the book I was sometimes angry with him. But that's what makes the book interesting. And so I would advise you to read this book.    Erika	2000-11-30

It describes the way Helen feels in her letters to &quot;nobody&quot; which is in fact her unborn baby, and it  shows the different sights of the persons in the difficult situations. The  story doesn't really surprise you, when you start to read, you can already  see the end, in a way it even starts with the end... The actions of the  people are realistic and you understand them all. And it motivates you to  think more about the problematic, &quot;What would I do&quot;, &quot;How  would I react&quot; and &quot;Would I make an abortion&quot;. When you've  finished the book, you don't really know if it has a happy end or not,  which I think is positive. There are enough books with happy end's and bad  end's... but the end in this book &quot;Dear Nobody&quot; is more real then  many other. After all a really great book!    R.S.	2000-09-15

The novel is interesting to read, because there are different opinions and different views of persons. It's  tensioned, you don't know what it's going to follow. The person who touched  me a lot is Helen.  Helen has to take a hard decision which impresses her  for her whole life. It's not easy to be so hard, as consistent as she is.  She risks losing her parents - her family. It's not sure how her life would  go on. For this reason she takes it more or less easy. She lets events  happen with her and her baby.  Sometimes I had the feeling that she knows,  that her mother isn't always so heartless to her, she is just afraid, that  she makes a mistake she regrets later. Her self-confidence is so big that  her mother can't make her what she wants - to abort the baby. Sometimes I  had pity with Chris. He hasn't got to decide or even to say anything. He is  just there and has to accept what she is deciding. In a way I can  understand her, finally it's her life, she has to be there for the baby  night and day. But she doesn't give any chance to Chris. All he's doing  isn't right, but in fact, he isn't unfair to her. The things he's doing are  normal for a young man in his age, it's just, he can't really imagine what  responsibility he is going to have.	2000-09-14

You can feel with the different persons and you can imagine their feelings. During the  whole book the tension is always there. I think the subject (pregnancy and  abortion) is very important today and this book tells open about the  difficulties when a teenager becomes a baby. You can see how difficult it  is to stand her own feelings at the tender age of sixteen. The book shows  that life could be very hard and painful for example when you have to  educate the baby on your own opinion or that you have difficulties to get a  job or to finish the school. The boys have also to be concerned on this  subject. Girls and Boys have to think what they do. I think the writer will  this bring up to the people. Helen (the main person) felt finally lucky  about Amy her little daughter. Mirjam Wenzinger	2000-09-14

It's a special book, and the interesting thing is, that this could us happen too. It's  hard (or  beautiful) for both, not only for Helen. It's always a tricky  theme when a young woman gets pregnant without wanting it. But I think it's  better when you get the child than choosing an abortion!  Berlie Doherty  chose an interesting and tricky subject for writing a book and she did that  very well. But I don't like books with styles like this very well, I like  books with more action.  I think this book is written for young people, or  it's better when young people do read that book.	2000-09-14
