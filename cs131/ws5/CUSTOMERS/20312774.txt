I cannot imagine a reader understanding him or his near-obsession with Jamie Fraser if they haven't read the Outlander series.  I thought for sure Jamie would show up here and I was disappointed he wasn't in this book.  The timelines might have hindered the possiblility, I guess.   <br />After getting to know Lord John a bit better here, I will say that Claire Fraser's almost rude treatment of him (in the other books)was uncalled for.  John deeply loved Jamie, but he never slept with him, even though Jamie had extended to John a blatant invitation.  I think Claire should have commended John and shown him some respect, as very few people would turn down a once-in-a-lifetime chance to be intimate with the person with whom they are in love.	2005-07-27

And as much as I hate to say it, that baby Jem got on my nerves.  So did Brianna's constant feeding of him.  Poor Roger, no matter what he SAID, I never got the impression that he loved Jemmy unconditionally.  He cared deeply, sure, but I never felt that he'd accepted the baby.  As to love, Roger & Brianna seemed lacking as well.  The author failed to convince me that these two loved each other in any way.  Which is surprising because she did so well with Jamie and Claire.  And Lord John Grey for that matter.  And let's not forget Ian.  What a joy he was!	2005-07-24

The scenery of Ireland shined, which is the ONLY reason this story deserved 1 star, but the girl, Eileen Costello, who was vacationing there, had little personality and it was hard to get to know her because the author gave us no physical description, no hair or eye color, etc, only a slightly tempermental New Yorker whose ex-boyfriend turned out to be married.   <br />Eileen's love interest in Ireland is called \\"Mrs. Daly's son.\\"   <br /> <br />*He has no name.*   <br /> <br />And it was never made clear what it was Mrs. Daly's son saw in Eileen to make her 'the one.'

So I was curious about Addis' age here, since he had to be nearly 20 years older than Marcus and even more than that with DAVID, that other great guy.  It was nice picturing Addis having grown older, and it was interesting getting to know more about David, having read his story already.

And like so many other S.K. novels, this one was almost more about learning how to mountain-climb than a love story.<br />Also, the appearance of characters (the men) from other S.K. books have yet to stand out enough to make me want to rush out and buy that story.  I find I do it because of who the author is.  I will grab any S.K. book I see, even though I'm sometimes disappointed.  In this particular case, Sir Aedan MacBride (Waking the Princess) was an outstanding character, but you'd never get that from his appearance in this book.

After more than 100 pages the best we got was Dougal touching Meg's elbow every now and then and this was supposed to make her melt.

Now we know a hero almost always survives, especially in a romance novel, and unless there is some challenge from a villian or a storm, why give the reader these wasteful pages of &quot;wondering&quot; whether or not Dougal's going to make it?  <BR>And while I praise Susan King's knowledge of history and occupations of the era, we are subjected to WAY too much information.	2004-06-23

And since he was doing Johanna an enormous favor, one that would affect the rest of her life, if she was to have one, I don't understand why she complained and practically blamed Geraint for trying to help her!

Although ultimately a love story, this book also  served as a reminder of the sacrifices made by unsung American heros of the Pre-Revolutionary War and beyond.  Portia Edwards was a delight; lovely and selfless. Pierce Pennington was a magnificant hero, handsome and intelligent and loyal to those he loved.

He was a prig, yet slightly evil at the same time.  <BR>This book had the kind of dialogue I love - very intense, deep, and emotional.  The author just entrances the reader when Aedan & Christina are together, especially intimately.

All were pretty boring.  There's really nothing worth mentioning about the 2nd and 3rd stories, so I'll skip those, but there was much about Jason's character that bothered me.  I don't know if this author truly can't merge the rich with the poor, or if she made Jason the way he was on purpose.  If the latter is correct she created one of those &quot;what's-in-it-for-me&quot; guys.  Case in point:  Dana's brother causes lots of trouble at his high school.  Jason decides to accompany Dana, his girlfriend of about a day, (and even then Dana has no idea Jason thinks of her as that; who would at this stage?) to the school to deal with the brother.  Jason does this because he &quot;...decided it would be good for him to see firsthand what it meant to deal with a troubled lad.&quot;  Forget the fact that Dana was a wreck and Sammy was scared, this was all about  Jason's curiosity.  And as far as charitable contributions go, the fact that Jason often wrote &quot;several large checks,&quot; to charity should never be discounted as &quot;not really doing anything&quot;, but the fact that the word &quot;large&quot; was used was telling.  This was where I began to believe the author was oblivious to how that came across, thereby making Jason pretentious, but trying not to be.<BR>And I liked Dana; she didn't apologize for being poor, but I don't believe anyone would act the way she did in that tavern.<BR>I will say, though, that while I didn't care for these stories, the author is witty in her writing.	2004-04-16

This book is one of those rare romances where you'll always remember the hero and heroine; what they went through and how much in love they were.  Alex was so handsome, sexy, and adorable, without a weak bone in his body.  A very tough warrior, yet gentle of heart. The perfect hero, in my opinion.  Lucy was very lovely and sweet.  She was also brave and intelligent.  How refreshing.  Although Lucy constantly found herself in precarious situations and Alex always came to her rescue, it wasn't overdone and each time it was believable, probably because they were such serious encounters. <BR>But one thing bothered me (it's trivial, I know)- Did they ever once take a bath?

This was a lovely and memorable story and the characters were fantastic.  This author writes SO many wonderful books, it's amazing how she keeps things fresh and original.  No one does it better.	2004-03-31

I average reading 3 books a week and I know a stand-out when I read it.  This is one such novel.  The evil characters were truly evil and were depicted as such.  The main characters, Jason &amp; Kianna, were beautifully done.  (And yes, I do love her name!)  The home they lived in was a mansion like the one in GONE WITH THE WIND, yet it was very cozy.  With all his wealth, Jason was down-to-earth, as you'll see in a scene with the farmer who came to Kianna's aid.  Jason was also very protective of those he loved.  His family was so nice, it was so easy to believe they were real people. Kianna's life before Jason was rather harsh to be sure and she deserved to find a good man like Jason.  A VERY handsome man, too!	2004-03-22
